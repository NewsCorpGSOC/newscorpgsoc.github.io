South Korean court issues detention warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved a detention warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law in December. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Yoon ignored three separate summonses to appear for questioning as part of that investigation, leading the court to issue Tuesday's warrant. Once Yoon is taken into custody, authorities will have 48 hours to decide whether to file for an arrest warrant or to release him, reported the Yonhap news agency. In a statement, Yoon's lawyers called the warrant 'illegal' and said they would file an injunction at the country's Constitutional Court to stop it. Yoon's legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. The arrest warrant is valid until next Monday. But it is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon's official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. Political pressure, however, is building for Yoon to comply with investigators. In an editorial Tuesday, the Chosun Ilbo, an influential conservative daily, said Yoon has 'no legal means' to block the enforcement of an arrest warrant. 'Blocking its execution would itself violate the law and could lead to a physical confrontation,' read the editorial, which urged Yoon to face the investigation 'with dignity.' Meanwhile, the acting head of South Korea's ruling conservative People Power Party on Tuesday called the detention warrant 'extremely regrettable.' South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 — the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s — but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. His opponents accuse Yoon of attempting to restore South Korea's military dictatorship, and say it is necessary to formally remove him from office as soon as possible. The path forward, however, remains uncertain. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon's removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-detention-warrant-for-yoon/7919499.html	2024-12-30T23:54:54-08:00	
US repatriates Tunisian detainee from Guantanamo Bay	The United States announced late Monday the repatriation of a Tunisian man who had been held at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi was one of the first to be held at the facility, which at one point housed hundreds of detainees following the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the United States. Yazidi was captured by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was among a group of about 30 fighters who had crossed the border from Afghanistan's Tora Bora region, according to Pentagon files. The Pentagon assessment said most of the group was identified as al-Qaida operatives or bodyguards of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Yazidi was never charged with a crime and cleared for transfer from Guantanamo in 2009, but there was no agreement in place for him to be sent to Tunisia or another country. The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress in January 2024 that officials had 'completed the requirements for responsible transfer' in consultation with Tunisia. The repatriation leaves 26 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 14 have been cleared for transfer.

Influential people who died in 2024	It was a life that took him from peanut farming to the presidency. While former President Jimmy Carter 's time in the White House lasted only one term, the decades afterward were defined by humanitarian work that affected people all around the world. Founding the Carter Center with his wife, Rosalynn, he became a global champion for democracy, human rights and public health. And he still took time to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Carter was the nation's longest-lived president when he died Sunday at age 100. But he was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2024. Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in February, was a fierce political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, crusading against corruption and staging protests against the Kremlin. He had been jailed since 2021 when he returned to Russia to face certain arrest after recovering in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. Other political figures who died this year include: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi; former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Vietnamese politician Nguyen Phu Trong; U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; pundit Lou Dobbs; Greek politician Vasso Papandreou; former U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, Jim Inhofe, Tim Johnson and Jim Sasser; Namibian President Hage Geingob; and former Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss. The year also brought the deaths of several rights activists, including the Reverends Cecil L. 'Chip' Murray and James Lawson Jr.; Dexter Scott King; Hydeia Broadbent; and David Mixner. Business leaders who died this year include Indian industrialist Ratan Tata; Home Depot co-founder Bernard 'Bernie' Marcus; financier Jacob Rothschild; and Daiso retail chain founder Hirotake Yano. O.J. Simpson's 'trial of the century' over the 1994 killings of his ex-wife and her friend exposed divisions over race and law enforcement and brought an intersection of sports, crime, entertainment and class that was hard to turn away from. His death in April ended a life that had become defined by scrutiny of the killings. Other noteworthy sports figures who died include basketball players Jerry West and Dikembe Mutombo; baseball players Willie Mays and Fernando Valenzuela; and gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi. The music industry lost a titan in producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. His many contributions included producing Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' album and working with hundreds of other musicians over a long and storied career. Other artists and entertainers who died this year include: actors James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera, Donald Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Lavin, Sandra Milo, Anouk Aimee, Carl Weathers, Joyce Randolph, Maggie Smith, Tony Todd, Shannen Doherty and Song Jae-lim; musicians Sergio Mendes, Toby Keith, Phil Lesh, Melanie, Dickey Betts, Françoise Hardy, Fatman Scoop, Duane Eddy and Frankie Beverly; filmmakers Roger Corman and Morgan Spurlock; authors Faith Ringgold, Nikki Giovanni and N.

Trinidad and Tobago declares state of emergency over gang violence	PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO — Trinidad and Tobago on Monday declared a state of emergency due to a spike in murders by criminal groups, a move that grants police the ability to conduct searches and arrests without a warrant over the next two days. 'The circumstances warranting the declaration of the public emergency are based on the advice of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service to the National Security Council of heightened criminal activity which endangers the public safety,' Prime Minister Keith Rowley's office said in a statement. Attorney General Stuart Young said the country recorded 61 murders in December, bringing the year's total up to 623 homicides, an increase from 577 homicides recorded in 2023 and 599 in 2022. Young, speaking at a press conference in the capital Port of Spain, said the public emergency would not include a curfew or restrict people's movements, to minimize the economic impact of the declaration. The authorization for police to carry out searches and arrests without a warrant may be extended up to seven days by a judge, Young said. At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders 'an epidemic' for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to 'hotspots' of crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7919436.html	2024-12-30T19:27:04-08:00	
Jimmy Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease his mission	JARWENG, SOUTH SUDAN — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite plaguing the world's poorest people. Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms up to 3 feet long. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters. Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only the second time in history. 'It'd be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life,' Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates. Carter died Sunday at age 100. Thanks to the Carters' efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14 human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center. The World Health Organization's target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner. That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn't seen Guinea worm infections since 2014 until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got infected. 'Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth,' said Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg. The center's staff and volunteers walked house to house distributing water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry the parasite. 'If someone's hurt, The Carter Center will help,' said villager Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog for symptoms. An audacious plan In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied, and heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of their citizens. Carter was still defining the center's mission when public health experts who had served in his administration approached him with a plan to eliminate the disease. Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second. 'President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far more in global health than we could do alone,' said Dr. William Foege, who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's smallpox eradication program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center's first executive director. Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm's toll on poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water. 'Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly awful disease,' said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign who led the center's health programs until 2015. 'He could sympathize with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to work.' Changing behaviors There's no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as they're slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks. So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors. Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources. The goal was to break the worm's life cycle — and therefore eliminate the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually exterminating Guinea worm altogether. The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within their borders. Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an end to river blindness by 2035. A personal mission Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its initiatives. Carter's fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally. 'He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted,' said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. 'The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference.' Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm. 'But there was no baby,' Carter wrote in his 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' 'Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple.' Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind. Worms in a war zone In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water filters and discover more endemic villages. Carter's efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what became South Sudan but also built trust across communities that resulted in a 'significant peace dividend,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young nation's Guinea worm eradication director. Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99% decline in less than two decades. Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed 'Ghana worm.' 'Ghana was deeply embarrassed,' Hopkins said. Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached zero infections in 2009. 'That was a thunderclap,' Hopkins said. 'It was important throughout Africa, throughout the global campaign.' To the last worm Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained focused: 'I'd like the last Guinea worm to die before I do,' he told reporters in 2015. Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive. Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13 total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate. 'These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate in,' said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. 'You need eyes and ears on the ground every single day.' The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases are so rare, Weiss said. 'I would still like to think we will beat the timeline,' Weiss said of the 2030 eradication goal. 'The Carter Center is committed to this, obviously, no matter what.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-made-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-his-mission-/7919423.html	2024-12-30T18:48:07-08:00	
South Korean court issues arrest warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law earlier this month. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Authorities sought the arrest warrant after Yoon ignored three summonses for questioning. Yoon’s legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. It is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon’s official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 – the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s – but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the martial law declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. The impeachment process is also filled with uncertainty. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon’s removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-/7919426.html	2024-12-30T18:26:41-08:00	
Judge denies sentencing delay for former US Senator Bob Menendez	NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, will be sentenced on corruption charges as scheduled at the end of January, and his wife's trial will be moved from January to February, a judge said Monday. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein in Manhattan rejected Menendez's request to delay his sentencing for his conviction on bribery and other charges until his wife finishes her trial on similar charges, possibly sometime in March. The Democrat's lawyers last week requested a new sentencing date on the grounds that the jury chosen to hear the case against his wife, Nadine Menendez, would be tainted if jurors heard about the outcome of the former senator's sentencing during the trial. Menendez, 70, was convicted in July of 16 corruption charges brought by prosecutors who asserted that he used his power in the Senate over a five-year stretch through 2022 to do favors that benefitted three New Jersey businessmen who paid him with gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. Two of the businessmen were convicted along with Menendez while a third pleaded guilty, cooperated with the government, and testified against him. Nadine Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Originally set to stand trial with her husband, her trial was put off after a breast cancer diagnosis led to surgery.

Serbian court convicts parents of teen who fatally shot 10 at Belgrade school	BELGRADE, Serbia — A court in Serbia on Monday convicted the parents of a teenage boy who last year shot dead nine pupils and a school guard and wounded six more people in a school in central Belgrade. The Higher Court in Belgrade sentenced Vladimir Kecmanovic, father of the boy, to 14 years, six months in prison for 'grave acts against public safety' and for child neglect. The mother, Miljana Kecmanovic, was sentenced to three years in prison for child neglect but was acquitted on charges of illegal possession of weapons. The shooter, identified as Kosta Kecmanovic, was 13 years old when he committed the crime and therefore too young to face a trial, according to Serbian law. His parents were detained soon after the shooting and charged for failing to keep the weapons out of reach of their son. The massacre at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade on May 3, 2023, shocked the Balkan nation, which was used to crises but had not dealt with a mass school shooting. The couple's lawyer, Irina Borovic, said the verdict came as no surprise 'because public pressure was enormous, and the expectations were huge.' Borovic said she would appeal the verdicts. Ninela Radicevic, who lost her daughter in the shooting, said, 'We are not satisfied because no one was held responsible for the murder of nine children' and the school guard. The boy used his father's guns to shoot fellow pupils and others. He walked into the school and first opened fire in a hall before heading into a classroom, where he continued shooting. Elementary schools in Serbia enroll students 7 to 15 years old. Police have said that the teenager called them after the shooting and calmly said what he had done. He has been held in a specialized institution since the shooting and testified at his parents' trial. The proceedings were closed to the public except for the reading of the verdicts. Also convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison for false testimony was a shooting instructor who worked at a range where the boy practiced. The school shooting was followed the next day by another mass killing in villages outside Belgrade. Uros Blazic, 21, took an automatic rifle and opened fire at multiple locations, killing nine people and wounding 12. He was sentenced earlier this month to 20 years in prison. The back-to-back shootings triggered a wave of street protests and a crackdown on widespread illegal gun ownership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-court-convicts-parents-of-teen-who-fatally-shot-10-at-belgrade-school/7919416.html	2024-12-30T17:31:58-08:00	
Times Square ball takes final test for New Year's Eve	NEW YORK — The crystal-covered ball that descends down a pole in Times Square to ring in the new year was taken for a test run Monday, as New York City officials laid out their plans for the iconic New Year's Eve event. Officials flipped a switch to light up the dazzling geodesic sphere — weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal triangles — which then successfully ran up and down a 139-foot (42-meter) pole atop the One Times Square skyscraper. Monday's rehearsal was just one of many pre-ball drop promotional events: On Sunday, fistfuls of confetti were flung toward crowds in the square in anticipation of the 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of brightly colored paper that will fill the air at midnight on New Year's Eve. Some of those pieces will include wishes written by people ahead of 2025. 'This is the crossroads of the entire planet right here in New York City,' New York City Mayor Eric Adams said earlier Monday as he and law enforcement leaders discussed their plans for security at the celebration. 'People tune in at different locations and celebrate as we do the countdown for the New Year.' Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that although there were 'no specific credible threats' to the Times Square celebrations, 'the public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city.' Plans range from 'dedicated pickpocket teams' patrolling the square to sealing off all mailboxes and vending machines in the area. A New Year's Eve ball has dropped in Times Square for nearly 120 years, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 when nightly 'dimouts' occurred during World War II to protect the city from attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/times-square-ball-takes-final-test-for-new-year-s-eve-/7919403.html	2024-12-30T17:24:19-08:00

California to require insurers to boost home coverage in wildfire-prone areas	SACRAMENTO, California — Insurance companies that stopped providing home coverage to hundreds of thousands of Californians in recent years as wildfires became more destructive will have to again provide policies in fire-prone areas if they want to keep doing business in California under a state regulation announced Monday. The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, it would need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said. Major insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new policies in California because of fears of massive losses from wildfires and other natural disasters. In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office. Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers. 'This plan is of the insurance industry, by the insurance industry, and for the industry,' Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. The requirement is under review by the Office of Administrative Law before it takes effect within 30 days. 'Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,' Lara said in a statement. 'This is a historic moment for California.' Earlier rule The new rule is part of Lara's effort to persuade insurers to continue doing business in the nation's most populous state. He unveiled another rule earlier this month to let insurers consider climate change when setting their prices. Insurance companies had said that because they couldn't consider climate change in their rates, many chose to either pause or restrict new business in the state. The new rule to include climate change in rates will take effect later this week. The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, which often serves as the last resort when insurance companies stop providing coverage for those living in areas threatened by wildfires, Lara's office said. The plan could help a homeowner fulfill insurance requirements imposed by mortgage companies, but it is mainly designed as a temporary safety net with basic coverage until policyholders find a more permanent option. The number of people on California's FAIR plan more than doubled between 2020 and this year, reaching nearly 452,000 policies. Wildfires have always been part of life in California, where it rains for only a few months out of the year. But as the climate has gotten hotter and dryer, it has made those fires much larger and more intense. Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 14 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The 2018 fire in Paradise, California, killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes, and some residents have struggled to find home insurance since. Steve Crowder, the town's mayor, lost his house and business. Since then, his family has rebuilt their home but struggled to find insurance. The Crowders were forced to enroll in FAIR Plan earlier this month. Despite paying roughly $5,000, the mayor said his home is insured for roughly $100,000 less than its value and the house's contents are only half-covered. 'You couldn't rebuild what you got for what it's insured for,' he said. His constituents face similar problems. With policies skyrocketing from roughly $1,200 annually before the Camp Fire to $5,000 now — or even up to $20,000 a year for large homes — some have abandoned attempts to find coverage. In the years after the Camp Fire, Crowder said the town has successfully brought back some insurers after enacting new ordinances with high standards to keep structures safe, such as rules regarding clearances, vegetation and fences. While the mayor welcomed the state's new rules, he said he and his constituents are skeptical things will improve. 'Anything that will help get insurance in California, period, is helpful,' he said, but added: 'Let's wait and make sure it happens before we get excited.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-to-require-insurers-to-boost-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas/7919396.html	2024-12-30T16:44:07-08:00	
French prime minister unveils recovery plan for cyclone-devastated Mayotte	Paris — French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou arrived Monday in the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte to unveil a recovery plan three weeks after Cyclone Chido brought devastation. Bayrou, recently appointed prime minister, also updated the death toll to 39 but urged caution, saying the final number could range from 'a few dozen to a few hundred.' Days after the cyclone, Mayotte's prefect, François-Xavier Bieuville, had warned of the possibility of 'several hundred or even a few thousand' deaths. Bayrou's visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron as some Mayotte residents have alleged that the French government had long neglected them. The prime minister said a draft emergency law aiming to rebuild Mayotte within two years will be submitted to parliament in January. And he said local authorities agreed to ban the rebuilding of informal settlements, home to an unknown number of migrants from African nations in the region who hope to make their way to Europe. Many of the makeshift homes were torn apart by the storm. Bayrou outlined plans to restore electricity to all homes by late January, supported by 200 workers and emergency generators. Water production is expected to reach pre-cyclone levels by January 6, with upgrades to the distribution network set for completion by mid-2025. He also announced the deployment of 200 Starlink antennas for emergency communications. Education also faces disruption, with many schools destroyed. Classes will resume January 13, with special provisions for exam students. Temporary schooling in mainland France is also being considered. In Mozambique, also hit by Cyclone Chido, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said Sunday that 94 people had been killed. Malawi's presidential office said the death toll there had risen to 13.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prime-minister-unveils-recovery-plan-for-cyclone-devastated-mayotte-/7919385.html	2024-12-30T16:35:21-08:00	
Four UK Post Office scandal victims recognized in honors list	LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM — King Charles III announced awards for actors Stephen Fry and Carey Mulligan, as well as victims of Britain's Post Office scandal in the country's traditional New Year Honours on Tuesday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined U.K. television icon and writer Fry, 67, and former England football manager Gareth Southgate in being knighted in the latest list. Fry, best known for playing his idol Oscar Wilde in the 1997 movie Wilde and the hit British television comedy Blackadder was recognized for services to mental health awareness, the environment and to charity. Fry, who has a form of bipolar disorder, has spoken openly about his struggles with manic depression. He told the PA news agency that he felt 'startled and enchanted' after receiving the letter informing him of his knighthood. 'When you are recognized, it does make you feel a bit 'crikey,' but I think the most emotional thing is that when I think of my childhood, and my dreadful unhappiness and misery and stupidity, and everything that led to so many failures as a child,' Fry added. Khan, one Britain's most high-profile Asian-origin politicians, was honored for political and public service. The 54-year-old has led the U.K. capital since 2016 and earlier this year became the first London mayor to win a third term. Four victims of the Horizon IT scandal, in which hundreds of subpostmasters were wrongly convicted of fraud, theft and false accounting because of faulty software, were also honored. Lee Castleton, Jo Hamilton, Christopher Head and Seema Misra were recognized with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for their work campaigning for justice. The previous Conservative government unveiled legislation in March to exonerate those wrongly prosecuted and compensate them after a TV drama renewed focus on their plight. More than 1,200 people received honors in the latest list, which was decided by an honors committee. The king or other leading members of the royal family hand out the awards at ceremonies during the year. 'Each and every day, ordinary people go out and do extraordinary things for their communities,' said Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 'The New Year Honours List celebrates more of these unsung heroes, and I thank them for their incredible contribution,' he added. Mulligan received an award as a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) while Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro was made a Companion of Honor for services to literature. Southgate was knighted for services to football after leading England to the finals of the past two European Championships, as well as to the 2018 World Cup semifinal. His eight-year reign ended without a major trophy after England's 2-1 defeat to Spain in July's European final. Also honored were several British athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics this summer, including 800-meter gold medalist Keely Hodgkinson and two-time Olympic mountain bike champion Tom Pidcock. The king also personally honored two of his medical staff after he was diagnosed with cancer in February. His general practitioner, Douglas Glass, who was also attending Queen Elizabeth II at her death in Balmoral in September 2022, and his consultant physician, Richard Leach, were both awarded with levels of the Royal Victorian Order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-uk-post-office-scandal-victims-recognized-in-honors-list/7919383.html	2024-12-30T16:29:28-08:00	
Militancy surge in Pakistan kills 1,600 civilians, security forces	islamabad — A new report on Monday said escalating terrorist bombings and gun attacks in Pakistan resulted in the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians and security personnel in 2024. An independent think tank based in Islamabad released its annual report amid a wave of deadly violence in the country, primarily affecting the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan asserts that outlawed transnational groups have orchestrated violence from Afghan sanctuaries, with their activities intensifying since the Taliban’s August 2021 takeover of the neighboring country. The Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) stated in its Monday report that 60% of the overall casualties in 2024 were among civilians. It noted that the Pakistani military, intelligence, police and other law enforcement agencies 'suffered the highest number of terror attacks and fatalities in a decade.' According to the report, 685 security personnel have been killed since January 1, the most since Pakistan lost nearly 800 security personnel in militant attacks and counterterrorism operations in 2014. The resurgence of militancy is attributed to two key groups: Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Both organizations, designated as international terrorist organizations by the United Nations and the United States, routinely claim attacks staged against security forces and other targets. TTP is active mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while BLA and its allied ethnic Baloch separatist groups conduct insurgent attacks in Balochistan. While the Pakistani government did not immediately respond to the report, an army spokesman addressed a live televised news conference on Friday, revealing that '383 brave officers and soldiers were martyred' during counterterrorism operations across Pakistan in 2024. He did not, however, provide further details. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter Terrorism Department released a statement Monday reporting that militant attacks and security operations against insurgents resulted in the deaths of nearly 150 provincial police force members, with an additional 230 sustaining injuries. CRSS has documented approximately 250 fatalities among Pakistani security forces, including troops, in Balochistan alone. Remaining fatalities were attributed to Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as other regions. The nonprofit think tank stated that its report was based on open-source data and official statements. It routinely publishes reports highlighting the security situation in Pakistan and says on its website that the organization is working to promote research and nonpartisan analysis. The Taliban government has denied allegations that Afghan soil is being utilized by individuals permitted to threaten neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Last week, Taliban authorities announced that Pakistani jets had struck several locations within the eastern Afghan border province of Paktika, claiming the strikes resulted in nearly 50 fatalities. The statement identified victims as 'refugees' from Pakistan. While Islamabad has refrained from publicly responding to the alleged airstrikes, Pakistani security officials instantly provided anonymous confirmation of the cross-border bombardment, stating that the strikes targeted TTP hideouts, resulting in the elimination of over two dozen key militants and training infrastructure. The Taliban’s Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a statement claiming that its border forces retaliated by striking several targets on the Pakistani side of the border. Independent examination of both Pakistani and Afghan claims remains inconclusive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militancy-surge-in-pakistan-kills-1-600-civilians-security-forces-/7919142.html	2024-12-30T16:05:05-08:00

Mali court jails dissident over remarks about Burkina junta	Bamako, Mali — A Malian court jailed a political figure Monday for making critical remarks about the military rulers of neighboring Burkina Faso, a legal source and his family said. Issa Kaou N'Djim, who previously supported Malian junta leader Assimi Goita before distancing himself, made the comments during a program aired on local television station Joliba TV News. N'Djim was sentenced by a court in the capital, Bamako, to two years in prison, one of which was suspended. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1 million CFA francs ($1,600) by the national anti-cybercrime office, the legal source said. Mali authorities closed Joliba TV News in November because of the remarks and handed the private television station a six-month ban earlier this month. N'Djim's jailing follows the disappearance Saturday morning of another opposition figure, Ibrahim Naby Togola, who was due to hold a news briefing that day. According to a statement from his political party, Togola was abducted by 'unidentified armed individuals,' then taken to an unknown destination in a black vehicle with tinted windows. The 'Call of February 20, 2023 to save Mali ' opposition platform, which Togola belonged to, called for his 'immediate and unconditional release.' Mali and Burkina Faso have been ruled by military regimes since coups in 2020 and 2022, respectively, and are both embroiled in political and security crises. The military-led governments have taken repressive measures against the press, suspending a number of foreign media outlets and imprisoning or silencing journalists or critics. Together with fellow junta-led Niger, they formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) confederation. N'Djim previously was one of the vice presidents of the National Transitional Council (CNT), the legislative body of Mali 's military rulers. He later said he favored a rapid end to the so-called transitional period intended to return power to elected civilians. In December 2021, N'Djim was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence for 'undermining the credit of the state,' following comments deemed 'subversive' on social media. He was dismissed from the CNT and prevented from leaving the country several times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-court-jails-dissident-over-remarks-about-burkina-junta/7919123.html	2024-12-30T15:26:37-08:00

December border arrests remain down, ending Biden's term at lowest level	SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as president hasn't happened. There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning, suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the count is preliminary and has not been made public. December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said. It also signals that the final full month of President Joe Biden's presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in office. Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that said 'swift and effective implementation' of asylum restrictions in June resulted in another month below the 2019 average. 'This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement, extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under our laws,' Mayorkas said. Arrests fell by about half from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum limits. Texas' Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona, was fourth. For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration's approach to create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Most legal entries are done through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450 slots a day. Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures, touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/december-border-arrests-remain-down-ending-biden-s-term-at-lowest-level-/7919120.html	2024-12-30T15:22:38-08:00	
Losing your kids to doom scrolling? Greece is building government app for that	ATHENS, GREECE — Greece announced plans on Monday to enhance parental oversight of mobile devices in 2025 through a government-operated app that will help get digital age verification and browsing controls. Dimitris Papastergiou, the minister of digital governance, said the Kids Wallet app, due to launch in March, was aimed at safeguarding children under the age of 15 from the risks of excessive and inappropriate internet use. The app will be run by a widely used government services platform and operate in conjunction with an existing smartphone app for adults to carry digital identification documents. 'It's a big change,' Papastergiou told reporters, adding that the app would integrate advanced algorithms to monitor usage and apply strict authentication processes. 'The Kids Wallet application will do two main things: It will make parental control much easier, and it will be our official national tool for verifying the age of users,' he said. A survey published this month by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children ages 9-12 have access to the internet via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content. Many lack awareness of basic safety tools such as the block and report buttons, authors of the study said. Papastergiou said the government was hoping to have the children's app preinstalled on smartphones sold in Greece by the end of 2025. While facing criticism from some digital rights and religious groups, government-controlled apps and online services — many introduced during the pandemic — are generally popular in Greece, as they are seen as a way of bypassing historically slow bureaucratic procedures. The planned online child protection measures would go further than regulations already in place in several European countries by introducing more direct government involvement. They will also help hold social media platforms more accountable for enforcing age controls, Papastergiou said. 'What's the elephant in the room? Clearly, it's how we define and verify a person's age,' he said. 'When you have an [online] age check, you might have a 14-year-old claiming they are 18. Or you could have someone who actually is a genuine 20-year-old. … Now we can address that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/losing-your-kids-to-doom-scrolling-greece-is-building-a-government-app-for-that/7919111.html	2024-12-30T15:03:53-08:00	
Hotel fire in popular Bangkok tourist area kills 3 foreigners	Bangkok — A fire broke out at a hotel near Bangkok's Khao San Road, a popular tourist destination, killing three foreigners and injuring several other people, Thai police said Monday. The three who died in the fire Sunday night were all foreign tourists, Police Colonel Sanong Saengmanee told The Associated Press. One was found dead at the scene and the other two died after being transported to the hospital. Police later identified the dead as a Brazilian woman, a Ukrainian man and an American man. Five people were hospitalized, including a Japanese woman in critical condition. The others were identified as a Japanese man, two Germans and a Thai electrician. The fire erupted on the 5th floor of the six-story Ember Hotel, police said. Khao San Road is a popular backpacker street in the Thai capital that's also known for its lively nightlife. The flames were eventually contained, and the cause of the blaze is under investigation. Seventy-five people were staying at the hotel at the time of the fire. Sreekanth Kolamala, a 37-year-old Indian national who lives in Singapore and was in Thailand on vacation, witnessed the rescue operation and said that firefighters 'broke the glass over there to try to pull people out.' Sanga Ruangwattanakul, the president of the Khao San Road Business Association, stood outside The Ember Hotel on Monday, looking at the damage. He said 20,000 people were expected at a New Year's Eve countdown event Tuesday night. 'Now everybody’s scared about what happened and they’re scared it will affect the event tomorrow. But definitely there’s no worry because we already had a meeting with the police station and we have over 150 police and district staff to cover on Khao San Road for security,' he said. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt also emphasized the importance of safety following the incident, especially as New Year's Eve approaches, with fireworks and other celebrations planned across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hotel-fire-in-popular-bangkok-tourist-area-kills-3-foreigners/7919114.html	2024-12-30T15:00:13-08:00	
In Carter's hometown, a long-anticipated goodbye begins	PLAINS, GEORGIA — In Jimmy Carter's tiny hometown of Plains, Georgia on Monday, the former U.S. president's death was only beginning to sink in, even if friends and neighbors have been bracing for it since he went into hospice care nearly two years ago. Those in the rural hamlet — a half block of buildings nestled in the shadow of massive agricultural silos — said the centenarian's death was sad, but in the same breath they recounted fond memories of time spent with the former U.S. leader and global humanitarian. Carter's commitment to Plains, where he was born 100 years ago and died Sunday at the modest home he had shared with his wife Rosalynn, is made clear by its residents — most knew him personally or have a family member who did. 'It'll always be Jimmy Carter's hometown,' Kelly Kight, who was born and raised in Plains, population approximately 600, told AFP as she placed commemorative bows near her flower shop on the main strip. She said that more than an occasion for mourning, it was a day for remembrance of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his humanitarian work in particular. Electric leaf blowers and tree trimmers provided a background chorus for the town, accustomed to gussying up quickly since it was first thrust into the national spotlight as Carter ran for president nearly 50 years ago and most recently when he began hospice care. 'When he entered hospice, it kind of became a waiting game for all of the hometown people here in the community,' said Kight, whose family owned a peanut warehouse across from the Carter's and whose father grew up alongside the Carter children. Carter, who had an unlikely political ascent from peanut farmer to the Oval Office, is almost omnipresent in Plains — his boyhood home, high school and the former train depot which served as his 1976 presidential campaign headquarters are now museums under the National Park Service. The town's main drag is festooned with an enormous banner heralding Carter as the 39th president, while a goofy peanut statue with Carter's trademark grin sits near his church, Maranatha Baptist. There, he welcomed visitors from around the world as he taught Sunday school into his 90s. ‘A very fine gentleman’ Carter's death has long been anticipated — he was last seen in public looking very frail at his wife's funeral in November 2023, after 77 years of marriage. His funeral schedule will include a stop at his boyhood farm, before his remains are taken onward to Atlanta and Washington, then returned to his hometown for interment. Kimberly Franklin, who also grew up in Plains, was leaving the Dollar General grocery store Monday, where she would sometimes encounter the Carters shopping like everyday people. 'I am very sad,' the residential nurse, 56, told AFP, adding that Carter was just 'an awesome guy.' Like most in Plains, she had a deeply personal memory of Carter, a profoundly religious Baptist who attended her baptism. Several blocks away, Plains resident Johnny Jones sat in a rocking chair on his porch, across from the high school Carter attended and in clear view of downtown. He was waiting for the bustle to begin. Jones watched as the town came to a standstill for Rosalynn Carter's funeral and as swarms of journalists descended on Plains when Jimmy Carter announced his hospice care. Jones recounted with a twinkle in his eye that the media waited two weeks for Carter to die, then turned around and left. 'I thought he was a very fine gentleman,' said Jones, an 85-year-old military retiree who liked Carter. 'He did a lot for Plains.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-carter-s-hometown-a-long-anticipated-goodbye-begins-/7919087.html	2024-12-30T14:42:04-08:00	
Scores of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners head back home after swap	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and Russia carried out a new exchange of prisoners of war on Monday, with the two sides bringing home a combined total of more than 300 former captives. Kyiv brought home 189 former captives, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Defense Ministry said, while the Russian ministry said 150 Russian servicemen were returning home. The Russian ministry said the captives had been released in Belarus, Moscow's close ally in the 34-month-old war with Ukraine, and would be transferred to Russia. Reuters Television footage in Ukraine showed waiting spouses and some servicemen, many wrapped in blue and yellow national flags, weeping openly as they were reunited well after dark outside a building. A child's incredulous voice resounded over a mobile telephone: 'Dad, is that you?' 'My son is 5 years old now. The last time I saw him, he was 2 years old,' said Serhii, who was captured by Russian forces at the Azovstal steel mill in the southern port of Mariupol, which withstood a siege for nearly three months in 2022. 'That's why my son probably didn't recognize me. I used to have a beard and hair. I lost 20 kg' [44 pounds]. For some former captives, the return to freedom involved adjustment. 'Even now, I'm holding my hands behind my back. It has become a habit of mine,' said journalist Roman Borshch, 29. 'Now, I have to get used to being a free person again.' Video posted by the Russian Defense Ministry showed smiling servicemen on a bus, some calling their families. 'We'll soon be home. How are the children? How is our boy?' one man said. 'I am overwhelmed by emotion,' said another. 'I still can't quite believe that this has happened, that I am back home, that the ministry made such efforts, that we are remembered and valued.' Zelenskyy thanked United Arab Emirates authorities and other partners for facilitating the swap. The UAE acknowledged it helped arrange the exchange. 'The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us. And today is one of such days: our team managed to bring 189 Ukrainians home,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. There was no immediate explanation for why more Ukrainians than Russians were listed as released. The freed Ukrainians included civilians who had been in Russian captivity. Zelenskyy said the returning Ukrainians included soldiers, sergeants and officers from front-line areas, and two civilians who had been captured in Mariupol. Denys Prokopenko, commander of the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade that defended the Azovstal mill, said 11 of his men were among those returning. Prokopenko was brought home in an earlier swap. The Ukrainian body overseeing prisoner swaps said it was the 59th exchange between the two sides since Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor. The swap brought to 3,956 the number of Ukrainian detainees brought home. It said those brought home this year included Ukrainian nationals serving what it described as 'so-called sentences' imposed by Russian courts for various offenses. In the last swap in October, also carried out with assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Ukraine each brought home 95 detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scores-of-ukrainian-and-russian-prisoners-head-back-home-after-swap-/7919089.html	2024-12-30T14:40:59-08:00	
US Treasury: Chinese hackers remotely accessed workstations, documents	WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday. The department did not provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but it said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that 'at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.' 'Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,' the department said. 'Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.' The department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key used by the vendor that helped it override the system and gain remote access to several employee workstations. The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee. The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-chinese-hackers-remotely-accessed-workstations-documents-/7919093.html	2024-12-30T14:39:25-08:00	
US agency takes steps to protect Nevada mountains from energy development	The Biden administration on Monday took steps to protect the Ruby Mountains in northeast Nevada from oil, gas and geothermal development for 20 years. The Interior Department said it had approved an application by the U.S. Forest Service to withdraw 264,442 acres of federal lands in the Ruby Mountains from mineral and geothermal leasing. The application's approval removes the lands from development for up to two years and kicks off a 90-day period for the public to comment on the proposed 20-year withdrawal. The proposal comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to step up domestic oil and gas production, succeeds President Joe Biden, a Democrat who has sought to conserve large amounts of public land. The lands would remain open to mining claims, the Interior Department said. 'The Ruby Mountains are cherished by local communities for their scenic value, cultural heritage, numerous wildlife and benefit to the local economy through a thriving outdoor recreation industry,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. 'Today, we are taking an important and sensible step to pause new oil and gas leasing to ensure that we have the science and public input necessary to inform proposed protections of the Ruby Mountains area for future generations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-takes-steps-to-protect-nevada-mountains-from-energy-development/7919099.html	2024-12-30T14:37:15-08:00	
Finland discovers anchor ‘dragging track’ amid suspicions of Russian subsea sabotage	LONDON — Finnish authorities have discovered anchor drag marks running for several kilometers across the Baltic seabed as they probe the recent severing of important power and internet cables. 'With the underwater operations, we have been able to identify the dragging track at the seabed from the beginning to the end,' said Detective Chief Inspector Sami Paila of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation in a Sunday press release. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length. For the time being, the possible location where the anchor came off has not been established.' The announcement marks the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent months and comes as NATO warns of a growing threat of unconventional Russian attacks in the region. The underwater Estlink 2 power cable linking Finland and Estonia was damaged last Wednesday, along with several data cables. Estonia’s power supply was significantly reduced because of the damage. On Thursday, Finnish police and coast guard officers boarded the Eagle S, a Cook Islands-registered tanker carrying Russian oil from the port of Ust-Luga before sailing it into Finnish territorial waters. The vessel is currently being held off the town of Porvoo, 40 kilometers east of Helsinki. Its crew is being detained on suspicion of 'aggravated criminal mischief.' Russian officials have said nothing about the Finnish accusations or impounding of the Eagle S. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Pesokov said Friday, 'I can't say anything for sure. This is a highly specific issue, which is hardly the prerogative of the presidential administration.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday it was too early to determine whether the damage was deliberate. 'Four cables have been broken,' Stubb told reporters in Helsinki. 'We were able to get the situation under control and locate the ship in question, bring it to Finnish waters and begin a criminal proceeding. There has been substantial damage through the cables.' Finland suspects the Eagle S is part of Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of aging vessels used to evade Western sanctions on its oil exports, imposed in the wake of Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The damage to the Estlink 2 cable is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the Baltic Sea. In November, a Chinese bulk carrier, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of severing two fiber-optic data cables in Swedish waters with its anchor. China refused to allow a Swedish prosecutor to board the vessel, which has since departed the Baltic. Last year, the Balticconnector gas pipeline linking Estonia and Finland was damaged. Ten months later, China said a Hong Kong-registered vessel had caused the damage in a storm. Finland was skeptical of the admission. Estonia has called for international maritime laws to be updated to protect infrastructure. 'The situation that is now at the Baltic Sea, where the anchors have been dropping several times in a row — it can’t be by accident,' Estonian Justice Minister Liisa Pakosta told Reuters. 'These kinds of situations are not typical, not only for our region, but also for other regions in the world. So, [given] the technological developments that we have, we think that it is a good idea to look over international law to make these investigations more smooth.' NATO said Friday it would boost its presence in the Baltic Sea. The alliance staged maritime drills in the Baltic earlier last month as a show of force amid escalating tensions with Moscow. However, formulating a response to unconventional — also known as hybrid — attacks is complex, said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, an analyst with the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 'If there begins to be clear attribution by states against other state actors, then just taking it on the chin and being resilient in the long run is going to be probably deeply unsatisfying,' he told VOA. '[But] if you attribute it or you blame someone, will you intensify the circle? And what are you going to do about it? Because you clearly cannot use the same ‘retributionary tools,’ as it were, against Russia and China. At least not yet, I think.' Estonian authorities said it could take until August to repair the damage to the Estlink 2 cable. The Estonian navy and Swedish coast guards have stepped up surveillance patrols in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-discovers-anchor-dragging-track-amid-suspicions-of-russian-subsea-sabotage/7919073.html	2024-12-30T14:12:23-08:00

Venezuela fines TikTok $10 million over viral challenge deaths	Caracas, Venezuela — Venezuela's highest court Monday fined TikTok $10 million in connection with viral challenges that authorities say left three adolescents dead from intoxication by chemical substances. Supreme Tribunal of Justice Judge Tania D'Amelio said that the popular video-sharing app had been negligent in failing to implement 'necessary and adequate measures' to stop the spread of content encouraging the challenges. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, was ordered to open an office in the South American country and given eight days to pay the fine or face 'appropriate' measures. Venezuela would use the money to 'create a TikTok victims fund, intended to compensate for the psychological, emotional and physical damages to users, especially if these users are children and adolescents,' D'Amelio said. The company told the court that it 'understands the seriousness of the matter,' she said. According to Venezuelan authorities, three adolescents died and 200 were intoxicated in schools across the country after ingesting chemical substances as part of social media 'challenges.' TikTok's huge global success has been partly built on the success of its challenges — a call that invites users to create videos featuring dances, jokes or games that sometimes go viral. The app has been accused of putting users in danger with the spread of hazardous challenge videos. TikTok's official policy prohibits videos promoting self-harm and suicide. In November, President Nicolas Maduro threatened 'severe measures' against TikTok if it did not remove content related to what he called 'criminal challenges.' Parliament is considering laws regulating social networks, which Maduro said after his disputed reelection in July was being used to promote 'hate,' 'fascism' and 'division.' He has accused Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of social media platform X, of orchestrating 'attacks against Venezuela.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-fines-tiktok-10-million-over-viral-challenge-deaths-/7919020.html	2024-12-30T13:16:50-08:00

VOA Mandarin: Outlook for US-China relations in the New Year	As former President Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, Reuters reported on Dec. 24 that China will issue a record 3 trillion yuan in government bonds next year in an effort to rescue its crisis-stricken economy and mitigate the impact of potential significant tariff hikes by Trump. This marks the latest sign of China’s concern that bilateral relations may quickly plunge to a new low during Trump's second term. For a long time, a basic assumption about U.S.-China relations has been that even when relations deteriorate, they won’t fall too far. Looking ahead to the new year, Trump is set to bring an unusually hard-line, hawkish team on China into the White House.

Biden declares day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter	Washington — President Joe Biden has declared Jan. 9 a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter and announced Monday that all federal government offices would be closed that day as a show of respect for the 39th U.S. president, who died Sunday at the age of 100. 'I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr.,' Biden said in a formal declaration issued late Sunday. 'I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.' Biden inadvertently revealed, in March of last year at a national Democratic party event, that Carter – also a Democrat – had asked him to deliver his eulogy. In his statement late Sunday, Biden described Carter as 'a man of character, courage, and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him as one of the most influential statesmen in our history.' He continued: 'He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision lifted our nation and changed our world.' The solemn event Jan. 9 in the nation’s capital will draw all the living American presidents and a host of dignitaries. Biden also ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the date of Carter’s death at public buildings, military posts and overseas U.S. government buildings. Biden has bestowed upon Carter a state funeral, which is a three-stage, multi-day event coordinated by the U.S. military that includes observances in the capital, plus ceremonies in the home state of the deceased. Carter has repeatedly expressed his wish to be buried in his front yard in the small town of Plains, Georgia beside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn. She died in 2023. Carter was in hospice care for two years before his own death, and his death at 100 made him the longest-living former president in U.S. history. In Washington, services are likely to be held at the imposing Washington National Cathedral, which has played host to several previous state funerals, including that of former presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter’s funeral is likely to be attended by all four living American presidents — that list includes Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, former and future President Donald Trump, and Biden. Biden, at 82, is now the eldest statesman of that group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-declares-day-of-mourning-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7919000.html	2024-12-30T12:45:26-08:00

Syria’s election timetable sparks debate	WASHINGTON — Syrians and legal experts have been reacting to comments by Syria’s de facto leader that new elections following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime could take four years and drafting a new constitution up to three years. In an interview with the Saudi news channel al-Arabiya, Ahmad al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, stated on Sunday that holding elections in Syria requires sufficient time to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive political process. His remarks ignited a debate among Syrians and legal experts who believe he and his group, Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), could exploit the transition period to consolidate their control over the country, or that the proposed timeline is realistic given Syria’s fragmented state after more than a decade of conflict. HTS, formerly al-Qaida’s branch in Syria, led the 11-day rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime on Dec. 8. HTS has controlled an enclave in the country’s northwestern province of Idlib in recent years. Anwar al-Bunni, co-founder and executive director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research, described the proposed timetable for a new constitution and elections as logical. 'We cannot talk about a new constitution and elections while Syrians are scattered all over the world,' he told VOA, referring to those Syrians who have been displaced due to the country’s 13-year conflict. According to the United Nations, over 14 million Syrians have left their homes since 2011, with 7.2 million internally displaced, while nearly 5.5 million are refugees in neighboring countries and elsewhere. Bunni said Syrian refugees should return home to secure decent shelter and basic services, enabling them to contemplate and discuss their political future. 'A 3- to 5-year period is realistic before Syrians are fully prepared to vote and participate in politics,' he said. 'We need an independent election commission and political parties, and for that to happen, you need a great deal of preparation.' Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian American activist who serves as a parliamentarian and director of policy at the World Liberty Congress, agreed that a 4-year wait before holding elections was not unreasonable, 'as long as the transitional government is sufficiently diverse, and the interim governance structure remains responsive to criticism while respecting basic human rights. 'However, if this 4-year period is used to fill key positions and institutions with Islamist loyalists to HTS and Al-Sharaa, we may be looking at a planned takeover of governance — a shift from one form of sectarian authoritarianism, justified in the name of protecting minorities, to another, justified by claims of majority entitlement,' Abdulhamid wrote on X, adding that 'the composition of the upcoming transitional government will be a key indicator of where things are headed.' HTS has appointed a caretaker government composed of loyalists to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. In his al-Arabiya interview, al-Sharaa said a national dialogue conference, tentatively scheduled to be held in January, will determine the structure of the transitional government. Bunni said there must be a legal framework for the country to function in the transitional period, noting the need for a provisional constitution. Other experts argue that establishing a participatory system of governance for all Syrians should begin by including all stakeholders in the transitional process. 'Syrians are not naive,' said Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice. 'They know where HTS comes from, and they would want to ensure that they have a say during this crucial time.' He told VOA he didn’t believe Syrians were as overly concerned about the 4-year timetable. Instead, their focus was on what might unfold during that period. 'If the HTS has the intention and political will to establish an inclusive system that allows all Syrians, including Kurds and other groups, to actively participate in their country’s affairs now and in the future, I don’t think people would mind if the process took a couple years,' Alahmad said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-election-timetable-sparks-debate/7918897.html	2024-12-30T11:52:36-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's passing met with mixed reactions in China, Taiwan	Taipei, Taiwan — The passing of former United States President Jimmy Carter was met with mixed reactions in China and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping praised him for helping to establish diplomatic ties between Beijing and Washington while some in Taiwan remain critical of his decision to sever official ties with the island to this day. In a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, Xi expressed his 'deep condolences' and described Carter as 'the driving force behind the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.' Former President Carter 'made important contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations and the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries,' China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV cited Xi as saying. 'China-U.S. ties are among the most import bilateral relationships in the world,' Xi said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to advance bilateral relations. During Carter’s time in office between 1977 and 1981, the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with China, advancing the groundwork laid by former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. In 1979, his administration recognized the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged Beijing’s position that Taiwan is a part of China. He also agreed to sever official ties with Taiwan, charting a new course in what would later become one of the world’s most complicated and consequential relationships. Much like Xi, many Chinese commentators and internet users praised Carter’s contribution to normalizing U.S.-China relations. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said Carter helped to lay the foundation of the 'friendly and cooperative relationship' between China and the U.S. by acknowledging China’s position on Taiwan. While 'his starting point is to safeguard the interests of the United States, during his term, China and the United States of America's common interests have been highlighted and highlighted,' he wrote in a statement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Other Chinese internet users also characterized Carter as being more friendly to China than other U.S. leaders. 'Of all the living former U.S. presidents, he is one of the friendlier to China,' Chinese netizen 'Sheng Yuan Ran Dong' from Heilongjiang province wrote on Weibo. 'He was a good pacifist. He opened the floodgates of history by establishing diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. His good qualities are truly worth highlighting,' Chinese internet user 'Abu from the magic forest' from Jiangxi Province wrote on Weibo. Lu Chao, the director of Liaoning University’s Institute of American and East Asian Studies, said Carter not only facilitated the establishment of U.S.-China relations, he also maintained very good relations with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 'Former President Carter made the right choice that was in line with the trend of global development, the fundamental interests of the United States, and the interests of China. It is still praised by Chinese and American people,' he told VOA. Mixed reactions in Taiwan While reactions from China to Carter’s passing were largely positive, perceptions about the former U.S. president’s complicated legacy in Taiwan were mixed. In a short post on social media platform X, Taiwan’s Presidential Office extended 'sincere condolences' to Carter’s family and the American people. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), said on X that while Carter will be remembered in Taiwan 'for his decision to derecognize the Republic of China' — Taiwan’s official name — they 'admire his advocacy worldwide for affordable housing, conflict resolution, refugees, and other causes.' In contrast to the moderate official response, some Taiwanese internet users criticized the former U.S. president for allowing China to become a major threat to Taiwan. While 'the U.S. is now Taiwan’s strong ally, [Carter and Kissinger] are the ones who made China so difficult to deal with. From the two of them to the Obama era, Washington’s pro-China approach allowed China to build economic growth for decades and that’s the reason why the Chinese Communist Party can keep bullying Taiwan,' Taiwanese internet user Pbtato Hsieh wrote in a Facebook post. After the Carter administration severed ties with Taiwan in 1979, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), later the same year, which allows Washington to maintain close unofficial ties with Taipei while requiring the U.S. to 'provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character' to 'a sufficient self-defense capacity.' The TRA also reaffirmed the United States commitment to preserving the human rights of the people of Taiwan. At the time the legislation was signed into law by then President Carter, Taiwan was under martial law and under the control of one single party, the KMT, which was led by Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan continued under martial law until 1989 and held its first direct presidential elections in 1996. While Carter signed the TRA into law, some Taiwanese analysts say the former president shouldn’t be credited for providing the architecture that upholds the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the U.S. today. 'It was because the government in Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and some grassroots Taiwanese American organizations maintained good relations with members of the U.S. Congress, so the Congress passed a piece of legislation that was more favorable toward Taiwan,' Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 'The Taiwan Relations Act was not directly related to Carter,' he added. Despite his complicated legacy of handling Washington’s relations with Taiwan, other experts say Carter’s decision to sign the TRA into law still helped to build the 'first blocks of today’s U.S.-Taiwan relationship.' 'The de facto relationship that the U.S. and Taiwan have today began with him,' said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. 'I don't think he was the one who sat down and wrote the TRA, but he most certainly is the one who saw through the process of creating this new relationship with Taiwan after the recognition switch,' he told VOA by phone.

Over 13,000 Mozambicans flee to Malawi amid post-election violence	NSANJE, MALAWI — Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. The latest statistics show that Malawi has received about 13,000 refugees from Mozambique in recent weeks, many of them women and children. Authorities say that the number is expected to rise. Sofia Jimu, the traditional leader of the Tengani area in Mozambique, is among those who fled to Malawi. She said a lack of food is the main challenge at the evacuation center where she is staying, adding that three children collapsed because of hunger in just one day. However, she said, the following day she was given 150 bags of maize flour and four bags of beans to distribute to people at the center. The political tension in Mozambique escalated after the Constitutional Council confirmed Daniel Chapo, presidential candidate for the ruling Frelimo Party, as the winner of the Oct. 9 election. Runner-up Venancio Mondlane, presidential candidate for the opposition Podemos party, disputes the results. Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, says more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October. Dominic Mwandira, the commissioner for Nsanje district in Malawi, told VOA on Sunday that the biggest challenge is a lack of resources to take care of the asylum-seekers currently staying in makeshift camps near the border. 'In terms of food and then nonfood items, tents, issues of water, they are several,' he said. 'But we are happy that partners have started coming in, the government is coming in to support these people.' He said organizations offering help include the Malawi Red Cross Society and Plan International. Jane Mweziwina, a program area manager for Plan International in Malawi, told reporters they are working to ensure new arrivals are protected. 'You know women, people with disabilities and children are always vulnerable when they are in a crisis like this. So, our advice to the leadership is that they take special consideration for these special groups of people in terms of accommodation, security, even in terms of food,' she said. Malawi authorities say plans are under way to relocate asylum-seekers to a more spacious center. In the meantime, Malawi’s Department for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Malawi are conducting a joint assessment to identify the needs of asylum-seekers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-13-000-mozambicans-flee-to-malawi-amid-post-election-violence/7918832.html	2024-12-30T10:44:33-08:00	
Five years on, WHO urges China to share COVID origins data	Geneva — The World Health Organization on Monday implored China to share data and access to help understand how COVID-19 began, five years on from the start of the pandemic that upended the planet. COVID-19 killed millions of people, shredded economies and crippled health systems. 'We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative,' the WHO said in a statement. 'Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.' The WHO recounted how on Dec. 31, 2019, its country office in China picked up a media statement from the health authorities in Wuhan concerning cases of 'viral pneumonia' in the city. 'In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, COVID-19 came to shape our lives and our world,' the U.N. health agency said. 'As we mark this milestone, let's take a moment to honor the lives changed and lost, recognize those who are suffering from COVID-19 and Long COVID, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from COVID-19 to build a healthier tomorrow.' Earlier this month, the WHO's Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the issue of whether the world was better prepared for the next pandemic than it was for COVID-19. 'The answer is yes, and no,' he told a press conference. 'If the next pandemic arrived today, the world would still face some of the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that gave COVID-19 a foothold five years ago. 'But the world has also learnt many of the painful lessons the pandemic taught us and has taken significant steps to strengthen its defenses against future epidemics and pandemics.' In December 2021, spooked by the devastation caused by COVID, countries decided to start drafting an accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The WHO's 194 member states negotiating the treaty have agreed on most of what it should include but are stuck on the practicalities. A key fault-line lies between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors and poorer countries wary of being sidelined when the next pandemic strikes. While the outstanding issues are few, they include the heart of the agreement: the obligation to quickly share emerging pathogens, and then the pandemic-fighting benefits derived from them such as vaccines. The deadline for the negotiations is May 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-years-on-who-urges-china-to-share-covid-origins-data/7918778.html	2024-12-30T10:08:32-08:00	
India rocket launches space docking mission	NEW DELHI — India launched a rocket Monday carrying two small spacecraft to test docking in space, a critical step for the country's dreams of a space station and a manned moon mission. The mission is 'vital for India's future space ambitions,' Jitendra Singh, the country's science and technology minister, said in a statement ahead of the launch, which was broadcast live by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced plans last year to send a man to the moon by 2040. The PSLV-C60 rocket, which blasted off Monday evening at the Sriharikota launch site with shooting flames as it soared into the night sky, included two 220-kilogram (485-pound) satellites. ISRO has dubbed the mission SpaDeX, or Space Docking Experiment. 'PSLV-C60 successfully launches SpaDeX and 24 payloads,' it said in a statement. The mission is intended to 'develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft,' it added. The technology is 'essential' for India's moon plans, it added, calling it a 'key technology for future human spaceflight and satellite servicing missions.' It will involve a 'precision rendezvous,' maneuvering satellites orbiting Earth at speeds of 28,800 kilometers per hour (17,895 miles per hour). Their relative velocities will be reduced to 0.036 kph (0.22 mph) to 'merge to form a single unit in Space,' ISRO said. The world's most populous nation has a comparatively low-budget aerospace program that is rapidly closing in on the milestones set by global space powers. 'Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology,' ISRO added, after Russia, the United States and China. India has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space program growing considerably in size and momentum, matching the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag. In August 2023, it became just the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the moon after Russia, the United States and China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-rocket-launches-space-docking-mission/7918747.html	2024-12-30T09:52:50-08:00

Argentine judge charges 5 people over death of former One Direction star Liam Payne	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs. A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison — a form of pre-trial detention — was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October. The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge. The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison. In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names. Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding. Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had 'traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant' in the moments before his death. Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious. Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide. One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne — like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson — pursued a solo career.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-charges-5-people-over-death-of-former-one-direction-star-liam-payne-/7918726.html	2024-12-30T09:34:29-08:00	
State funeral to be held for former President Jimmy Carter	Atlanta, GA. — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. A state funeral will be held January 9 for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who died Sunday at the age of 100. U.S. President Joe Biden scheduled the state funeral for Carter to be held the same day as National Day of Mourning. Biden has also directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days in honor of Carter. Carter was a peanut farmer and a Georgia state governor before becoming president. When he took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s 'commitment to international peace and human rights. 'President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,' Guterres said in a statement. 'His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.' The White House released a statement from President Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday. It said, 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: 'The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S.-backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage; 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the Earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, only 13 cases of Guinea worm were recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 77-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Although his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-funeral-to-be-held-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7918676.html	2024-12-30T09:26:02-08:00	
Appeals court upholds $5 million award in sexual abuse verdict against president-elect Trump	New York — A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury's finding in a civil case that Donald Trump sexually abused a columnist in an upscale department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a written opinion upholding the $5 million award that the Manhattan jury granted to E. Jean Carroll for defamation and sexual abuse. The longtime magazine columnist had testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack after they playfully entered the store's dressing room. Trump skipped the trial after repeatedly denying the attack ever happened. But he briefly testified at a follow-up defamation trial earlier this year that resulted in an $83.3 million award. The second trial resulted from comments then-President Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir. In its ruling, a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected claims by Trump's lawyers that trial Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had made multiple decisions that spoiled the trial, including his decision to allow two other women who had accused Trump of sexually abusing them to testify. The judge also had allowed the jury to view the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump boasted in 2005 about grabbing women's genitals because when someone is a star, 'you can do anything.' 'We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,' the 2nd Circuit said. 'Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.' In September, both Carroll, 81, and Trump, 78, attended oral arguments by the 2nd Circuit. Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement that Trump was elected by voters who delivered 'an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.' Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer who represented Carroll during the trial and is not related to the judge, said in a statement: 'Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.' The first jury found in May 2023 that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her with comments he made in October 2022. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million. In January, a second jury awarded Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Trump testified for under three minutes at the second trial and was not permitted to challenge conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-upholds-5-million-award-in-sexual-abuse-verdict-against-president-elect-trump-/7918643.html	2024-12-30T08:59:53-08:00	
Trump endorses Johnson to stay on as House Speaker after government funding turmoil	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump is endorsing House Speaker Mike Johnson as he prepares to fight to keep his role leading Republicans in Congress. Trump said Monday in a post on his social media network that Johnson 'is a good, hard working, religious man' and said the Louisiana Republican 'will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.' 'Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement,' Trump wrote. Johnson's continued leadership seemed in jeopardy after a fight over a federal funding plan put the government at risk for a pre-Christmas shutdown. Though a deal was reached, the dispute showed the limits of Johnson's influence and exposed cracks in his party's support. The speaker's first two funding plans collapsed as Trump, who does not take the oath of office until Jan. 20, interceded with calls to suspend or lift the government debt ceiling. Johnson, who has worked hard to stay close to Trump, convinced the president-elect that he would meet his demands to raise the debt limit in 2025. Trump had remained quiet about Johnson's fate before a Jan. 3 leadership vote for over a week, even as some Republicans have said they would not support Johnson for the role.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-endorses-johnson-to-stay-on-as-house-speaker-after-government-funding-turmoil/7918609.html	2024-12-30T08:13:39-08:00	
Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts	Nairobi — In 2024, protests by young Kenyans sent shock waves through the country’s political scene, forcing the government to drop proposed taxes and fire several ministers. The youth movement highlighted the challenges Kenya faces as the government tries to increase revenues from citizens who are grappling with the high cost of living and are angry about corruption and what they see as attempts to stifle dissent. As the year comes to an end, President William Ruto’s government and a large section of Kenyan youth are still at odds over the direction the country is taking. The discontent erupted in June as parliament considered a bill that would increase taxes on certain food items and other sectors in the economy to help repay foreign loans and fund development programs. Lawmakers passed the bill, leading protesters storming the parliament buildings and burning a section of it. Ruto, seeing the public anger, declined to sign the bill into law. Nairobi has also witnessed protests against alleged police brutality. Rights groups say Kenyan security forces killed at least 65 people during protests or while in detention during 2024. On Monday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Nairobi to demand the release of Kenyans allegedly abducted from their homes and other places. According to human rights groups, at least 10 young critics of the government were kidnapped by unknown men in the last few weeks. The police have denied their officers were behind the abductions. Speaking in Homa Bay County on Friday, President Ruto said his government will end the mistreatment of youth. He called on parents to discipline their children. 'These children are blessings that are given to us. Every parent should take care of their children, let's work for our children. We, the government, will do our part, and we will end the abductions so that the Kenyan youth can live in peace,' he said. Boniface Mwangi is a Kenyan activist. He says Kenyan youths are united against the political elite who have made life difficult for them. 'The Gen Z movement, they came together, they were united and they had one goal to reject the finance bill which succeeded and they went a set further to demand for political reforms and change of cabinet and some of it happened and that forced the political elite to come together. So for the first time you have Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga and Ruto in the same camp,' he said. Since the protests, President Ruto has formed what he calls a broad-based government. He appointed some politicians allied with former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his 2022 election main challenger, Raila Odinga, to the office. 'We started as divided people and are closing the year with a broad-based government. We have brought many Kenyans together,' said Ruto. Political observers say this move is designed to better manage the opposition to his administration. Martin Andati, a political analyst, says such political maneuvers will do little to ease the public's anger toward the Ruto administration. 'The guys in power behave like nothing happened, but the truth is that the dynamics have completely shifted,' he said. 'The old political class, inclusive of President William Ruto, Raila Odinga, and the likes of Kalonzo, are still stuck in a time up; they are still thinking along tribal chieftains and political kingpins; they are going back to 2007 when these youths are in 2027 already.' Political observers predict a tough political fight ahead, as the Kenyan government and political parties have to constitute a new electoral commission. The current one technically exists, but all the commissioners’ terms have expired. Some are concerned that youthful activists will start petitions to recall members of parliament, a move that, if successful, may lead to the fall of the government and an early election before 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-grapples-with-protests-despite-political-unity-efforts-/7918553.html	2024-12-30T07:58:21-08:00

German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election	Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor in protest. 'Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense,' government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements. She did, however, say that 'it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement.' In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country's stagnant economy. Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. He went on to say the far-right party 'can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality.' The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party. An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image. 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk's commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper's own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk's social media platform, X. 'I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print,' Eva Marie Kogel wrote. The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform. Musk's opinion piece in the Welt am Sonntag was accompanied by a critical article by the future editor-in-chief of the Welt group, Jan Philipp Burgard, who wrote that while some of Musk's diagnoses of Germany's problems may be correct 'his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-government-seeks-to-downplay-musk-s-backing-of-far-right-party-ahead-of-general-election-/7918445.html	2024-12-30T06:29:47-08:00	
Politician among protesters arrested in Kenya while calling for end to alleged abductions	Nairobi — An opposition politician and several other protesters were arrested in Kenya on Monday during street demonstrations calling for an end to alleged abductions, that recently targeted young government critics. Senator Okiya Omtatah had joined hundreds of protesters who sat down on the streets of the capital, Nairobi while chanting that police should free seven people abducted this month. Police hurled tear gas canisters at the protesters and when Omtatah and several others did not disperse and held on to a long chain, they were arrested. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Thursday raised concern over a growing number of alleged kidnappings of government critics, saying that the total number of such cases stands at 82 since the anti-government protests in June. President William Ruto on Saturday said the government would stop the abductions so that young people live in peace. Rights groups allege the country's police force is behind such kidnappings, but police have denied involvement and have said that they are investigating the disappearances. Senator Omtatah on Monday filed a case at the High Court in Nairobi seeking to compel the government to free seven youths, accusing the police of abducting them. 'If they have committed a crime, let them be prosecuted and presented in court to defend themselves,' he said. Young protesters said they were in solidarity with those abducted while going about their daily lives. 'We are existing at a time where we have to live in fear,' a protester, Orpah Thabiti said. Four social media users went missing after they shared AI-generated images of President Ruto that were deemed offensive by government supporters. The rights commission had warned that Kenya was heading back to the 'dark days' of the disappearance of government critics. The abduction and torture of the opposition were common under the administration of the late President Daniel Moi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/politician-among-protesters-arrested-in-kenya-while-calling-for-an-end-to-alleged-abductions-/7918432.html	2024-12-30T06:12:15-08:00	
China unveils new assault ship and futuristic fighter jets	Taipei, Taiwan — Days after unveiling the latest breakthroughs in its military modernization, the Chinese navy has set afloat a new amphibious assault ship that could launch fighter jets, and videos have been circulating online showing what seems to be China's new generation of stealth fighter jets. On Sunday, China's first Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, left the dockyard in Shanghai after the People's Liberation Army Navy, or PLA Navy, launched it into the water at a ceremony last Friday. The ship, which has a full load displacement of more than 40,000 tons, features a double island superstructure, a full-length flight deck, and an electromagnetic catapult system, which allows it to launch fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. In addition to the catapult system, the Sichuan has arresting technology that allows fighter jets to land on its deck. With its large displacement, the vessel 'can carry more weapons and equipment, has longer range and stronger combat capabilities,' Chinese military expert Zhang Junshe told Chinese state-run Global Times. Zhang added that the Sichuan 'has outstanding capabilities in air superiority and land assault missions' because the electromagnetic catapult system offers higher launch efficiency and faster launch speed. The PLA Navy said the Sichuan is a 'key asset' for enhancing the Chinese Navy's long-range operational capabilities and facilitating its ongoing transformation. Other analysts say Beijing wants to project military power 'beyond its shores' through the launch of the Sichuan. The launch is intended 'to intimidate neighbors or ensure the PLA has the capability to land a large invasion force on Taiwan,' Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official, said in a written response to VOA. In combat scenarios, experts say the Sichuan could be paired up with China's aircraft carrier groups. 'The Chinese military could use the Sichuan to deploy drones during the first wave of attack and then deploy larger fighter jets from its aircraft carriers later,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping said the Sichuan could be used in the South China Sea, East China Sea, or a potential military conflict against Taiwan. 'If [China] takes military actions against Taiwan, [Beijing] will use whatever weapons it possesses, including the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 076 amphibious assault ship,' he told VOA. Since its establishment in 1949, the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring Taiwan under its control, even by force. The launch of the Sichuan reflects China's ongoing efforts to rapidly expand the number of its naval vessels in recent years. 'The Chinese have been producing ships at an unprecedented rate and you can't say the same of the United States' shipbuilding rate,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. In terms of numbers, the PLA navy has a bigger fleet than the U.S. Navy, and its capabilities are confined in one theater, he adds. 'A growing PLA Navy that is operationally more focused on the theater is likely going to have a certain advantage over the U.S. Navy that is still considered having to bear with various global responsibilities other than this part of the world,' Koh told VOA by phone. A new generation of fighter jets In addition to the launch of the new amphibious assault ship, several videos and images of two seemingly new Chinese stealth fighter jets flying in broad daylight were circulating online last Friday. The images and videos of the two fighter jets posted online have a triangular, tailless design typical to stealth fighter jets. The larger fighter jet, accompanied by China's J-20 stealth fighter jet, seems to have three air intakes for its engines, while the smaller fighter jet bears a more conventional layout. The Chinese government has yet to comment on the unnamed fighter jets featured in the videos, but analysts say their advanced designs show China is rapidly catching up with the U.S. and its Western allies. 'Apart from trying to become a sea power, these seemingly new fighter jets show China also wants to eventually replace the U.S. as the leading air power in the world,' Su in Taiwan told VOA. In his view, because the U.S. and its Western allies still control access to advanced semiconductor chips used in next-generation fighter jets, Washington needs to maintain strict export control of advanced semiconductor ships to China to stay ahead of the curve in the military aircraft arms race. 'Imposing strict export control on advanced semiconductor ships will become the key geopolitical chokepoint that Washington can leverage against Beijing in the global arms race,' Su said.

Iran confirms arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala	Dubai — Iran confirmed the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday. Sala, 29, who works for the newspaper Il Foglio and the podcast company Chora Media, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, according to the Italian foreign ministry. Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani on Saturday declined to say whether the case might be linked to the arrest of an Iranian in Italy this month at the request of the United States. The case of the Italian journalist being held in Iran is 'complicated,' but Rome hopes to bring Sala home quickly, Tajani said. 'Italian national Cecilia Sala traveled to Iran on Dec. 13 with a journalist visa and was detained on Dec. 19... for violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' a statement by Iran's Culture Ministry said, according to IRNA. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on Dec. 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on Dec. 20. Sala has been in contact by phone with her family and the Italian embassy in Tehran was notified of her detention, the statement said. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies taking prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-confirms-arrest-of-italian-journalist-cecilia-sala-/7918304.html	2024-12-30T04:44:53-08:00	
WHO chief calls for end to attacks on Gaza hospitals	World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday the health system in the Gaza Strip is 'under severe threat' as he called for an end to Israeli attacks on hospitals. 'People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need access to provide health aid. Ceasefire!' Tedros said in a statement. Tedros also called for the immediate release of Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, who was detained by Israeli forces along with more than 200 Palestinians last week. At the time, the Israeli military said the hospital was being used by militants and that Safiya was being questioned as a suspected Hamas member. The hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, was one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. 'Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is out of service — following the raid, forced patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya two days ago. His whereabouts are unknown,' Tedros said. The WHO chief also said the agency’s partners were able to carry out deliveries of medical supplies, food and water to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began with the October 2023 attack on southern Israel, during which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 people and injured 108,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Taliban say they will close all NGOs employing Afghan women	The Taliban say they will close all national and foreign nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan employing women. It comes two years after they told NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, allegedly because they didn’t wear the Islamic headscarf correctly. In a letter published on X Sunday night, the Economy Ministry warned that failure to comply with the latest order would lead to NGOs losing their license to operate in Afghanistan. The ministry said it was responsible for the registration, coordination, leadership and supervision of all activities carried out by national and foreign organizations. The government was once again ordering the stoppage of all female work in institutions not controlled by the Taliban, according to the letter. 'In case of lack of cooperation, all activities of that institution will be canceled and the activity license of that institution, granted by the ministry, will also be canceled.' It’s the Taliban’s latest attempt to control or intervene in NGO activity. Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council heard that an increasing proportion of female Afghan humanitarian workers were prevented from doing their work even though relief work remains essential. According to Tom Fletcher, a senior U.N. official, the proportion of humanitarian organizations reporting that their female or male staff were stopped by the Taliban’s morality police has also increased. The Taliban deny they are stopping aid agencies from carrying out their work or interfering with their activities. They have already barred women from many jobs and most public spaces, and also excluded them from education beyond sixth grade. In another development, the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has ordered that buildings should not have windows looking into places where a woman might sit or stand. According to a four-clause decree posted on X late Saturday, the order applies to new buildings as well as existing ones. Windows should not overlook or look into areas like yards or kitchens. Where a window looks into such a space then the person responsible for that property must find a way to obscure this view to 'remove harm,' by installing a wall, fence or screen. Municipalities and other authorities must supervise the construction of new buildings to avoid installing windows that look into or over residential properties, the decree added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing was not immediately available for comment on Akhundzada’s instructions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-say-they-will-close-all-ngos-employing-afghan-women/7918279.html	2024-12-30T03:46:07-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 21 of 43 Russian drones	Ukraine's military said Monday it shot down 21 drones that Russian forces used in attacks overnight targeting multiple areas across northern and eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched a total of 43 drones, and that its air defenses shot down drones over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Poltava regions. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged five residential buildings but did not hurt anyone. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported a building fire caused by a drone attack, as well as a drone hit near a highway. He added there were no casualties in his region. Russia's defense ministry said Monday it intercepted a drone over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Regional officials in Kursk also said Russian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian missile early Monday.

Linda Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom 'Alice,' dies at 87	NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom 'Alice,' has died. She was 87. Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. The title was shortened to 'Alice' and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song 'There's a New Girl in Town,' ran from 1976 to 1985. The show turned 'Kiss my grits' into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner. The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into 'All in the Family' on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's 'Broadway Bound' in 1987. She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, 'No Good Deed,' and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, 'Mid-Century Modern,' according to Deadline, which first reported her death. Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical 'It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman.' She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, 'Broadway Bound.' In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on 'Barney Miller' and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn's Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.' Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy 'The New Century,' had a concert show called 'Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress' and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' 'Collected Stories.' Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in 'Collected Stories,' writing that she 'gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.' Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's 'The Lyons.' She also starred in 'Other Desert Cities' and a revival of 'Follies' before they transferred to Broadway. The AP again raved about Lavin in 'The Lyons,' calling her 'an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length.' She also appeared in the film 'Wanderlust' with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, 'Possibilities.' She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in 'The Back-Up Plan.' When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. 'I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,' she told the AP in 2011. She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. It opened in 2007 and their productions include 'Doubt' by John Patrick Shanley, 'Glengarry Glen Ross' by David Mamet, 'Rabbit Hole' by David Lindsay-Abaire and 'The Tale of the Allergist's Wife' by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. She returned to TV in 2013 in 'Sean Saves the World,' starring 'Will & Grace's' Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on 'Mom' and '9JKL.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/linda-lavin-tony-winning-broadway-actress-who-starred-in-sitcom-alice-dies-at-87-/7918230.html	2024-12-30T01:39:28-08:00	
Sports teams honor late former US President Jimmy Carter	Sports teams in former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's home state of Georgia expressed their condolences Sunday, honoring a former leader who also served as the state's governor and had an extensive record as an athlete and sports fan. The Atlanta Falcons football team held a moment of silence before their game Sunday night. The team's owner, Arthur Blank, called Carter 'a great American, a proud Georgian and an inspirational global humanitarian.' The Atlanta Hawks basketball team said Carter 'represented all the best of Georgia.' 'From his rural upbringing that he never strayed from, to his passion for Atlanta sports, Carter was proud of his home state and left a legacy for Georgians to be proud of, too,' the team said in a statement. Carter was most known for being a fan of the Atlanta Braves baseball team, whose games he and his wife, Rosalynn, attended for decades. The team celebrated his 100th birthday in October, and on Sunday it said Carter 'served both his country and home state with honor his entire life.' 'While the world knew him as a remarkable humanitarian and peacemaker, we knew him as a dedicated Braves fan and we will miss having him in the stands cheering on his Braves,' the team said in a statement. Carter was in attendance in 1974 when Braves player Hank Aaron set the Major League Baseball record for most career home runs. In 1995, Carter threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the sixth game of the World Series, which the Braves won to capture their first championship since moving to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966. As an athlete himself, Carter was fond of playing softball, including during his time as president. While in the White House, Carter was also part of a boom in running in the United States that saw recreational running rapidly expand during the 1970s. His competitive running career included time on the U.S. Naval Academy cross-country team. Carter also enjoyed playing tennis and watching car racing, and he participated in the presidential tradition of welcoming championship sports teams to the White House.

South Korea mourns as investigators probe cause of deadly plane crash	South Korea was in mourning Monday as investigators worked to determine the cause of a plane crash in Muan that killed 179 of the 181 people on board. Acting President Choi Sang-mok appeared Monday at a memorial in Muan, about 290 kilometers south of Seoul, where he laid a flower and bowed in respect to the victims. A senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport told reporters that officials planned to conduct a special investigation of all the Boeing 737-800 planes operating in the country. The crashed plane's flight data recorder will be sent to a facility in Seoul later this week for analysis, officials said, with personnel from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board taking part in the probe. Some passengers still unidentified Sunday's crash in which the plane skidded off the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames was one of South Korea's deadliest aviation disasters. As of early Monday, authorities were still trying to identify some of the victims. Two people, both crew members, were pulled out of the wreckage alive. 'Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of [it] looks almost impossible to recognize,' Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told reporters as he described what was left of the plane. Lee added that investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the incident. President Joe Biden said the United States was ready to offer any assistance needed in the wake of the disaster. 'As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by this tragedy. The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance,' Biden said in a statement released by the White House. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement released Sunday, 'The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the news of a plane crash in Muan county in the Republic of Korea, which has claimed the lives of 179 people. 'He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and Government of the Republic of Korea during this difficult time,' the statement said. Boeing 'ready to support' Sunday's crash was the worst aviation disaster involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet went down in Guam, killing more than 200 people. Jeju Air issued an apology following the crash and promised to do its 'utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.' Boeing said it was in touch with Jeju Air and was 'ready to support them.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,' the company said in a statement. Transport ministry officials said two Thai nationals were on board and the rest were believed to be South Koreans. Officials in Thailand reported no issues with the plane when it left Bangkok.

Stock market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech giants	Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company's jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on December 3 amounted to rebellion. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the 'Magnificent 7,' which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global trade. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 1 cent to $70.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $73.78 per barrel. The euro fell to $1.0427 from $1.0433.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stock-market-today-asian-shares-mixed-after-wall-street-slips-led-by-tech-giants-/7918180.html	2024-12-29T22:49:12-08:00	
Authorities find bodies of 15 men in clandestine graves in Mexico	TAPACHULA, MEXICO — Eleven clandestine graves with the bodies of 15 men were located in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, where a dispute between the Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generacion drug cartels is taking place, local authorities said Sunday. Chiapas Governor Eduardo Ramirez Aguilar said on his social media channels that the findings came as the result of a raid in the city of La Concordia, near Mexico's border with Guatemala. He said four people connected to the case had been arrested with weapons and drugs. The state prosecutor's office said in a statement that the raid took place in two different properties. The first site had three bodies in three graves and in the second, eight graves with 12 bodies. 'It is worth mentioning that for these operations technological tools such as drones and geo-radars were used, in addition to aerial overflight, ground search, field forensics, back-excavation and drills,' it said. Chiapas Prosecutor General Jorge Luis Llaven Abarca said last week that another clandestine grave with charred bodies was found in Emiliano Zapata, neighboring La Concordia, but did not give more details because of the poor state of the bodies for identification. The dispute over drug routes, migrant trafficking and weapons has left more than 10,000 people displaced in recent years, including Mexicans fleeing to Guatemala, according to reports from humanitarian organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-find-bodies-of-15-men-in-clandestine-graves-in-mexico-/7918175.html	2024-12-29T22:21:26-08:00	
Storm system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths	Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning tornadoes and killing at least four people. There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. 'It's not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,' said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the city on Saturday. At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30 meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged. In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith said. In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said 'it was just a freak accident' and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 'It's very sad, just terrible timing,' Maffucci said, adding that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and 'quite a few wrecks.' Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville. Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said of the storm. 'I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities.' As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had about 10,000 customers without power, it said. The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the organization's supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about 152 millimeters of rain fell. He's spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene. The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene, Fromkin said, and Sunday's downpour adds to the problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-system-spawns-tornadoes-across-us-leading-to-4-deaths-/7918166.html	2024-12-29T21:41:42-08:00	
Netanyahu 'in good condition' after prostate surgery, says hospital	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully underwent prostate removal surgery on Sunday and is in good condition, according to the hospital treating him. The surgery took place while Israel remains at war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, more than 14 months after an unprecedented attack by Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7 last year. 'The prime minister has awakened from anesthesia and is in good condition. He has been transferred to the recovery unit and will remain under observation in the coming days,' the Hadassah Medical Centre said in a statement. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement. Earlier, in March, Netanyahu underwent a hernia surgery, and in July last year, doctors implanted a pacemaker after a medical scare.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-in-good-condition-after-prostate-surgery-says-hospital/7918162.html	2024-12-29T20:56:53-08:00	
Waves pound coasts of Ecuador and Peru, closing ports, killing 2	LIMA, PERU — Big waves of up to four meters are pummeling the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, leaving scores of ports closed and at least two people dead, authorities said Sunday. Ecuador's secretary for risk management, Jorge Carillo, told a media conference that an 'extreme event' was occurring and warned that similar phenomena could be expected in the future. He said that 'unfortunately, we have two deaths, both recorded' in Ecuador's southwestern Manta region. In neighboring Peru, almost all ports were closed because of the constant battering of waves, the head of the naval Oceanographic Department, Enrique Varea, told the broadcaster Canal N. He forecast that the big waves 'will continue in coming days,' but expected them to calm somewhat from Monday, and to return more to normal in the first days of January. Climate change 'is behind these sorts of anomalous waves,' the head of the Civil Defense unit in Peru's Callao region, Larry Linch, told AFP. Images shown on local media showed jetties and public squares submerged in some parts of Peru, sending residents fleeing to higher ground. The waves, according to the Peruvian navy, are being generated off the U.S. coast by winds along the ocean's surface. Many beaches along the central and northern stretches of the country were closed to prevent risk to human life, authorities said. Many fishing boats were damaged, while those that were spared were still unable to work in the dangerous conditions. 'We need help from authorities. Here, we've lost some 100 boats,' one fisherman told TV Peru. 'I'm 70 years old and I've never seen such unusual and strong waves,' he said. Thirty-one fishermen stranded in the swell were rescued Saturday afternoon by the navy, while one told local radio that around 180 more remained at sea. Big waves were also seen crashing into the central Chilean coast in Vina del Mar, sparking warnings from authorities. Callao, which sits adjacent to the capital Lima and is home to Peru's largest port, has closed several beaches and barred tourist and fishing boats from venturing out. 'There is a major problem,' La Cruz district mayor Roberto Carrillo Zavala told AFP after surveying damage via helicopter with Peru's Minister of Defense Walter Astudillo Chavez. 'The most affected have been the fishermen,' Zavala said. 'We hope nothing more happens, as this would significantly impact the economy.' The phenomenon began on Christmas and will last until January 1, according to Peru's National Emergency Operations Center.	https://www.voanews.com/a/waves-pound-coasts-of-ecuador-and-peru-closing-ports-killing-2-/7918145.html	2024-12-29T20:22:23-08:00	
South Korea joint investigation unit requests arrest warrant for Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's joint investigation unit has requested an arrest warrant for suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this month, an official said on Monday. Yoon has failed to respond to multiple summons for questioning by police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials who are jointly investigating whether his December 3 martial-law declaration amounted to insurrection. A court will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant following the request. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for the suspended president, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Yoon was suspended from presidential powers after being impeached by parliament earlier this month over his decision to briefly impose martial law. A Constitutional Court trial is ongoing into whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. On December 27, the court held its first preparatory hearing where a request by Yoon's lawyers for a postponement in proceedings to better prepare was denied. The court said it would move swiftly. The next hearing is due on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-joint-investigation-unit-requests-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-over-martial-law-/7918130.html	2024-12-29T18:48:07-08:00	
Finland finds drag marks on Baltic seabed after cable damage	OSLO, NORWAY — Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometers along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor. The Cook Islands-registered Eagle S was boarded by Finnish police and coast guard officials on Thursday and sailed into Finnish waters where the crew of the impounded tanker is being questioned. Baltic Sea nations have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said on Friday it would boost its presence in the region. A break in the 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia occurred at midday on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking the two countries, grid operators said. They said Estlink 2 might not be back in service before August. Finnish police suspect the Eagle S caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Investigators have identified a 'dragging track' but have yet to find a missing anchor, Sami Paila, tactical leader and detective chief inspector of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, said in a statement. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length,' Paila said. Photos taken of the Eagle S on Friday showed the vessel missing its port side anchor. Finland's customs service believes the ship is part of a 'shadow fleet' of aging tankers being used to evade sanctions on exports of Russian oil. The Kremlin said on Friday that Finland's seizure of the ship was of little concern to it. Russia has denied involvement in any of the previous Baltic infrastructure damage incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-finds-drag-marks-on-baltic-seabed-after-cable-damage-/7918122.html	2024-12-29T17:55:08-08:00

World leaders react to former US President Jimmy Carter's death	World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at age 100. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden 'Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian. Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump 'The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.' President Barack Obama 'Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did – advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection – things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. ... Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away – buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.' President George W. Bush 'Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family. James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.' Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 'From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity -- he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.' French President Emmanuel Macron 'Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace. France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American people.' Vice President Kamala Harris 'Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center. I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.' Vice President-elect JD Vance 'Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in Peace.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 'Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants, President Jimmy Carter. President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity. From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 'I was very sorry to hear of President Carter's passing and I would like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service. His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize. Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights at home and abroad.' US Senator Mitch McConnell 'Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. 'President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most.' US House Speaker Mike Johnson 'Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.' US Representative Mike Turner 'I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family.' US Senator Mark Warner 'President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home.' US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin 'Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-leaders-react-to-former-us-president-jimmy-carter-s-death/7918097.html	2024-12-29T16:24:58-08:00

Key moments in the life of Jimmy Carter	Jimmy Carter's 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see him as weak — and send him packing after only one term. Carter's legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency, the longest in U.S. history. Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100. The Panama Canal During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of the 20th century. 'Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world,' he said at the signing of the canal treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977. Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999. History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of diplomacy. Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal's management in the run-up to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America's image as an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America. Morality in politics Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his agenda. 'Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice, political self-determination and basic human rights,' he said in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy. In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate. Camp David Accords In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington. After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter's mediation, two accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following year. The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Crisis of confidence In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a nationwide televised speech on July 15. In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of leadership, instead laying the blame on a national 'crisis of confidence.' 'The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America,' he said. The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five cabinet members resigned that week. Iran hostage crisis The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the death knell for Carter's presidency. A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished his chances of reelection later that year. Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight servicemen. In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned, and the mission's failure symbolized Carter's inability to resolve the crisis. The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in November 1980. The Carter Center Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement from political life. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting disease. Carter — often viewed as America's most successful former president — traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor, and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator. The Elders Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human rights. Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-moments-in-the-life-of-jimmy-carter/7917840.html	2024-12-29T15:02:21-08:00

Israeli hospital says Netanyahu has undergone successful prostate surgery	Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful surgery Sunday to have his prostate removed, hospital officials said, a procedure that came as he manages multiple crises including the war in Gaza and his trial for alleged corruption. Netanyahu, who has had a series of health issues in recent years, has gone to great lengths to bolster a public image of himself as a healthy, energetic leader. During his trial this month, he boasted about working 18-hour days, accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could take a toll on his well-being. Netanyahu, 75, is among older world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, President-elect Donald Trump, 78, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 79, and Pope Francis, 88, who have come under scrutiny for their age and health issues. Netanyahu's latest condition is common in older men, but the procedure has had some fallout. The judges overseeing his trial accepted a request Sunday from his lawyer to call off three days of testimony scheduled this week. The lawyer, Amit Hadad, had argued that Netanyahu would be fully sedated for the procedure and hospitalized for 'a number of days.' Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center announced late Sunday that the procedure had been 'completed successfully.' Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close ally, served as acting prime minister during the operation. Netanyahu is expected to remain hospitalized for several days. With so much at stake, Netanyahu’s health in wartime is a concern for both Israelis and the wider world. A turbulent time in the region As Israel’s leader, Netanyahu is at the center of major global events that are shifting the Middle East. With the dizzying pace of the past 14 months, being incapacitated for even a few hours can be risky. Netanyahu will be in the hospital at a time when international mediators are pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and as fighting between Israel and Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels intensifies. Prostate issues are common and, in many cases, easily treatable. Still, the procedure puts a dent in Netanyahu’s image of vigor at a time when he would want to project strength more than ever, both to an Israeli audience navigating constant threats as well as to Israel’s enemies looking to expose its weaknesses. Previous health issues, include a heart condition Netanyahu insists he is in excellent health. His office releases footage of him touring war zones in full protective gear flanked by military officers, or meeting with defense officials on windswept hilltops in youthful dark shades and puffer jackets. But that image was shattered last year when Netanyahu’s doctors revealed that he had a heart condition, a problem that he had apparently long known about but concealed from the public. A week after a fainting spell, Netanyahu was fitted with a pacemaker to control his heartbeat. Only then did staff at the Sheba Medical Center reveal that Netanyahu has for years experienced a condition that can cause irregular heartbeats. The revelation came as Netanyahu was dealing with massive anti-government protests. The news about a chronic heart problem stoked further anger and distrust during extreme political polarization in Israel. Last year, Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital for what doctors said likely was dehydration. He stayed overnight, prompting his weekly Cabinet meeting to be delayed. Earlier this year, Netanyahu underwent hernia surgery, during which he was under full anesthesia and unconscious. Levin served as acting prime minister during the operation. Recovery can be quick According to Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli leader was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection Wednesday stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate. The infection was treated successfully with antibiotics, but doctors said the surgery was needed in any case. Complications from prostate enlargement are common in men in their 70s and 80s, Dr. Shay Golan, head of the oncology urology service at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, told Israeli Army Radio. Golan spoke in general terms and was not involved in Netanyahu’s care or treatment. He said an enlarged prostate can block proper emptying of the bladder, leading to a build-up of urine that can lead to an infection or other complications. After medicinal treatment, doctors can recommend a procedure to remove the prostate to prevent future blockages, Golan said. In Netanyahu’s case, because the prostate is not cancerous, Golan said doctors were likely performing an endoscopic surgery, carried out by inserting small instruments into a body cavity, rather than making surgical cuts in the abdomen to reach the prostate. The procedure lasts about an hour, Golan said, and recovery is quick. He said that aside from catheter use for one to three days after the procedure, patients can return to normal activity without significant limitations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-hospital-says-netanyahu-has-undergone-successful-prostate-surgery/7917792.html	2024-12-29T13:40:36-08:00

Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100	Atlanta, Georgia — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100. When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage, 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force, were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-dies-at-100/7917788.html	2024-12-29T13:26:32-08:00	
Syria's de facto leader: Holding elections may take up to 4 years	Cairo — Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in an interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. The comment from Sharaa, who leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, comes as the new government in Damascus has been seeking to reassure its neighbors that it has moved away from its roots in Islamist militancy. The group's lightning campaign ended a 13-year civil war but has left a host of questions about the future of a multi-ethnic country where foreign states including Turkey and Russia have strong and potentially competing interests. While Western powers largely welcomed the end of the Assad family rule in Syria, it remains unclear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move towards democracy. Sharaa said HTS, formerly known as the Nusra Front, would be dissolved at a national dialog conference. When asked about dissolving the group, Sharaa said: 'Of course. A country cannot be run by the mentality of groups and militias.' The group was once affiliated with Islamic State and al-Qaida but has since renounced both and sought to reposition itself as a force for moderation. It has repeatedly vowed to protect minority groups, who fear the new rulers could seek to impose an Islamist government and has warned of attempts to incite sectarian strife. According to Sharaa, the national dialog conference would include wide participation by Syrian society with votes on issues such as dissolving the parliament and the constitution. On the situation in northeastern Syria, Sharaa said there are talks with all parties to resolve remaining disputes including with the U.S.-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 'We reject Syria becoming a platform for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to launch attacks against Turkey,' he said. He said arms should only be under the control of the state, adding that the ministry of defense would welcome those capable of joining the army. In the interview, Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close Assad ally during the long civil war which has military bases in the country, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. Sharaa said this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the status of Russia's military bases would be the subject of negotiations with the new leadership in Damascus. 'It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds, but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision, and interaction with the local side,' he said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA published Sunday. Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head. In response to a question about neighboring states' concerns over Islamist groups, he said: 'We will not work on exporting the revolution. We want to manage the phase with the mentality of the state and not revolution,' he said, reiterating that they are keen on establishing strategic relations with all regional states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-de-facto-leader-holding-elections-may-take-up-to-4-years/7917780.html	2024-12-29T13:17:26-08:00	
Flights temporarily halted at Halifax airport after airplane landing incident	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is investigating an incident involving a plane at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport, which one passenger described as a rough landing that sparked flames. Nikki Valentine, who was on the PAL Airlines flight, said passengers felt a 'massive rumble' upon landing Saturday night. 'The cabin tilted, we saw sparks and then flames and then smoke started getting sucked into the cabin,' Valentine said Sunday. Airport spokesperson Tiffany Chase said an Air Canada Express flight operated by PAL Airlines, arriving from St. John’s, Newfoundland, experienced an incident upon landing at approximately 9:30 p.m. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the Bombardier Q400 plane experienced a 'suspected landing gear issue' after arrival and was unable to reach the terminal. Fitzpatrick said the crew and 73 passengers were off-loaded by bus and nobody on board was injured. Valentine said she is 'especially thankful the pilot was able to get ahold of the situation very fast.' The incident temporarily halted flight activity at the airport. As of Sunday afternoon, Valentine and other passengers were still without the bags they were instructed to leave on the plane. Valentine said she contacted Air Canada, who told her that it could be up to three more days before their bags are returned as the investigation into the incident continues. 'A lot of people have things like house keys or wallets they needed and couldn’t get,' she said. 'It’s all proper procedure, and I’d rather the inconvenience (of missing bags) than if anything bad had happened, of course, but it’s still tough.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/flights-temporarily-halted-at-halifax-airport-after-airplane-landing-incident-/7917781.html	2024-12-29T13:13:52-08:00	
Rubio confident in engaging Beijing as US top diplomat despite sanctions	President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, is a well-known China critic.

Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' battle for No. 1 at holiday box office	Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' winning the three-day weekend over 'Mufasa' by a blue hair. Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while 'Mufasa' brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s 'Mufasa' had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million. It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of 'Wicked' and 'Moana 2,' which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively. The vampire horror 'Nosferatu' also debuted triumphantly. Robert Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama 'Babygirl' with Nicole Kidman; and 'The Fire Inside,' about boxer Claressa Shields. 'Nosferatu' landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting 'The Faculty's' $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. It was a gamble to open 'Nosferatu' on Christmas, when family films or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off, attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters. 'It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,' said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. 'A lot of people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to do.' The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying. The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over $100. 'People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake it up,' Bunnell said. 'You don’t just spoon feed them the same things over and over again.' The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race. 'Babygirl,' an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival. 'The Fire Inside,' from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in 2006 theaters. Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to 'Wicked,' which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits. 'Moana 2' rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically. Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million. 'Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the holidays lined up,' said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst. Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75 billion in domestic box office receipts. That's down about 3.3% from last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11 billion. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, are: 1. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $38 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $37.1 million. 3. 'Nosferatu,' $21.2 million. 4. 'Wicked,' $19.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $18.2 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $11.6 million. 7. 'Babygirl,' $4.4 million. 8. 'Gladiator II,' $4.2 million. 9. 'Homestead,' $3.2 million. 10. 'The Fire Inside,' $2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sonic-3-and-mufasa-battle-for-no-1-at-holiday-box-office/7917744.html	2024-12-29T11:20:20-08:00	
Tourist killed in shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort	Cairo — One tourist was killed and another was injured in a shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort, the environment ministry said in a statement on Sunday without giving the nationalities of those involved. There are sharks in the Red Sea but encounters with them are relatively rare. The ministry said the attack occurred in deep water outside the designated swimming zone near the jetties in northern Marsa Alam, adding that swimming out from the jetties was prohibited and the jetties would be closed for two days from Monday. Marsa Alam is an Egyptian coastal town known for its coral reefs, marine life and beaches. The last similar incident was in June 2023 when a tiger shark killed a Russian national in Hurghada, another coastal city on the Red Sea north of Marsa Alam. Last month a tourist boat capsized in the same area, leaving four dead and seven missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tourist-killed-in-shark-attack-in-egypt-s-marsa-alam-resort-/7917705.html	2024-12-29T10:19:32-08:00	
Croatia holds presidential election with incumbent NATO, EU critic favored	ZAGREB — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection in the Adriatic Sea state, but is unlikely to get an outright majority in the first round of voting Sunday. President Zoran Milanović, who is often compared to Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents, faces seven other contenders, including Dragan Primorac, the candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. The two are expected to face off in the second round on Jan. 12 if no contender gets more than 50% of the vote, according to pre-election polls. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia’s political scene. 'Since the election silence is still on, I just want to call on people to get out and vote. To support me,' Milanović said after he voted Sunday. He predicted there would be a second round in two weeks. Plenković, the prime minister, has sought to portray the vote as one about Croatia’s future in the EU and NATO. He has labeled Milanović 'pro-Russian' and a threat to Croatia’s international standing. 'The difference between him and Milanović is quite simple: Milanović is leading us East, Primorac is leading us West,' he said. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the NATO and European Union support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, though it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanović has also blocked Croatia’s participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'no Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia’s place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. During the election campaign, Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanović as divisive. 'Today is an extremely important day,' Primorac said after casting his ballot. 'Croatia is going forward into the future. Croatia needs unity, Croatia needs its global positioning, and above all Croatia needs peaceful life.' Trailing a distant third in the pre-election polls is Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate. She has focused her election campaign on the economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Sunday’s presidential election is Croatia’s third vote this year, following a snap parliamentary election in April and the European Parliament balloting in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-holds-presidential-election-with-incumbent-nato-eu-critic-favored-/7917676.html	2024-12-29T09:50:57-08:00	
Will New Year's Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?	New york — If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone. A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 'As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?' says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa. Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found. But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way — by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025. There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024. Relaxed New Year's Eve plans for many Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key. 'A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t found anything or things are just really expensive,' she said. 'Party packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.' As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above — say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all. Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland. 'I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is definitely a change,' he said. 'I wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.' Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues. 'Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,' she said. 'I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.' Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025. Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. 'It’s probably a good year to focus on mental health,' he said. Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health. Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: 'Probably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.' Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. 'Mental health is the new one, but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,' she said. She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: 'I don’t know if that’s really a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.' And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do. This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. 'Hockey’s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-new-year-s-eve-be-loud-or-quiet-what-are-the-top-2025-resolutions-ap-norc-poll-has-answers-/7917658.html	2024-12-29T09:14:47-08:00	
Syria's Jewish community can visit one of world's oldest synagogues again	JOBAR, Syria — In this Damascus suburb, the handful of remaining Jews in Syria can again make pilgrimages to one of the world’s oldest synagogues where people from throughout the region once came to pray. Syria’s 13-year civil war left the synagogue partially destroyed. Walls and roofs have collapsed. Some artifacts are missing. A marble sign in Arabic at the gate says it was first built 720 years before Christ. Since insurgents overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in early December, people have been able to safely visit the widely destroyed Jobar suburb that was pounded for years by government forces while in the hands of opposition fighters. Syria was once home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities. Those numbers have shrunk dramatically, especially after the state of Israel was created in 1948. Today, only nine Jews live in Syria, according to the head of the community, almost all older men and women. The community believes that no Syrian Jews will remain in the country in a few years. One of the people visiting the Jobar Synagogue, also known as Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue, on Thursday was gray-haired Bakhour Chamntoub, the head of the community in Syria. 'This synagogue means a lot to us,' the 74-year-old told The Associated Press during his first visit in 15 years. Chamntoub had heard the synagogue was damaged, but he did not expect to see that part of it had been reduced to a pile of debris. 'I am frankly disturbed,' he said. Chamntoub said Jewish people from around the world have been calling him to say they are ready to help rebuild. He had refused to leave Syria during the war, while all 12 of his siblings left. He said he was happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him. Chamntoub said he had been one of the few Jews who openly spoke about his faith, adding that he never faced discrimination. He said other Jews preferred not to speak openly for safety reasons amid the animosity in Syria toward archenemy Israel and fears of being labeled spies or collaborators. The Jewish community in Syria dates to the prophet Elijah’s Damascus sojourn nearly 3,000 years ago. After 1099, when Christian armies conquered Jerusalem in the First Crusade and massacred the city’s Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, some 50,000 Jews reportedly fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of residents. Another wave of Jews later arrived from Europe, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition that began in 1492. The community in Syria numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. In the years surrounding Israel's creation, Syrian Jews faced increased tensions and restrictions. Many emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries. Under the Assad family's 54-year dynasty, Jews in Syria enjoyed freedom in performing religious duties, but community members were prevented from traveling outside the country to prevent them from going to Israel until the early 1990s. Once travel restrictions were lifted after Arab-Israeli peace talks started, many more left. Before Syria’s conflict began in 2011, Chamntoub and other remaining community members came on Saturdays to Jobar for prayers. He recalled Torahs written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, tapestries and carpets. All are gone, likely stolen by looters. Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, recounted how worshipers on Saturdays asked him to turn on the lights or light a candle since Jews are not allowed to do physical labor on the Sabbath. 'It was a beautiful religious place,' Hazroumi said of the synagogue, which at some point during the war was protected by rebels. It and the whole destroyed suburb 'needs to be reconstructed from scratch.' Assad’s forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed tight security, preventing many people from reaching the area. The new rulers of Syria, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have said they will allow members of all religions to perform their religious duties freely. There have been some sectarian attacks but mostly against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. After visiting the synagogue, Chamntoub returned to his home in old Damascus, close to the private Jewish school known as Maimonides that was founded in 1944 but has been closed for decades. Posters in Hebrew remain on the walls. The area is known as the Jewish quarter. Many old homes have doors and windows closed with pieces of metal and a sign in Arabic saying: 'The real estate is closed by the state's Higher Committee for the Affairs of Jews.' As the Jewish community has shrunk, it has also struggled to find kosher food. Chamntoub receives packages of meat from siblings in the U.S. at least once a year via people traveling to Syria. In the past, he went to the chicken market with a Jewish friend who would slaughter them, but the man now can hardly walk. Chamntoub mostly eats vegetarian dishes. Almost every morning, he cooks for himself and a Jewish woman in the area with no remaining relatives in Syria. The woman, 88-year-old Firdos Mallakh, sat on a couch Thursday under two blankets. When asked to greet an AP journalist with 'Shabbat Shalom,' she replied it was not yet time. 'Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday,' she said. Chamntoub, who makes a living as a landlord, asked Mallakh why she had not turned on the gas heater. Mallakh said she did not want to waste gas. Chamntoub hopes that with the fall of Assad, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. In the past, he said, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without permission from the security agencies. 'I am a Jew, and I am proud of it,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917656.html	2024-12-29T09:01:01-08:00

3 die off northern France coast in Channel crossing attempt	Paris — At least three migrants died early Sunday while attempting to cross the English Channel to Britain from northern France, authorities said. The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy's 'Dauphin' helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. 'There were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,' he said during a press conference Sunday. Sunday's tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past days. 'Since Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,' said Billant. 'But crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.' This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. Billant blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. 'These are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,' he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/die-off-northern-france-coast-in-channel-crossing-attempt-/7917566.html	2024-12-29T07:00:18-08:00	
Tornadoes in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves east	Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and Mississippi. The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of Florida and elsewhere. On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. There were 'multiple touchdown points' in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage. There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the state. At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and 13,000, Texas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tornadoes-in-texas-mississippi-kill-2-and-injure-6-as-severe-weather-system-moves-east-/7917548.html	2024-12-29T06:36:28-08:00	
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Russia unintentionally	Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. [...] We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow's responsibility. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan has begun at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-s-president-says-crashed-jetliner-was-shot-down-by-russia-unintentionally-/7917504.html	2024-12-29T05:29:46-08:00	
Gaza captors tortured hostages, including minors, Israeli report says	JERUSALEM — Hostages held in Gaza were subjected to torture, including sexual and psychological abuse, starvation, burns and medical neglect, according to a new report by the Israeli Health Ministry that will be submitted to the United Nations this week. The report is based on interviews with the medical and welfare teams which treated more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages, most of whom were released in late November 2023, in a brief truce between Israel and Hamas. Eight hostages were rescued by the Israeli military. The hostages include more than 30 children and teenagers, a few of whom were found to have been bound, beaten or branded with a heated object, according to the report addressed to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and published late on Saturday. Women reported sexual assault by the captors, including at gunpoint. Men were beaten, starved, branded, held bound in isolation and denied access to a bathroom, the report said. Some were denied treatment for injuries and medical conditions. The report did not identify any of the hostages by name or age, to protect their privacy, but some of the descriptions matched those provided by hostages and staff that treated them in interviews with Reuters and other media and a U.N. report. Hamas has repeatedly denied abuse of the 251 hostages abducted from Israel during its October 7, 2023, assault. About half of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed by Israeli authorities to still be alive. A fresh bid to secure a Gaza ceasefire including a hostage deal has gained momentum in recent weeks, although no breakthrough has been reported as yet. The war began with Hamas' October 2023 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's subsequent campaign against Hamas has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced nearly all of Gaza's population and reduced much of its territory to rubble. Israeli authorities are investigating allegations of abuse against Palestinian detainees arrested during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-captors-tortured-hostages-including-minors-israeli-report-says-/7917461.html	2024-12-29T03:16:45-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday. Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. 'the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.' Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into 'a nuclear military bloc for aggression.' 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It said Kim's speech 'clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively' by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security. KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers. The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim 'fell in love.' But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals. Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-toughest-anti-us-policy-before-trump-takes-office/7917450.html	2024-12-29T02:19:11-08:00	
New Georgian president sworn in; predecessor says he is not legitimate leader	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Mikheil Kavelashvili, a hard-line critic of the West, was sworn in as president of Georgia on Sunday amid a political crisis after the government froze European Union application talks in a move that sparked major protests. Outgoing President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU opponent of the ruling party, said in a defiant speech to supporters outside the presidential palace that she was leaving the residence but that Kavelashvili had no legitimacy as president, which is a mostly ceremonial position. She said: 'I will come out of here and be with you.' 'I am taking legitimacy with me, I am taking the flag with me, I am taking your trust with me,' she added, before walking out of the palace to mingle with her supporters. Zourabichvili says that Kavelashvili was not duly picked, as the lawmakers who chose him were elected in an October parliamentary election that she says was marked by fraud. Georgia's opposition parties support her. The Georgian Dream ruling party and the country's election commission say that the October election was free and fair. The ruling party says Kavelashvili is the duly elected president. The presidential standoff is seen as a watershed moment in Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million that had until recently been regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states. Kavelashvili is a loyalist of Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire ex-prime minister who is widely seen as Georgia’s de facto leader. On Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Ivanishvili, saying he was spearheading Georgia’s current anti-Western and pro-Russian turn. Protesters hold up red cards Kavelashvili, a former professional soccer player who briefly played as a striker for Manchester City, has repeatedly accused Western intelligence agencies of plotting to drive Georgia into war with neighboring Russia. 'The Georgian people have always understood that peace is the main prerequisite for survival and development,' he said after being sworn in on Sunday. Protesters outside parliament held up red cards in a mocking reference to Kavelashvili's athletic career. Georgian Dream got almost 54% of the official vote in October's election. Local and international election monitors have said the vote was marked by violations that could have affected the results. Western countries have called for an investigation. Zourabichvili is backed by the country’s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate until fresh elections are held. The confrontation comes amid a month of protests sparked by Georgian Dream's suspension of EU accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a longstanding national goal of joining the bloc that is written into the country’s constitution. The move touched off widespread anger among Georgians, who polls show are firmly pro-EU, and prompted a police crackdown, with over 400 people, including senior opposition leaders, detained. Zourabichvili has accused Georgian Dream of deliberately sinking Georgia’s EU hopes and instead moving toward Russia, from which Georgia gained independence in 1991. Opposition supporters say that under Zourabichvili, who was elected with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018 before breaking with the party in recent years, the presidency was the only institution in the country not ultimately under the control of ruling party founder Ivanishvili. They say that with the installation of Kavelashvili, Ivanishvili will have total control over Georgia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-georgian-president-sworn-in-predecessor-says-he-is-not-legitimate-leader-/7917441.html	2024-12-29T01:38:33-08:00	
India shows no willingness to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh	India has shown no sign of complying with Bangladesh’s formal request to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from New Delhi. Hasina fled to India during the massive student-led protests of her regime earlier this year. The Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told local reporters earlier this week that the country’s interim government had informed India of their request to send Hasina back for a 'judicial process.' India confirmed receiving the request. 'At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,' said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, on Tuesday. Foreign policy experts in India have hinted that Hasina may not be sent back to Bangladesh so easily. Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, told VOA via WhatsApp that when Hasina was sent to India by the military for her own safety, there were no legal cases against her. This would complicate extradition, he said, because it is a judicial process that requires solid evidence of a crime. 'Moreover, the bilateral extradition treaty has political exception clauses as well as clauses for fair treatment and safety. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, extradition could be denied,' Chakravarty added. Officials belonging to Bangladesh’s acting government said that Hasina committed several major crimes during her 15-year regime to hold onto power. Bangladeshi student activist Nahid Islam, who serves as an adviser to the interim government, told VOA by phone that it is impossible to ensure proper democracy in the country until Hasina goes to trial. Islam went on to recount the events of the July-August protests, where peaceful student demonstrations turned deadly after a violent crackdown from security forces, acting on Hasina’s orders. 'More than 1,000 students and other protesters, and children, were killed during the July-August uprising. Hasina is the main accused in these cases,' he said. 'She must undergo trial in Bangladesh and be held answerable for her actions.' The Dhaka-based International Crime Tribunal, a court of justice that investigates and prosecutes domestic war crimes, has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and her associates. She has been accused of orchestrating a genocide during the 2024 protests, alongside other 'crimes against humanity' throughout her 15-year reign. Student leader Islam said that besides the crimes during the protests this year, Hasina is also responsible for several illegal acts during her regime. 'She led the government that orchestrated thousands of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. She is also accused of a massive level of malpractice during her regime,' Islam told VOA.' Islam said the interim government will ensure justice for all the victims of the student protest mass killings, and other crimes spanning Hasina’s regime. 'We believe it is our responsibility.' Zafar Sobhan, editor at the Bangladeshi English-language daily Dhaka Tribune, said the country’s demand for Hasina’s extradition is not only justified but should be uncontroversial and agreeable to anyone who 'cares about justice.' 'Sheikh Hasina is credibly accused of extremely grave crimes. Apart from being accused in the killings of hundreds during the mass uprising against her misrule in July and August, and of other serious cases of abuse of power, extrajudicial killing, disappearances, as well as massive corruption and looting of the public exchequer during her rule,' Sobhan told VOA by email. Sobhan said Hasina must stand trial to send the message that no one is above the law, even when in power. 'Rulers need to know that there will be accountability for their misdeeds, otherwise Bangladesh will continue to suffer misrule,' he said. Sheikh Hasina, who has been staying around New Delhi reportedly at a residence provided by the Indian government, has not made any comment after Bangladesh sought her extradition from India. But a senior leader of Hasina’s Awami League party said that the charges against the ousted PM were 'baseless.' 'The allegations of human rights violations, including enforced disappearance and extrajudicial killings, and other so-called malpractices during the regime of [former] Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are nothing but baseless propaganda. Since August 5 a long time has passed by but they have not been able to raise or prove any specific allegations against her or her government,' Sofioul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, organizing secretary of Hasina’s party, told VOA by text over WhatsApp. Former Bangladeshi diplomat Khalilur Rahman said that it is irrefutable that Hasina committed 'heinous crimes' that the world watched unfold in real time. He added that Bangladesh will hold her accountable, as they are obligated to follow the directions of the tribunal. 'We hope the Indian government will cooperate. Care should be taken to observe the extradition treaty between our two countries,' Rahman told VOA by text over WhatsApp. He is the senior representative of the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who leads Bangladesh’s interim government. Student leader Islam added that the interim government would take recourse through all legal and diplomatic means to bring Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial. 'India should cooperate in the process of the democratic transition in Bangladesh by extraditing Sheikh Hasina for trial in our country. That way we ... the two countries ... can bolster our diplomatic relationship,' Islam said. 'India will side with fascism, and stand against democratization in Bangladesh, if it does not extradite Hasina,' he added. Jon Danilowicz, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said that it is worthwhile for Bangladesh to pursue the request even if India refuses to extradite Hasina. 'This will serve as a constant reminder that Bangladesh will continue to seek justice. For its part, India will need to choose whether it stands with the Bangladeshi people or with the deposed dictator. Similarly, Bangladesh should press India to return Hasina’s henchmen who have also sought refuge across the border,' Danilowicz told VOA. 'India’s unwillingness to return these fugitives will be much more difficult to defend as it tries to position itself as a great power,' Danilowicz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-shows-no-willingness-to-extradite-sheikh-hasina-to-bangladesh/7917429.html	2024-12-29T00:37:07-08:00	
AI technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities	For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as 'rineanswsaurs' or sarcastic as 'srkastik.' The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension. 'I just assumed I was stupid,' she recalled of her early grade school years. But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her. 'I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them,' she said. New tech; countless possibilities Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities. There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including those with disabilities — are still learning. Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural. 'I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a cheat code in a video game,' said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: 'We're meeting students where they are.' Programs fortify classroom lessons Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. 'Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense,' he said. 'So if I plug that problem into AI, it'll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that.' He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. 'That's just cheating,' Ben said. Schools weigh pros, cons Schools have been trying to balance the technology's benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can't do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools. But the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices. 'There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That's always going to happen,' Sanft said. 'But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before.' Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient — about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state's education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes. Educators anticipate more tools The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing. 'We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children's handwriting, we fail very badly,' said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn't as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment. Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible. Mother sees potential Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. But Makenzie's mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own. 'Now we don't need to wait anymore,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-technology-helps-level-playing-field-for-students-with-disabilities/7916766.html	2024-12-28T23:22:58-08:00	
What is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?	The Native American Church is considered the most widespread religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for millennia. It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S. laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized Native American tribes to use the substance and don't apply to the broader group of Indigenous people in the United States. The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and 400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit. Why was the Native American Church incorporated? The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S. government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918. In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church, said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of North America. In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with several churches bringing Jesus Christ's name and image into the church so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore, who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. 'Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus, a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs,' he said. 'That probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in the process of transformation to Christianity.' This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way of Life Coalition. In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and set them on fire. 'I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green peyote that didn't burn,' he said, adding that it took decades of lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes to use peyote for religious purposes. How is peyote used in the Native American Church? Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual contemplation. Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine. 'When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up,' he said. 'Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don't drink it like regular tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take medicine.' Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: 'If you take care of the peyote, it will take care of you.' 'And if you believe in it, it will heal you,' he said, adding that he has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments. People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as God's spirit, Red Cloud said. 'Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and it opens the spiritual eye,' he said. 'From there, we start to see where the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine and give thanks to the Creator.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---what-is-the-native-american-church-and-why-is-peyote-sacred-to-members-/7915544.html	2024-12-28T23:22:25-08:00	
Virginia zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends	richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9 following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father, Corwin. One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo said. 'Most people don't get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we feel lucky to have received two over the years,' zoo officials said in a news release Tuesday. Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed 6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up to 270 kilograms. According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild. Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. 'For this reason, once Iris' two previous calves grew up, they were moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and continue contributing to the conservation of their species,' the news release said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-zoo-welcomes-newborn-pygmy-hippopotamus-as-year-ends/7915527.html	2024-12-28T23:21:49-08:00	
Elaborate holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way	CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music, drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn't been diminished by real estate turnover. Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. 'Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays and put it into a full circle,' she said. 'There's not somebody that's going to walk down the street and not feel included.' In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. 'She started crying and said, 'But this is the Christmas street! I want to live there!' ' he said. 'She got her way. We live here, we love it. All the neighbors bond together.' In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily spot the Miranda family's elaborate holiday light display featuring images and music from the movie 'Wicked.' Spotlights reminiscent of movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch's face takes shape across a towering tree. 'It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you can really do the drama with the lights,' said Elisabeth Miranda, who handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation. 'It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it needs to do at the right time.' The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge in traffic after being featured on ABC's 'The Great Christmas Light Fight.' While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal Order of Police. 'They give so much back to our community, so that's our little way of saying thank you to them for everything they do for us,' Miranda said. Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000 pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless people. Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. 'People are looking for joy,' Walters said. 'Our world is a tough place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of love and happiness — it's peaceful. We've never had one problem here at all. Everyone's been highly respectful of our home and full of gratitude.' Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000 people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. 'We bring joy to a lot of people,' he said. 'They walk around and they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/elaborate-holiday-light-displays-are-making-spirits-bright-in-a-big-way/7914333.html	2024-12-28T23:21:17-08:00	
Mexican prison board game brings together people from all walks of life	MEXICO CITY — On a Sunday afternoon in Mexico City's Roma neighborhood, Rosa María Espinosa joins nearly 80 men under a park pavilion to play poleana, a board game requiring mental dexterity that was born in the city's prisons nearly a century ago. Espinosa blows smoke rings with her cigarette and laughs with the others. Today she will be the only woman playing. Though the game's origins still carry a stigma, it is having a moment as people from diverse backgrounds discover its appeal. 'It's a lot of adrenaline,' said Espinosa. 'But sometimes the dice aren't lucky.' Playing for freedom Poleana is played on a square wooden box with a sunken center for dice rolling. Four players, each with four pieces, race to navigate the board, using specific dice combinations and calculations to move their pieces from their starting positions, around the board, and out through their designated corner, while strategically blocking opponents. The board symbolizes the confines of prison, and getting out before the others, winning freedom — even if just metaphorically — is the game's goal. 'People used to say 'these folks know how to play because they've been to prison,'' said the 62-year-old Espinosa. 'Thank God I've never been, but I like to play.' This afternoon's tournament marks the first time she's competed against anyone outside her circle of relatives or friends she usually plays with on Tuesdays and Sundays in the small chapel of her apartment complex. Ancient roots Alejandro Olmos, an archaeologist and anthropologist specializing in Mesoamerican games at the National Anthropology and History School, has studied and played poleana for years. He traces the game's origins to the Indian game chaupar (or pachisi), with archaeological evidence dating back to 600 A.D. After British colonization, the game spread to various Western countries under different names, including Ludo, Aggravation and Parcheesi. In the United States, game maker Parker Brothers marketed a similar game, which was based on the 1913 novel by Eleanor H. Porter Pollyanna. Sometime around 1940, the game spread in the lockups of Mexico City, with Lecumberri—a prison whose very architecture echoed the geometry of the poleana board — likely serving as its initial breeding ground. It was here where it was renamed poleana and received a new set of rules. 'All cultures have a process called adoption-transformation,' Olmos said. In Mexico, 'the game reflects the roughness of prison life: mistakes are not pardoned.' Poleana breaks out Six years ago, Jonathan Rulleri started a family business promoting poleana with the goal of bringing together people from different walks of life. One of the early challenges was establishing common rules for the game, 'which has been spreading from below, from prison to the street and from the street into neighborhoods,' said the 37-year-old Rulleri, who learned to play while incarcerated in the State of Mexico, outside the capital. After his release, he struggled to find work, a common problem for those who have been imprisoned. He launched a taco delivery service alongside his wife, but the business proved unsuccessful, leading him to reluctantly accept a commission to craft a poleana board for an acquaintance. Then came another commission — and he began to post his creations on social media. 'We dumped the taco idea and started making poleanas,' said Rulleri. The resulting business, Poleana Cana'da Frogs — a name derived from a slang word for prison and a description of the way the pieces hop around the board — has so far organized 55 poleana tournaments in public spaces, emphasizing a family-friendly atmosphere and explicitly excluding betting, a practice common in other poleana events. 'We want to remove the game's stigma, that it was a game for prisoners or slackers,' Rulleri said. In the 1980s, the game began to spread beyond the prisons and found purchase in many of Mexico City's rougher neighborhoods. Tepito — the capital's cradle of street commerce and boxing — is one of the neighborhoods where people can almost always be found playing poleana. At a handball court where men of all ages smack a ball against a wall, others on the sidelines play poleana late into the evening. Fernando Rojas, 57, learned poleana when he was 18, but it was in prison where he honed his talents. The games, which can last for hours, in prison happen back-to-back. 'It really helps you escape the reality of being a prisoner and that's how it started,' Rojas said. 'No one can understand what it's like to be a prisoner … you don't see the end of your sentence. There are people who have to do drugs as their way to escape. Poleana is very important in prison.' Now the game serves as Rojas' therapy: a way to relieve stress and avoid family conflict. He carries his dice and pieces in a small plastic bag, religiously joining his friends at the handball court to play. 'We all have problems, in prison and in the street,' he said. 'So a lot of people come here for a distraction.' In Poleana, plays and number combinations have names. For example, a roll of six is a 'six pack,' because that's what it looks like when seen from above. Rolling doubles prompts celebratory shouts of 'pares y no pares,' a play on Spanish words for pairs and not stopping. With luck, you could get a piece three-quarters of the way around the board. While chance plays a role, mathematical calculation is also key. That's why Diego González and Dana López are thrilled that their 7-year-old son Kevin is learning to play poleana. He has fun and he's getting faster with his calculations. González, 33, also makes poleana boards through his family business, Poleanas Iztapalapa, finding a creative outlet after serving a three-year sentence a decade ago. He crafts personalized boards with details like strobe lights and Bluetooth speakers. His boards are popular gifts for weddings, birthdays and Christmas. Some special commissions have included requests to include images of deceased loved ones in the sunken area where dice are tossed. Others want playful characters to decorate boards they give to their children. Sales surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were shut in their homes and found poleana to be a good way to pass the time. 'Two, three hours counting and tossing, and all that was really nice for them,' he said. 'They realized it's not a bad game, it's a game of strategy and getting the family together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-prison-board-game-brings-together-people-from-all-walks-of-life-/7914327.html	2024-12-28T23:20:45-08:00	
Abortions more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel	Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet. It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans. The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Here's a look at data on where things stand: Abortions are more common than before Dobbs Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the United States. One thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained. There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero. 'Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco. For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want. For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills. Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation. They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute. The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling. But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned. As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access. This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as 'controlled dangerous substances,' and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them. Travel for abortion has increased Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans. A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common. The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans. Abortion funds, which benefitted from 'rage giving' in 2022, helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give. The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a game-changer Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1 enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for them. There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer. While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor. Clinics have opened or expanded in some places The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states. But some states where abortion remains legal until viability – generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have seen clinics open and expand. Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics. There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers. Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even though they might provide few of them. Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients' lives How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned. President Joe Biden's administration said hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho. More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records. Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. 'It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,' Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortions-more-common-in-us-as-women-turn-to-pills-travel-/7917395.html	2024-12-28T18:45:35-08:00	
Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Iran, bracing for the possible re-imposition of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and U.N. economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry. The Iranian rial on Saturday hit a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar amid uncertainty about Trump's arrival in the White House on Jan. 20. The rial plunged to 820,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market, compared with 808,500 rials on Friday, according to Bonbast.com, which reports exchange rates. The bazar360.com website also said the dollar was being sold for about 820,500 rials. Also facing an inflation rate officially put at about 35%, Iranians seeking to shelter their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies. The rial has dropped about 18% in total since Trump was elected in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-2025-important-year-for-nuclear-issue/7917392.html	2024-12-28T17:24:42-08:00	
Plane crashes at airport in South Korea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — An aircraft drove off the runway and crashed at Muan International Airport in South Korea, with 23 casualties confirmed, the Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday. The Jeju Air plane, which was carrying 175 passengers and six flight attendants, was flying back from Thailand and the accident took place while it was landing, the report said. The airport is in southern South Korea. Photos shared by local media showed smoke coming out of the plane. One person was found alive as the rescue mission was continuing, according to Yonhap. The news agency did not immediately give details on the casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-at-airport-in-south-korea-/7917391.html	2024-12-28T17:18:48-08:00	
UK to tax private schools in $1.9 B boost to public education	LONDON — The U.K. will end a tax exemption for private schools Wednesday, the center-left Labour government has announced, in a move set to raise over £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) for public education. After years of worsening educational inequalities, from Jan. 1, private schools will have to pay 20% value added tax on tuition fees, which will be used to fund thousands of new teachers and improve standards in state schools. 'It's time things are done differently,' finance minister Rachel Reeves said in a statement Sunday. The funding will 'go towards our state schools where 94% of this country's children are educated,' she said. The policy was promised by Labour in its election campaign and officially laid out in its inaugural budget in October. It hopes the move will bring in $1.9 billion for the 2025-2026 school year and rise to $2.1 billion a year by 2029-30, which will be used to fund 6,500 new teachers in the public sector. Tuition fees in private schools already average $22,600 a year, according to the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools. That figure is set to rise, with the government estimating that tuition fees will increase by around 10%, with schools taking on part of the additional cost. 'High and rising standards cannot just be for families who can afford them,' said education secretary Bridget Phillipson. Opponents of the reform say state school enrolment will explode if the private sector is lost, increasing the cost to the government. But studies contradict this. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the number of children in state schools will actually fall by 2030 due to a projected population decline. Several research centers also point out that the disparity between private and state schools widened sharply under the 14-year Conservative rule. The Labour government won a landslide election in July promising to boost economic growth and improve public services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-tax-private-schools-in-1-9-b-boost-to-public-education/7917387.html	2024-12-28T17:10:28-08:00	
North Korea launches 'toughest' US strategy during key party meeting	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key policy-setting meeting of the country's ruling party last week ahead of the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. The meeting of party and government officials decided that North Korea would launch the 'toughest' strategy to counteract the United States for its security and national interests, the report said, without elaborating. The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to a 'nuclear military bloc' and South Korea has become an 'anti-communist outpost' for the U.S., the KCNA report added. 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' it said. The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with 'friendly' countries during the meeting. Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to bolster the country's war deterrence. Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful Politburo of the party's Central Committee. The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a mutual defense pledge. Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries' military cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-declares-strongest-us-strategy-in-key-party-meeting-/7917386.html	2024-12-28T16:58:26-08:00	
Storms delay, cancel thousands of flights across US	Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the country. More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday, according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were canceled. About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, were delayed. At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement said. 'Those numbers will probably go up,' said forecaster Aaron Gleason, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain before New Year's Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located on the border of California and Nevada. 'Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,' the Weather Service warned. 'Widespread power outages are possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/storms-delay-cancel-thousands-of-flights-across-us-/7917383.html	2024-12-28T16:37:54-08:00	
Belarus' leader pardons 20 more prisoners; rights groups say repression continues	TALLINN, ESTONIA — Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 more people that rights activists describe as political prisoners, a statement on the president's website said Saturday. The announcement came amid persistent oppression in the run-up to presidential elections next month that are likely to extend Lukashenko's decadeslong rule. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released, but the statement posted on the website of the president said that all of them had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature.' The statement said the group included 11 women and 14 of those pardoned suffered from chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement, using wording familiar from a series of previous group pardons in the past six months. Saturday's announcement marks the eighth such pardon by Lukashenko since the summer of 2024. In all, 207 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarus' oldest and most established human rights group, Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. According to Viasna, over 1,250 political prisoners remain behind bars. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not been heard from for months on end, have been released. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Viasna founder Ales Bialiatski; Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote; and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression, said Viasna activist Pavel Sapelka, as Minsk prepares to hold new presidential elections in January 2025 that are likely to hand Lukashenko a seventh term in office. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals (to the West), pardoning some but jailing twice as many political prisoners in their place,' Sapelka said. 'Repression is intensifying, and authorities are trying to root out any signs of dissent before the January elections.' Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-leader-pardons-20-more-prisoners-rights-groups-say-repression-continues-/7917380.html	2024-12-28T16:19:32-08:00	
Olivia Hussey, star of the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' dies at 73	LONDON — Olivia Hussey, the actor who starred as a teenage Juliet in the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' has died, her family said on social media Saturday. She was 73. Hussey died on Friday, 'peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones,' a statement posted to her Instagram account said. Hussey was 15 when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her in his adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy after spotting her onstage in the play 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' which also starred Vanessa Redgrave. 'Romeo and Juliet' won two Oscars and Hussey won a Golden Globe for best new actress for her part as Juliet, opposite British actor Leonard Whiting, who was 16 at the time. Decades later, Hussey and Whiting brought a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud over nude scenes in the film. They alleged that they were initially told they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in a bedroom scene, but on the day of the shoot Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup, and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity. They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge. The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late. Whiting was among those paying tribute to Hussey on Saturday. 'Rest now my beautiful Juliet no injustices can hurt you now. And the world will remember your beauty inside and out forever,' he wrote. Hussey was born on April 17, 1951, in Bueno Aires, Argentina, and moved to London as a child. She studied at the Italia Conti Academy drama school. She also starred as Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the 1977 television series 'Jesus of Nazareth,' as well as in the 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie's 'Death on the Nile' and horror movies 'Black Christmas' and 'Psycho IV: The Beginning.' She is survived by her husband, David Glen Eisley, her three children and a grandson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/olivia-hussey-star-of-the-1968-film-romeo-and-juliet-dies-at-73/7917214.html	2024-12-28T15:28:25-08:00	
DR Congo rebels kill at least 21 in during Christmas week	BENI, DR CONGO — Islamic State group-linked ADF rebels have killed at least 21 people this week in the conflict-riven eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local sources told AFP on Saturday. The attacks all took place close to Manguredjipa, a town known for its rich mineral deposits and regularly targeted by the ADF. On December 21, ADF rebels made an incursion into the village of Robinet, in the Bapere sector of North Kivu province, a local official said. 'They killed six people on the spot, then on December 22 they arrived at the neighboring village we call Kodjo where they killed 12 people,' Macaire Sivikunula, a representative for the Bapere sector's governor, told AFP. Then on Christmas Day, ADF fighters 'arrived seven kilometers from Manguredjipa in the village called Makele and killed three people,' Sivikunula added. Multiple separate local sources confirmed the dates, locations and tolls of these attacks to AFP. Originally from Uganda, the ADF, or Allied Democratic Forces, have been present since the mid-1990s in the DRC's restive northeast, where its fighters have killed thousands of civilians. In 2019, the ADF pledged allegiance to IS. The IS touts them as its Islamic State Central Africa Province and claims responsibility for some of the rebel group's attacks. At the end of 2021, Uganda and the DRC launched a joint military operation against the ADF. That offensive has so far proven unsuccessful in putting an end to the rebel attacks. Both armies have pushed the rebels back into remote and inaccessible areas, where local civilians are often at their mercy. Sivikunula said the Ugandan and Congolese armies were present and at work in Manguredjipa. 'But as the rebels are scattered in small groups of dispersed fighters, it's really difficult to pinpoint their location,' he added. North Kivu province also faces a separate rebel insurgency further south, with the Rwanda-backed M23 movement and the DRC's army locked in fighting all week following the failure of a peace summit in mid-December. Home to vast mineral resources, the eastern DRC has been plagued by infighting between various armed groups for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-rebels-kill-at-least-21-in-during-christmas-week-/7917197.html	2024-12-28T14:28:44-08:00	
Efforts to free reporter held in Iran 'complicated,' says Italy	ROME — Efforts to release Italian journalist Cecilia Sala from prison in Iran are 'complicated,' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Saturday. Sala was detained on December 19 by police in Tehran and is being held in the city's notorious Evin prison, according to her employer. 'We are trying to resolve a complicated issue and to ensure in the meantime that Cecilia Sala is detained in the best possible conditions,' Tajani said. Asked when she might be released, he said 'I hope shortly, but it does not depend on us.' 'She is obviously detained, which is not ideal, but she is fed and in a single cell,' he said. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said she was 'following the complex affair' closely, and Rome was pursuing 'all possible avenues of dialogue' to bring Sala home 'as soon as possible.' Chora Media, an Italian podcast publisher for which Sala worked, said she had traveled from Rome to Iran on December 12 on a journalist visa, and was due to return on December 20. But she went quiet on December 19 and then did not board her flight. Shortly afterwards she called her mother to say she had been arrested, it said.

Turkish FM discusses with Blinken need to cooperate with new Syrian administration	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey's foreign minister discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday the need to act in cooperation with the new Syrian administration to ensure the completion of the transition period in an orderly manner, the ministry said. In a phone call, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken that Ankara would not allow Kurdish YPG militia to take shelter in Syria, the ministry spokesperson said. During the call, Blinken emphasized the need to support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that 'upholds human rights and prioritizes an inclusive and representative government,' according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. Blinken and Fidan also discussed preventing terrorism from endangering the security of Turkey and Syria, the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-fm-discusses-with-blinken-need-to-cooperate-with-new-syrian-administration/7917171.html	2024-12-28T13:33:31-08:00	
Drought, fire, deforestation ravaged Amazon rainforest in 2024	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — 2024 was a brutal year for the Amazon rainforest, with rampant wildfires and extreme drought ravaging large parts of a biome that's a critical counterweight to climate change. A warming climate fed drought that in turn fed the worst year for fires since 2005. And those fires contributed to deforestation, with authorities suspecting some fires were set to more easily clear land to run cattle. The Amazon is twice the size of India and sprawls across eight countries and one territory, storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet. It has about 20% of the world's fresh water and astounding biodiversity, including 16,000 known tree species. But governments have historically viewed it as an area to be exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples, and experts say exploitation by individuals and organized crime is rising at alarming rates. 'The fires and drought experienced in 2024 across the Amazon rainforest could be ominous indicators that we are reaching the long-feared ecological tipping point,' said Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that works to protect the rainforest. 'Humanity's window of opportunity to reverse this trend is shrinking, but still open.' There were some bright spots. The level of Amazonian forest loss fell in both Brazil and Colombia. And nations gathered for the annual United Nations conference on biodiversity agreed to give Indigenous peoples more say in nature conservation decisions. 'If the Amazon rainforest is to avoid the tipping point, Indigenous people will have been a determinant factor,' Miller said. Wildfires and extreme drought Forest loss in Brazil's Amazon — home to the largest swath of this rainforest — dropped 30.6% compared to the previous year, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. The improvement under leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva contrasted with deforestation that hit a 15-year high under Lula's predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. In July, Colombia reported historic lows in deforestation in 2023, driven by a drop in environmental destruction. The country's environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that 2024's figures may not be as promising because a significant rise in deforestation had already been recorded by July due to dry weather caused by El Nino, a weather phenomenon that warms the central Pacific. Illegal economies continue to drive deforestation in the Andean nation. 'It's impossible to overlook the threat posed by organized crime and the economies they control to Amazon conservation,' said Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Illegal gold mining is expanding rapidly, driven by soaring global prices, and the revenues of illicit economies often surpass state budgets allocated to combat them.' In Brazil, large swaths of the rainforest were draped in smoke in August from fires raging across the Amazon, Cerrado savannah, Pantanal wetland and the state of Sao Paulo. Fires are traditionally used for deforestation and for managing pastures, and those man-made blazes were largely responsible for igniting the wildfires. For a second year, the Amazon River fell to desperate lows, leading some countries to declare a state of emergency and distribute food and water to struggling residents. The situation was most critical in Brazil, where one of the Amazon River's main tributaries dropped to its lowest level ever recorded. Cesar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who lives in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, said he believes people are becoming increasingly aware of the Amazon's fundamental role 'for the survival of society as a whole.' But, like Miller, he worries about a 'point of no return of Amazon destruction.' It was the worst year for Amazon fires since 2005, according to nonprofit Rainforest Foundation U.S. Between January and October, an area larger than the state of Iowa — about 15.1 million hectares of Brazil's Amazon — burned. Bolivia had a record number of fires in the first 10 months of the year. 'Forest fires have become a constant, especially in the summer months and require particular attention from the authorities who don't how to deal with or respond to them,' Ipenza said. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Guyana also saw a surge in fires this year. Indigenous voices, rights made headway The United Nations conference on biodiversity — this year known as COP16 — was hosted by Colombia. The meetings put the Amazon in the spotlight and a historic agreement was made to give Indigenous groups more of a voice on nature conservation decisions, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize Indigenous people's role in protecting land and combating climate change. Both Ebus and Miller saw promise in the appointment of Martin von Hildebrand as the new secretary general for the Amazon Treaty Cooperation Organization, announced during COP16. 'As an expert on Amazon communities, he will need to align governments for joint conservation efforts. If the political will is there, international backers will step forward to finance new strategies to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest,' Ebus said. Ebus said Amazon countries need to cooperate more, whether in law enforcement, deploying joint emergency teams to combat forest fires, or providing health care in remote Amazon borderlands. But they need help from the wider world, he said. 'The well-being of the Amazon is a shared global responsibility, as consumer demand worldwide fuels the trade in commodities that finance violence and environmental destruction,' he said. Next year marks a critical moment for the Amazon, as Belem do Para in northern Brazil hosts the first United Nations COP in the region that will focus on climate. 'Leaders from Amazon countries have a chance to showcase strategies and demand tangible support,' Ebus said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-fire-deforestation-ravaged-amazon-rainforest-in-2024/7917162.html	2024-12-28T13:14:49-08:00	
Elon Musk vows 'war' over H-1B visas in rift with Trump supporters	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, vowed to go to 'war' to defend the H-1B visa program for foreign tech workers late Friday amid a dispute between President-elect Donald Trump's longtime supporters and his most recently acquired backers from the tech industry. In a post on social media platform X, Musk said, 'The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.' 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his electric-car company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas this year. H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Musk's tweet was directed at Trump's supporters and immigration hardliners who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas. Trump has so far remained silent on the issue. The Trump transition did not respond to a request for comment on Musk's tweets and the H-1B visa debate. In the past, Trump has expressed a willingness to provide more work visas to skilled workers. He has also promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens, and severely restrict immigration. The issue highlights how tech leaders such as Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base. The U.S. tech industry relies on the government's H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens. The altercation was set off this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued 'big tech oligarchs' for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization. In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration. Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917156.html	2024-12-28T12:40:38-08:00	
Bloodied Ukrainian troops risk losing hard-won land in Kursk to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk, a region some want to hold at all costs while others question the value of having gone in at all. Battles are so intense that some Ukrainian commanders can't evacuate the dead. Communication lags and poorly timed tactics have cost lives, and troops have little way to counterattack, seven frontline soldiers and commanders told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so they could discuss sensitive operations. Since being caught unaware by the lightning Ukrainian incursion, Russia has amassed more than 50,000 troops in the region, including some from its ally North Korea. Precise numbers are hard to obtain, but Moscow's counterattack has killed and wounded thousands and the overstretched Ukrainians have lost more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers of Kursk they seized in August. Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But five Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1,000-kilometer front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. 'We have, as they say, hit a hornet's nest. We have stirred up another hot spot,' said Stepan Lutsiv, a major in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Border raid turned occupation Army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukraine launched the operation because officials thought Russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast Ukraine. It began on August 5 with an order to leave Ukraine's Sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. It became an occupation that Ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gathering his men, one company commander told them: 'We're making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn't been done since World War II. Privately, he was less certain. 'It seemed crazy,' he said. 'I didn't understand why.' Shocked by the success achieved largely because the Russians were caught by surprise, the Ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of Korenevo, 25 kilometers into Russia. That was one of the first places where Russian troops counterattacked. By early November the Russians began regaining territory rapidly. Once in awe of what they accomplished, troops' opinions are now shifting as they come to terms with losses. The company commander said half of his troops were dead or wounded. Some frontline commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low, and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying Kursk. Another commander said that some orders his men have received don't reflect reality because of delays in communication. Delays occur especially when territory is lost to Russian troops, he said. 'They don't understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what's under our control, and what isn't,' he said. 'They don't understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion.' One platoon commander said higher-ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit's defensive position because he knows his men can't hold the line. 'Those people who stand until the end are ending up MIA,' he said. He said he also knows of at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties. Russia doubles down Ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive Russian response in Kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back. 'There's no other option. We'll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won't stop; they'll keep advancing,' said one drone unit commander. Ukraine's General Staff told The Associated Press in a written response to questions that Ukrainian combat units are inflicting losses to Russian personnel and military equipment on a daily basis, and they are provided with 'everything necessary' to carry out combat duties. 'Troops are managed in accordance to situational awareness and operational information, taking into the account the operational situation in areas where tasks are performed,' the response said. American longer-range weapons have slowed the Russian advance and North Korean soldiers who joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, Ukrainian troops said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. But they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines. One clash took place last week near Vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of Kremenne and Vorontsovo. Until last week, the area was under Ukraine's control. This week part of it has been lost to Russian forces and Ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route. Eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the Donbas — where Russia is closing on a crucial supply hub — some soldiers are more vocal about whether Kursk has been worth it. 'All the military can think about now is that Donbas has simply been sold,' the platoon commander said. 'At what price?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bloodied-ukrainian-troops-risk-losing-more-hard-won-land-in-kursk-to-russia/7917149.html	2024-12-28T12:23:31-08:00	
Afghan forces target Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes	Afghanistan's Taliban Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces hit several points inside Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes last week. Pakistan last Tuesday launched an operation to destroy a training facility and kill insurgents in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province. The strikes killed dozens of people, mostly women and children. Comments from the Taliban Defense Ministry on Saturday, posted on social media platform X, said its forces targeted Pakistani points that 'served as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' Ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khwarzami gave no further information about the strikes, including how they were carried out and if there were any casualties on either side. However, a pro-Taliban media outlet, Hurriyet Daily News, cited ministry sources as saying that the strikes killed 19 Pakistani troops and three Afghan civilians. No one from Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry was immediately available for comment. People celebrated Afghanistan's retaliation in the country's southeastern Khost province, according to the organizer, Rasheedullah Hamdard. Thousands turned out to show their happiness and assure the Afghan military of their support against Pakistan. Khost neighbors Paktika, which was targeted last week. 'All of them were chanting angry slogans against this action by Pakistan, such as ‘death to Pakistan,’' Hamdard said. 'All Afghans are brothers, so it is necessary that the nation and government show their pride in their blood.' Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat cross-border militant activity, a charge the Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country from Afghan soil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-forces-target-pakistan-in-retaliation-for-deadly-airstrikes/7917118.html	2024-12-28T10:52:40-08:00	
Assad’s fall opens new dynamics in Middle East, regional analysts say	AMMAN, JORDAN — The overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime has opened the door to new dynamics in the Middle East, regional analysts say, with Turkey likely gaining superiority, Iran reeling and, with that, Iraq gaining more freedom from Iranian pressure. The Assad government in Syria spanned 54 years in power — first with the elder Hafez al-Assad and later with son Bashar of the minority Alawite community, a branch of Shiite Islam. Regional analysts say its fall marks a seismic shift in Middle East politics. Sinan Ulgen, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe speaking during a Carnegie Middle East Center webinar on Dec. 19 in Beirut, called it a 'political earthquake' with far-reaching regional implications. 'Fundamentally, we now see the emergence of a government in Syria that maybe after 50 years really is likely to be more pro-Turkey than pro-Iran,' Ulgen said. 'This is a lasting change in the regional power constellation, which is another reason why the fall of Assad has been welcomed with such zeal in Ankara,' the capital of Turkey. Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of the Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel’s attacks on Iran’s assets in Syria and its Hezbollah proxies in neighboring Lebanon, as well as Israeli military strikes in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran, 'present a moment of regional reckoning' for Iran. 'It [Iran] is definitely on the backfoot,' she said. 'There is now a strategic rethink ... happening in the establishment about where their policies — both at home and abroad — go from here.' Geranmayeh said prominent figures in Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps are likely to be replaced with others, given the nation’s demoted regional status and the near demise of its so-called axis of resistance in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. She said that Iran likely will spin a narrative that the late Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani’s regional project to surround Israel with a so-called ring of fire has been 'accomplished,' and that Iran will look to devise other plans to deal with the new reality it faces. Harith Hasan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said, 'Iraq is the last stronghold for Iran’s axis of resistance,' but that, too, could be changing. 'So, Iran might try to strongly defend that influence,' Hasan said. 'But as we see, the balance of power has shifted a lot, and the Iraqi government gained more freedom to be able to resist some of the pressure coming from Tehran.' Hasan said concerns about a possible Islamist-led government in Syria is giving cause for concern to its neighbors, as well as to regional political influencers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That, he said, 'could give Iraq new leverage' because of its long border with Syria and strong cross-border ties between the two countries. Hasan said that also may give Iraq a way out from under Iran’s influence, as developments in the region continue to unfold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-fall-opens-new-dynamics-in-middle-east-regional-analysts-say/7917110.html	2024-12-28T10:42:48-08:00

Russia to stop gas exports to Moldova beginning Jan. 1	MOSCOW / CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — Russian energy giant Gazprom said Saturday it would suspend gas exports to Moldova from 0500 GMT on Jan. 1 due to unpaid debt by Moldova, which is bracing for severe power cuts. It said the company reserved the right to take any action, including terminating the supply contract with Moldova. Russia supplies Moldova with about 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year, which is piped via Ukraine to the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where it is used to generate cheap power that is sold to government-controlled parts of Moldova. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean condemned the Russian decision, which is a precursor to a total shutdown of Russian gas exports via Ukraine and to Europe, where it flows farther to Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Italy, once a current transit deal with Ukraine expires on Dec. 31. Moldova will be hit the hardest by the shutdown. 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transdniestrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' Recean wrote on Facebook, accusing Russia of using energy as a political weapon. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed those allegations. Difference over debt Russia, which is critical of Moldova's West-leaning central government, has said Moldova should pay a debt on past supplies. According to Russian calculations, the debt stands at $709 million. Moldova has put the debt at $8.6 million. Gazprom has said previously it wants Moldova to pay the debt before it starts to pump gas to the country via alternate routes. Transdniestria and the government in Chisinau agreed in 2022 that all Russian gas received by Moldova would flow to the breakaway region, which traditionally does not pay for fuel. Without gas supplies, the power-generating plant could stop working and Moldova and Transdniestria would face hourslong blackouts like those experienced by Ukraine due to Russia's attacks on its energy infrastructure in their war. Recean said Moldova had diversified sources of gas supply 'in order to reduce dependence on a single supplier.' 'Our country is prepared to handle any situation that arises following the Kremlin's decision,' he said. Moldova's population of 2.5 million has been preparing for long power cuts since Ukraine's government said it will not extend its transit contract with Gazprom. Moldova and Transdniestria have declared states of emergency over the threat of disrupted gas supplies, and Moldova said Friday it will curb power exports and introduce measures to reduce consumption by at least a third beginning Jan. 1. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has accused Gazprom of provoking an energy crisis, saying it was refusing to supply gas through an alternate route.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-stop-gas-exports-to-moldova-beginning-jan-1/7917083.html	2024-12-28T10:13:58-08:00	
Sweden searches for more cemetery space in case of war	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN — Burial associations in Sweden are looking to acquire enough land for something they hope they'll never have to do: bury thousands of people in the event of war. The search follows recommendations from the Church of Sweden’s national secretariat, which reflect crisis preparedness guidelines from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the Swedish Armed Forces. The preparedness guidelines have been put in a new light by Sweden's decision to join NATO and tensions with Russia in the Baltic Sea region. According to the Church of Sweden provisions, supported by legal paragraphs in Sweden’s Burial Act, burial associations are responsible for ensuring the availability of enough land to bury roughly 5% of the population within a parish, if needed. The Goteborg Burial Association, which operates in Sweden’s second-largest city, is currently trying to navigate the challenge of acquiring at least 40,470 square meters (about 10 acres) of land to ensure it can handle urgent casket burials for some 30,000 dead in case of war. That is in addition to another 60,700 square meters (about 15 acres) of land needed for building graveyards for regular use in Goteborg. 'The [recommendations] mean that we need more land for burial grounds and this is a phenomenon in the big cities, and a problem in the big cities, where land resources are scarce to begin with and not always sufficient to meet burial-ground needs even in times of calm and peace,' said Katarina Evenseth, senior adviser at the Goteborg Burial Association. Together with the local municipality, which has a monopoly in making decisions about land usage in Goteborg, the burial association has identified a vast area appropriate for building a large-scale cemetery for the intended purpose. But a lengthy approval and building process means it could take approximately 10 years to complete, posing further challenges in uncertain times. Meanwhile, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, or MSB, continues to stress the importance of crisis preparedness and highlights the efforts of the Church of Sweden. 'Already back in 2015 the Government assigned various authorities to once again start engaging in civil defense planning, and many organizations have started planning, with the Church of Sweden being at the forefront of that planning,' said Jan-Olof Olsson, critical infrastructure protection expert at MSB. 'Unfortunately, it is the case that we are reminded to a greater degree that war could happen and that we simply need to be prepared for that,' Olsson said. Sweden pursued a policy of neutrality from the early 19th century, including during World War II. But public opinion shifted sharply in 2022 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to Sweden and Finland applying to join the transatlantic alliance out of concern about the threat from their newly aggressive Russian neighbor across the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Finland sent out updated civil preparedness guides in November with instructions on how to survive in war. The guides are like those in Denmark and Norway, although they don't mention Russia by name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-searches-for-more-cemetery-space-in-case-of-war/7917072.html	2024-12-28T10:01:45-08:00	
Extremist groups harass Kashmiri vendors in northern India	SRINAGAR, INDIAN-ADMINISTERED KASHMIR — Nomadic shawl vendors from the Indian side of Kashmir told VOA Friday that extremist Hindu groups have been harassing, threatening and obstructing them from selling their goods in Himachal Pradesh, a northern Indian state. Hindu groups claim that the local shopkeepers lose business when nomadic vendors sell their wares nearby. Sandeep Dhawal, police superintendent in the Bilaspur district, quoted in Friday’s edition of the Indian Express, a leading Indian newspaper, acknowledged that more than a dozen shawl vendors filed a complaint at the Ghumarwin police station. Dhawal said a similar dispute arose last year between Kashmiri hawkers and local shopkeepers, who claimed financial losses because of the vendors. 'No physical assault has been reported,' he told the Indian Express. 'We have requested the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Bilaspur to mediate and resolve the issue amicably. A meeting between both parties is expected within the next day or two.' The Indian Express reported that senior officials attributed the harassment claims to 'business rivalry' between the Kashmiri vendors and local shopkeepers affiliated with the Ghumarwin Beopar Mandal. A police investigation is under way. The traders said they have been visiting the region for more than 30 years but are facing threats and pressure this year to leave the state, where they stay for a few months annually. Kashmir vendors sell leather jackets, socks, bags and Kashmir-handmade Pashmina shawls. They also sell ladies suits. They move to different states of India to sell these items in the beginning of November and return after March. They carry their goods on their shoulders and sell them anywhere they find customers. 'For the past three days we have been forced by some Hindu extremist groups to stop selling our goods. They tell us to pack up our belongings and go back to Kashmir,' a trader currently residing in the Ghumarwin area of Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, said to VOA on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. 'These threats and intimidations used to happen occasionally, but this year when we go to the market to purchase food and other essentials, we are mistreated there as well,' he said. He noted it has become difficult for them to even 'step out' of their rented accommodations. The trader said he and his fellow vendors asked the Hindu groups whether they considered Kashmiris less Indian. 'We also told them, ‘If people from other parts of India can work in Kashmir, then why we can’t work here?’' the trader said. 'Instead of apologizing, they threatened us with dire consequences if we don’t leave Himachal Pradesh. They also accused us of being anti-nationals and terror sympathizers.' Thousands of Kashmiris travel every winter to various Indian states to sell handmade goods such as shawls, suits and leather jackets door-to-door or street-to-street. They say they sometimes face difficulties — verbal abuse, physical assault and boycott calls — because of their regional identity and the growing communal tensions in India. The traders say such incidents were rare before 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came to power. 'Before 2014, only an insane person would make such statements or resort to violence, but today it has become common,' Peerzada Mohammad Shafi Shah, a leather jacket vendor, told VOA from Salt Lake City, West Bengal. 'Muslims, particularly Kashmiris, are seen as enemies in almost every part of India. There are three to four states where communalism is so high that the majority of Kashmiris have stopped going there,' Shah said. 'Had the government of Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, taken action in the beginning, things could have been much better.' The traders in Himachal Pradesh claimed people affiliated with Hindu extremist groups have threatened them and the owners of buildings where they stay, either individually or in groups. 'We are being warned that they are being polite now, and if we do not comply, they will return and their language will be different,' another Kashmiri shawl seller told VOA, on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety. 'No one else has issues with us except them. They give absurd reasons, like claiming that local shopkeepers in Himachal Pradesh suffer because of us, even though their line of work is entirely different from ours,' he said. Maqsood Khan, one of the traders, said that following the police complaint, the deputy superintendent of the Ghumarwin police department visited them. He said the police officer spoke with representatives on both sides of the disagreement and instructed the accused persons not to harass the Kashmiri traders. 'The deputy superintendent of police told the opposing party that we, too, have the right to sell our products, just like the local shopkeepers in the area,' he said. 'This has eased temporarily,' but the situation will be remedied 'only after the representatives of both sides will express each other’s concerns in front of [the] deputy commissioner.' Meanwhile, Ifra Jan, the spokesperson of J&K’s ruling party, National Conference, told VOA by phone the lives and security of Kashmiri traders across India is crucial to her party. 'When we got to know about the harassment case, when these people were mishandled and abused and threatened, the Chief Minister of J&K Omar Abdullah immediately got in touch with chief minister of Himachal Pradesh,' Jan said. 'The Himachal Pradesh government has now taken cognizance of the matter, and his office is ensuring a safe and secure environment for the Kashmiri traders and students living there.' VOA contacted the Ghumarwin police department about the latest developments in the situation, although officers there said only higher officials can speak about the matter, and they were not available for comment. Earlier in November, a female official from a Panchayat, a local self-government body in Indian villages, told Kashmiri shawl sellers not to trade in Himachal Pradesh. In a video, she told them to leave the village and chanted 'hail Lord Ram' — one of the revered deities in Hinduism. She later apologized for those comments after being summoned to the Himachal Pradesh police station. 'We want to put an end to this unwanted controversy and live happily and peacefully alongside [our] Hindu brethren in the state,' Khan the trader said.

Trump energy plans complicated by tariffs, global competition	A different approach to energy is at the center of President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to bring down the cost of living for Americans. But as VOA’s Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson reports, Trump’s plans could be complicated by a complex global interdependence on oil and gas supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-energy-plans-complicated-by-tariffs-global-competition/7916993.html	2024-12-28T08:10:49-08:00	
Putin apologizes to Azerbaijan for 'tragic incident' of plane crash	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday apologized to his Azerbaijani counterpart for what he called a 'tragic incident' following the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner in Kazakhstan that killed 38 people. The Kremlin said in a statement that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, due to a Ukrainian drone strike as the plane attempted to land Wednesday. It stopped short of saying the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin apologized to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev 'for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace.' The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan and crashed while trying to land. There were 29 survivors. On Friday, a U.S. official and an Azerbaijani minister made separate statements blaming the crash on an external weapon. Friday’s assessments by Rashan Nabiyev and White House national security spokesperson John Kirby echoed those made by outside aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defense systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. Neither Kirby nor the Azerbaijani minister directly addressed the statements blaming air defenses. Kirby told reporters Friday that the U.S. has 'seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems,' but he refused to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. Nabiyev, Azerbaijan’s minister of digital development and transportation, told Azerbaijani media that 'preliminary conclusions by experts point to external impact,' as does witness testimony. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea. He didn’t comment on statements from some aviation experts who pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems. Earlier this week, Rosaviatsia cited unspecified early evidence as showing that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. In the days following the crash, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed 'physical and technical interference' and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didn’t say where the interference came from or provide any further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-apologizes-to-azerbaijan-for-tragic-incident-of-plane-crash/7916971.html	2024-12-28T07:23:21-08:00	
South Africa reroutes Mozambique trade, travel to Eswatini border amid violence	MBABANE, ESWATINI — As Mozambique grapples with a political crisis following a disputed national election and violent protests, the situation at its southern border with South Africa is increasingly volatile, affecting trade and travel. The violence in Mozambique forced trade and travel to be diverted from South Africa’s Leebombo Border Post to Eswatini’s Mananga Border Post, with Mananga serving as a makeshift lifeline for those seeking passage from Mozambique. Michael Masiapato, commissioner of South Africa’s Border Management Authority, told VOA that although authorities are managing the crisis, it continues to pose significant challenges. 'Even ... when they deploy the military and when they deploy police officers on the corridor [between the capital, Maputo, and the border], it is not able to cover each and every area,' he said. The protests, he said, are 'very much sporadic' and 'very much widespread.' Following presidential candidate Daniel Chapo's controversial election victory Monday, Mozambique plunged into turmoil, leaving scores dead amid violent protests. Some analysts expressed concern that continued political violence could destabilize regional security and impede economic development, sparking weapons proliferation and criminal activity. Solomon Mondlane, a political analyst in Mozambique, told VOA he is cautiously optimistic that South African and European efforts can help calm the situation. 'The situation is volatile,' Mondlane said. 'The good news is we're hearing more calls from different countries — from South Africa, from other European countries — calling for more dialogue. South Africa has come out to say they are willing to facilitate a dialogue. 'We know that South Africa's ANC-led government has been in support of Frelimo,' the ruling political party,' he said. 'They were the first to congratulate Frelimo for winning these rigged elections. But we are happy that they are adhering to the calls now to say we are willing to facilitate dialogue between the opposition in Mozambique and the ruling party.' Levy Ndou, a South African political analyst and lecturer at Tshwane University of Technology in Johannesburg, said he believes regional players’ efforts at dialogue with the Mozambican government are encouraging signs that many in the region are seeking peace and stability. 'Of course, if the situation gets out of hand, it will therefore require the intervention of SADC in order to ensure that there is peace, there is stability and, indeed, there is economic activity that is going on,' Ndou said, referring to the Southern African Development Community. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the SADC chair, has said the regional bloc is ready to assist Mozambique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-reroutes-mozambique-trade-travel-to-eswatini-border-amid-violence/7916961.html	2024-12-28T07:10:44-08:00	
Turkey's pro-Kurd party to meet jailed PKK leader on Saturday	ISTANBUL — A delegation from Turkey's main pro-Kurdish DEM party is due on Saturday to visit jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence on a prison island off Istanbul, a party source said. 'The delegation left in the morning,' the source told AFP, without elaborating how they would travel to the island for security reasons. The visit would be the party's first in almost 10 years. DEM's predecessor, the HDP party, last met Ocalan in April 2015. On Friday, the government approved DEM's request to visit Ocalan, who founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, nearly half a century ago and has languished in solitary confinement since 1999. The PKK is regarded as a terror organization by Turkey and most of its Western allies, including the United States and European Union. The DEM party delegation is made up of two lawmakers — Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan. They are not expected to make a statement after the visit, the same source told AFP. Detained 25 years ago in a Hollywood-style operation by Turkish security forces in Kenya after years on the run, Ocalan was sentenced to death. He escaped the gallows when Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2004 and is spending his remaining years in an isolation cell on the Imrali prison island south of Istanbul. Saturday's rare visit became possible after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's nationalist ally Devlet Bahceli invited Ocalan to come to parliament to renounce 'terror' and to disband the militant group. Bahceli, who heads the ultra-nationalist MHP party, is fiercely hostile to the PKK. Erdogan backed the unprecedented appeal as a 'historic window of opportunity.' 'My dear Kurdish brothers, we expect you to firmly grasp [Bahceli's] sincerely outstretched hand,' he said in October, urging them to join in efforts to build what he called the 'century of Turkey.' Soon after Bahceli's call, Ocalan was allowed his first family visit since March 2020, prompting DEM to make its own request to the Justice Ministry to visit the 75-year-old militant. PKK militants subsequently claimed responsibility for an attack in October on a Turkish defense firm that killed five. That delayed the government approval of DEM's request. For several years up to 2015, Ocalan was engaged in talks with authorities, when then-Prime Minister Erdogan called for a solution for what is often called Turkey's 'Kurdish problem.' The peace process and a truce collapsed in 2015, sparking the resumption of violence, especially in the Kurdish-majority southeast. The government's surprise olive branch to the Kurds comes after rebels in neighboring Syria overthrew strongman president Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Turkey routinely targets Kurdish fighters in northern Syria and Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-pro-kurd-party-to-meet-jailed-pkk-leader-on-saturday/7916870.html	2024-12-28T03:37:00-08:00	
Ukraine says it struck drone depot in Russia's Oryol region	Ukraine said on Saturday it had struck a storage and maintenance depot for long-range Shahed drones in Russia's Oryol region, adding that this had 'significantly reduced' Russia's ability to launch mass drone attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine military's general staff said in a statement on Telegram the attack took place on Thursday and was conducted by Ukraine's air force. 'As a result of the strike, a depot for storage, maintenance and repair of Shahed kamikaze drones, made of several protected concrete structures, was destroyed,' it said. 'This military operation has significantly reduced the enemy's potential in terms of conducting air raids of strike drones on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.' Moscow has not made any comment on the attack. Russia has regularly launched missile and drone attacks on Ukraine throughout its 34-month invasion. For the past several months, Moscow has launched near-daily barrages of dozens of drones at Ukraine, hoping to damage its infrastructure and wear down air defenses leaving them less able to shoot down missiles. Ukraine's air force said earlier on Saturday it had downed 15 out of 16 drones launched by Russia overnight, with the other one disappearing from radar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-struck-drone-depot-in-russia-s-oryol-region/7916862.html	2024-12-28T03:16:24-08:00	
Major Gaza hospital shut after Israeli raid, officials say	GAZA STRIP — An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the World Health Organization and health officials said Saturday. The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility 'useless,' further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said. 'This morning's raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital has put this last major health facility in north Gaza out of service. Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid,' the World Health Organization said overnight on X, referring to the Israeli operation that began in the early hours of Friday. The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remain in the hospital. Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the U.N. health agency said, adding it was 'deeply concerned for their safety.' Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces detained Kamal Adwan Hospital's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members. Gaza's civil defense agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout. The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. In the days leading up to the raid, Abu Safiyeh had repeatedly warned about the hospital's precarious situation, accusing Israeli forces of targeting the facility. On Monday, he issued a statement accusing Israel of targeting the hospital 'with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside.' On Thursday, Abu Safiyeh said five staff members of the hospital had been killed in an Israeli strike near the facility. Since Oct. 6, Israel has intensified its land and air offensive in northern Gaza, saying its goal is to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping. The military said Friday that it was acting on intelligence regarding 'terrorist infrastructure and operatives' in the hospital's vicinity. 'Heinous crime' Before initiating the latest operation near the hospital, the military said its troops had 'facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients, and medical personnel.' Hamas has denied claims its operatives were present at the hospital, accusing Israeli forces of storming it on Friday. 'The enemy's lies about the hospital aim to justify the heinous crime committed by the occupation army today, involving the evacuation and burning of all hospital departments as part of a plan for extermination and forced displacement,' Hamas said in a statement. Gaza's health ministry had earlier quoted Abu Safiyeh reporting that the military had 'set on fire all surgery departments of the hospital.' Abu Safiyeh said the military had also 'evacuated the entire medical staff and displaced people.' 'There are a large number of injuries among the medical team.' Iran, which backs Hamas, 'strongly condemned the brutal attack,' with a foreign ministry statement calling it 'the latest example of war crimes, crimes against humanity, gross violations of international law and norms.' Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The Israeli military has regularly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces throughout the war. Hamas has denied the accusations. The WHO reiterated its call for a ceasefire. 'This raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital comes after escalating restrictions on access for WHO and partners, and repeated attacks on or near the facility since early October,' the WHO said. 'Such hostilities and the raids are undoing all our efforts and support to keep the facility minimal functional. The systematic dismantling of the health system in Gaza is a death sentence for tens of thousands of Palestinians in need of health care.' Meanwhile, Hamas's media center reported 'massive Israeli air and artillery strikes in Beit Hanoun,' in northern Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed hundreds of militants since the stepped-up assault in northern Gaza began on October 6, while rescuers in the area say thousands of civilians have died in the sweeping offensive. Gaza civil defense also reported that in a separate Israeli strike in central Gaza at least nine Palestinians were killed on Saturday. The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year, which resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,436 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the U.N. considers reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/major-gaza-hospital-shut-after-israeli-raid-officials-say/7916848.html	2024-12-28T01:59:45-08:00	
Israel says it intercepted missile from Yemen, day after Sanaa hit with strikes	SANAA, YEMEN — The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Saturday, a day after the Houthi-held capital Sanaa was hit by fresh airstrikes. Sirens sounded in areas of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea on Saturday as 'a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted ... prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the Israeli military said. The day before, a fresh airstrike hit Sanaa, which Houthi rebels blamed on 'U.S.-British aggression' though it remains unclear who was behind it. There was no comment from Israel, the United States or Britain. 'I heard the blast. My house shook,' one Sanaa resident told AFP late Friday. The Iran-backed Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing Sanaa and ousting the government in 2014. Since the eruption of war in Gaza in October last year, the Houthis -- claiming solidarity with Palestinians -- have fired a series of missiles and drones at Israel. They have stepped up their attacks since November's ceasefire between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has also struck Yemen, including targeting Sanaa's international airport on Thursday in an attack that came as the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. The Houthis have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, prompting reprisal strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain. Earlier Friday, before the strike on Sanaa, tens of thousands of people gathered to protest and express solidarity with Palestinians. 'The equation has changed and has become: (targeting) airport for airport, port for port, and infrastructure for infrastructure,' Houthi supporter Mohammed al-Gobisi said. 'We will not get tired or bored of supporting our brothers in Gaza.' The war in Gaza was triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Airport damaged Israel's strike on the Sanaa international airport on Thursday shattered windows and left the top of the control tower a bombed-out shell. A witness told AFP that the raids also targeted the adjacent Al-Dailami air base, which shares the airport's runway. 'The attack resulted in four dead until now and around 20 wounded from staff, airport and passengers,' Houthi Deputy Transport Minister Yahya al-Sayani said. It occurred as the head of the U.N.'s World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was preparing to fly out, and left one U.N. crew member injured. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of U.N. staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He later posted on social media that he had safely reached Jordan with his team. He said the injured member of the U.N.'s Humanitarian Air Service 'underwent successful surgery and is now in stable condition.' Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that the WHO chief was there. An Israeli statement said its targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida -- a major entry point for humanitarian aid -- as well as other facilities at several ports. Houthis use these sites 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. But U.N. humanitarian coordinator Julien Harneis said the airport was 'a civilian location' which the UN also uses, and the strikes took place as 'a packed civilian airliner from Yemenia Air, carrying hundreds of Yemenis, was about to land.' Although the plane 'was able to land safely ... it could have been far, far worse,' Harneis said. In his latest warning to the Houthis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's strikes would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Despite the damage, flights at Sanaa airport resumed at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday, deputy transport minister Sayani said. Yemenis depend on aid U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the escalation in hostilities and said bombing transportation infrastructure threatened humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80% of the population depends on aid. The United Nations has called Yemen 'the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,' with 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian aid and protection. The airport is 'absolutely vital' to continue transporting aid for Yemen, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Harneis said. 'If that airport is disabled, it will paralyze humanitarian operations.' After the attack on Sanaa airport, Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv and launched drones at the city and a ship in the Arabian Sea. The Israeli military said the same day a missile launched from Yemen had been intercepted. Israeli 'aggression will only increase the determination and resolve of the great Yemeni people to continue supporting the Palestinian people,' a Houthi statement said Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-intercepted-missile-from-yemen-day-after-sanaa-hit-with-strikes/7916831.html	2024-12-28T00:17:29-08:00	
Amputees in Sierra Leone turn to farming to combat discrimination	FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE — Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass. 'They forgot I had one leg,' the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: 'We fall and we rise.' The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels. But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country. Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week. More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets. 'No one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,' Makieu said. The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees' confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They've trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work. The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter. At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor. 'Many (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don't believe they have love,' the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war. First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital. But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders. His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don't fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many. Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child. Makieu wants to inspire future farmers. 'It's my dream to teach people about life. It's about changing your mindset,' he said. Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke. 'We are created for fellowship, not isolation,' he said. 'When we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.' Makieu interjected: 'I sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.' But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support. Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master's degree in social work, he cannot find a job. 'Even if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,' Kani said. Sierra Leone's National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination. Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education. But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. 'The government don't keep their promises. It's inhumane,' Kani said. There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said. Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions. A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand. Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population. Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone. Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer. 'Any successful story, there must be painful experiences,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amputees-in-sierra-leone-turn-to-farming-to-combat-discrimination/7916767.html	2024-12-28T00:04:54-08:00	
Somali migrant who survived boat sinking wants to try again for Europe	MOGADISHU, Somalia — Idil Abdullahi Goley's journey seeking a better life in Europe started in Somalia with a $6,500 payment to local smugglers. It ended a month later with fellow migrants around her dying at sea, one of them screaming and reciting the Muslim profession of faith. The deaths of 25 migrants last month in boats off the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar brought to light yet another route that some in Africa are taking in dangerous bids for Europe. Goley was one of the 48 people rescued. She spoke to The Associated Press about the journey that thousands of Somalis embark on every year as extremist attacks and climate shocks destroy hopes and livelihoods at home. Some Somalis head for the Gulf countries via the Red Sea and Yemen. Others, like Goley, gamble on a longer sea voyage south, toward the French island territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, the poorest territory in the European Union. Somalis are among an estimated 100,000 migrants living in Mayotte, according to French authorities. The migrants are part of communities affected after Cyclone Chido leveled entire neighborhoods on December 14. The International Organization for Migration has estimated that 2 million people migrated from Somalia in 2021 in search of work, the latest data available. Children left behind Goley, 28, heard about the smugglers from friends who had traveled the route and raised the $6,500 fee from her small tea shop business in the capital, Mogadishu, and from her brother and mother. She hoped to reach Europe and pay them back. She left her three small children behind. Her journey began with a flight from Mogadishu to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Then she and others took a bus to the port city of Mombasa, where they set off in fishing boats for Mayotte, more than 620 miles (997 kilometers) away. They hoped to request asylum there. After three days at sea, the group of about 70 migrants was transferred to smaller boats, whose engines started to fail. The smugglers said they would fix the engines and left with them on another boat, leaving the migrants drifting without water and food. They started catching fish and collecting rainwater to survive. It was nearly cyclone season, and waves were choppy. Goley said she tried to save the life of an infant whose mother was also on board but struggling. 'But she died right in front of me. We couldn't hold on to her body for long and had to throw it into the sea to prevent it from decomposing, as more people perished around us,' she said. During 13 days of hunger, thirst and heat, Goley's two friends also died. She held one in her lap as she passed. 'The other screamed for help. I couldn't help her and she died shortly after, crying out loudly, reciting the Shahada,' Goley said. 'That is an image I will never forget, the suffering and helplessness we felt.' She said the ordeal ended when a fishing boat appeared on the horizon and the survivors waved for help. They offered the fishermen $100 for their rescue and were taken to a sports facility in Nosy Be in northern Madagascar. The migrants were repatriated in early December by chartered plane. Back home, Goley's mother had feared the worst. Unable to eat, she had lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds). 'When I returned home, my mother couldn't believe it until she heard my voice and saw me in person,' Goley said. Another attempt As she and the other survivors arrived in Mogadishu, the Somali president's special envoy on refugee affairs expressed hope for their future and said the government would help. 'They assured me they will never take the same risk again,' Maryan Yasin said. But Goley said she plans to attempt another journey on the same route, despite having nightmares about her ordeal. The hardships in Somalia are still the same, she said — and she did pay the smugglers' fee. 'Even if it leads me to prison, I believe I'd still find a better life than the one I have here,' she said. Her mother, meanwhile, fears this time she will never return. Other survivors are undecided as they mourn. Ahmed Hussein Mahadalle, 26, had watched helplessly as his sister Hanan, 21, died. Nothing compares to the pain of it, he said. His other sister, Haboon Hussein Mahadalle, was grateful for her brother's safe return, though he also has plans to try again. 'Hanan was courageous and vigilant. She met her fate with grace,' Haboon said, in tears. 'They say good people don't stay long, and my sister embodied all the qualities I can't begin to summarize.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-migrant-who-survived-boat-sinking-wants-to-try-again-for-europe/7915540.html	2024-12-28T00:02:47-08:00	
US agency says decongestant in many cold medicines doesn't work. So what does?	WASHINGTON — Changes are coming to the cold and cough aisle of your local pharmacy: U.S. officials are moving to phase out the leading decongestant found in hundreds of over-the-counter medicines, concluding that it doesn't actually relieve nasal congestion. Phenylephrine is used in popular versions of Sudafed, Dayquil and other medications, but experts have long questioned its effectiveness. Last month the Food and Drug Administration formally proposed revoking its use in pills and liquid solutions, kicking off a process that's likely to force drugmakers to remove or reformulate products. It's a win for skeptical academics, including researchers at the University of Florida who petitioned the FDA to revisit the drug's use in 2007 and again in 2015. For consumers it will likely mean switching to alternatives, including an older decongestant that was moved behind the pharmacy counter nearly 20 years ago. Doctors say Americans will be better off without phenylephrine, which is often combined with other medicines to treat cold, flu, fever and allergies. 'People walk into the drugstore today and see 55,000 medicines on the shelf and they pick one that is definitely not going to work,' said Dr. Brian Schroer of the Cleveland Clinic. 'You take away that option and it will be easier for them to self-direct toward products that really will help them.' Why is FDA doing this now? The FDA decision was expected after federal advisers last year voted unanimously that oral phenylephrine medications haven't been shown to relieve congestion. Experts reviewed several recent, large studies indicating that phenylephrine was no better than a placebo at clearing nasal passageways. They also revisited studies from the 1960s and 1970s that supported the drug's initial use, finding numerous flaws and questionable data. The panel's opinion only applied to phenylephrine in oral medications, which account for roughly $1.8 billion in annual U.S. sales. The drug is still considered effective in nasal sprays, though those are much less popular. Phenylephrine wasn't always the top choice for cold and allergy products. Many were originally formulated with a different drug, pseudoephedrine. But a 2006 law required pharmacies to move pseudoephedrine products behind the counter, citing their potential to be processed into methamphetamine. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Bayer decided to reformulate their products to keep them readily available on store shelves — and labeled many of them as 'PE' versions of familiar brand names. What are some alternatives for congestion? Consumers who still want to take pills or syrups for relief will probably need to head to the pharmacy counter — where the pseudoephedrine-containing versions of Sudafed, Claritin D and other products remain available without a prescription. Purchasers need to provide a photo ID. Beyond those products, most of the other options are over-the-counter nasal sprays or solutions. Saline drops and rinses are a quick way to clear mucus from the nose. For long-term relief from seasonal stuffiness, itching and sneezing, many doctors recommend nasal steroids, sold as Flonase, Nasacort and Rhinocort. 'These medicines are by far the most effective daily treatment for nasal congestion and stuffiness,' Schroer said. 'The biggest issue is they're not great when used on an as-needed basis.' Nasal steroids generally have to be used daily to be highly effective. For short-term relief, patients can try antihistamine sprays, such as Astepro, which are faster acting. Phenylephrine-based sprays will also remain on pharmacy shelves. Why doesn't phenylephrine work when taken by mouth? The experts who challenged the drug's effectiveness say it's quickly broken down and rendered ineffective when it hits the stomach. 'This is a good drug, but not when it's swallowed,' said Leslie Hendeles, professor emeritus at the University of Florida's College of Pharmacy, where he co-authored several papers on the ingredient. 'It's inactivated in the gut and doesn't get into the bloodstream, so it can't get to the nose.' When Hendeles and his colleagues first petitioned the FDA on phenylephrine, they suggested a higher dose might be effective. But subsequent studies showed that even doses 400% higher than those currently recommended don't treat stuffiness. The FDA and other researchers concluded that pushing the dosage even higher might carry safety risks. 'If you're using very high doses, the risk is raising blood pressure so high that it could be hazardous to patients,' said Randy Hatton, a University of Florida professor who co-led the research on phenylephrine. Because of its cardiovascular effects, the drug is sometimes used to treat dangerously low blood pressure during surgery, Hatton noted. What happens next? Oral phenylephrine medicines will still be with us for a while. Government regulators must follow a public, multistep process to remove the ingredient from FDA's list of drugs approved for over-the-counter decongestants. For six months, the FDA must take comments on its proposal, including from consumers and companies. Then, the FDA must review the feedback before writing a final order. Even after that decision is finalized, companies will likely have a year or more to remove or reformulate products. Drugmakers could further delay the process by requesting additional FDA hearings. For now, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association — which represents medicine makers — wants the products to stay available, saying Americans deserve 'the option to choose the products they prefer for self-care.' Hatton says he and his colleagues disagree: 'Our position is that choosing from something that doesn't work isn't really a choice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-says-decongestant-in-many-cold-medicines-doesn-t-work-so-what-does-/7914334.html	2024-12-28T00:01:58-08:00	
Death toll in Brazil bridge collapse rises to 10	BRASILIA, BRAZIL — The death toll after a bridge collapsed in northern Brazil increased to 10 on Friday, authorities said. The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge, which connects the states of Maranhao and Tocantins, collapsed on Sunday, sending vehicles and their occupants plunging into the water below. The Brazilian navy had been conducting rescues in the area, finding an additional body Thursday 6 kilometers from the accident site and a second victim Friday in the Tocantins River. 'As such, there are 10 dead and seven missing victims so far,' the navy said in a statement, updating Thursday's toll of eight dead and nine missing. More than 70 rescuers continued the search nearly a week after the collapse, using a hyperbaric chamber to allow divers to search depths of more than 30 meters. On Tuesday, Brazilian authorities had warned that the Tocantins River could have been contaminated with sulfuric acid being transported by two trucks that tumbled into the water. A third truck involved in the accident was carrying pesticides. A spokesperson for the fire department later told AFP that the tanks of all three trucks were 'intact' after the collapse. The danger from those chemicals, however, had slowed rescue and body-recovery operations for days while water analyses and inspections of the trucks' chemical tank trailers were carried out. The bridge, initially constructed in the 1960s, measured roughly 500 meters long. The causes of the collapse were being investigated, but officials said initial indications were that the central beam of the bridge gave way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-brazil-bridge-collapse-rises-to-10-/7916776.html	2024-12-27T18:53:31-08:00	
Fear, chaos grip Maputo after postelection violence	Maputo, mozambique — Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is limping back to normal but residents are still fearful because of widespread looting and vandalism sparked by confirmation that the ruling party won contested elections. Food, fuel and medicine are running low for the city's inhabitants while the daring escape of more than 1,000 inmates from a maximum-security prison is fueling wild rumors and prompted the creation of neighborhood patrols. 'My neighbor woke me up, telling me that men armed with machetes were walking around,' Maria Amelia, 55, a cleaner who lives in Matola, near Maputo, told AFP. 'When I went out, I saw my neighbors, armed with knives to defend themselves against these invaders. But I didn't see anyone. I was terrified.' Maputo bank worker Armand Tembe, 40, was also dragged out of bed before dawn. 'I haven't seen any criminals outside. But it's starting to get scary. I don't know where the country is going,' he said dejectedly. 'We stayed up until 4:30 in the morning and patrolled for something we only heard about and that no one saw,' said another woman, who wanted to remain anonymous. 'It was just hearsay. It makes it seem like a macabre plan.' Borges Nhamirre, a Pretoria-based Mozambican researcher, said that so far, 'there have been no verified reports of attacks of this kind.' But the fact that the police chief, speaking to reporters Wednesday evening, 'announced that detainees could 'visit' houses has fueled concern,' he added. 'The prevailing sentiment in the conversations suggests that the government may have invented this crisis to control the ongoing social unrest,' he said. 'Manipulation' Venancio Mondlane, Mozambique's main opposition leader, has denounced the October 9 election results as rigged. On Monday, the country's highest court confirmed victory for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. That set off riots that left more than 125 dead over several days, according to the local NGO Plataforma Decide. 'We know who the real bandits are. It's Frelimo,' Mondlane said on social networks on Friday. On the streets of Maputo, makeshift barricades were slowly being dismantled, while the army was clearing some roads, according to AFP reporters on the ground. Residents were cautiously leaving their homes to look for basic necessities. 'I'm looking for bread,' said Isabel Rocha, 29, in the Laulane district of the city, after a sleepless night because of security fears. 'The bakeries have been closed for four days. In fact, we lack everything. Even the small grocery stores are closed.' Lina Chauque, 47, sat despondently on the pavement with a large bundle containing heads of lettuce and cabbage next to her. She had been waiting for two hours with several other women for a bus to arrive to sell her products at market. 'We tried to ask for help from some trucks that passed but the drivers did not want to take us,' she said. A short distance away, cars queued patiently outside a gas station where only one pump still had fuel. 'I am looking for medicine for me and my mother,' said Tomas Panguene, 65, who suffers from knee pain. 'Yesterday I went out to find a pharmacy but the streets were still barricaded. I found what I needed this morning.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fear-chaos-grip-maputo-after-postelection-violence-/7916769.html	2024-12-27T18:01:21-08:00	
Mexico tests cellphone app migrants can use to send alert if detained in US	Mexico city — Mexico is developing a cellphone app that will allow migrants to warn relatives and local consulates if they think they are about to be detained by U.S. immigration authorities, a senior official said Friday. The move comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to carry out mass deportations after he takes office on Jan. 20. The app has been rolled out for small-scale testing and 'appears to be working very well,' said Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs. He said the app would allow users to press a tab that would send an alert notification to previously chosen relatives and the nearest Mexican consulate. De la Fuente described it as a sort of panic button. 'In case you find yourself in a situation where detention is imminent, you push the alert button, and that sends a signal to the nearest consulate,' he said. U.S. authorities are obliged to give notice to home-country consulates when a foreign citizen is detained. Mexico says it has beefed up consular staff and legal aid to help migrants in the legal process related to deportation. De la Fuente expects the app to be rolled out in January. He didn't say whether the app has a deactivation tab that would allow someone to rescind an alert if that person wasn't really detained. The government says it has also set up a call center staffed 24 hours a day to answer migrants' questions. The Mexican government estimates there are 11.5 million migrants with some form of legal residency in the United States, and 4.8 million without legal residency or proper documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-tests-cellphone-app-migrants-can-use-to-send-alert-if-detained-in-us/7916764.html	2024-12-27T17:31:05-08:00	
Anger over abductions mounts in Kenya	Nairobi, kenya — Kenyan rights groups, lawyers and politicians voiced grave concern Friday over a fresh spate of abductions targeting government critics. A small protest was organized in northeastern Embu town, where a 24-year-old man, Billy Mwangi, disappeared last weekend. Security forces in the East African nation have been accused of carrying out dozens of illegal detentions since youth-led anti-government demonstrations in June and July. The latest disappearances have been primarily young men who have criticized President William Ruto online. Police have denied involvement, but activists have questioned why they appear not to be investigating the disappearances. The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) said recent denials by the inspector-general of police were 'insufficient,' calling for him to take clear action against the kidnappers or resign. 'If indeed the police are not complicit,' LSK said, they must immediately 'investigate and prosecute those responsible.' Human Rights Watch said earlier this year that its research pointed toward a unit drawn from multiple security agencies. Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who was ousted after clashing with Ruto over the protests, also alleged on Friday that a secret unit was behind the disappearances. 'Abducting these children and killing them is not a solution. ... This is the first administration in the history of this country to target children for repression,' Gachagua said at a press conference. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said Thursday that there had been 82 abductions carried out 'clandestinely, with unidentified armed persons' since June, with 29 still missing. It listed seven people who had been abducted since December 17. Two of them — Mwangi and Peter Muteti — were taken shortly after sharing AI-generated images of Ruto dead. The Kenyan judiciary said this week that 'abductions have no place in law and indeed are a direct threat to the rights of citizens.' In a post on X on Thursday, it urged 'security agencies and all connected entities to adhere to the law to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms.' The anti-government demonstrations earlier this year were sparked by proposed tax hikes, triggering the worst crisis since Ruto took power in 2022. While large-scale rallies have mostly stopped, anger against the government has simmered, fueled by a cost-of-living crisis and continued allegations of brutality by the security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-over-abductions-mounts-in-kenya/7916747.html	2024-12-27T17:14:15-08:00	
WHO chief describes Israeli strike on Yemen airport	ZURICH — The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that he was not sure he was going to survive an airstrike on Yemen's main airport carried out by Israel a day earlier during a series of attacks on the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Speaking at the Sanaa International Airport on Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the explosions that rocked the building were so deafening that his ears were still ringing more than a day later. Tedros said it quickly became apparent the airport was under attack, describing people 'running in disarray' through the site after about four blasts, one of them close to where he was sitting near the departure lounge. 'I was not sure actually I could survive because it was so close, a few meters from where we were,' he told Reuters. 'A slight deviation could have resulted in a direct hit.' Tedros said he and his colleagues were stuck at the airport for the next hour or so as what he thought were drones flew overhead, feeding concern they could open fire again. Among the debris, he and colleagues saw missile fragments, he said. 'There [was] no shelter at all. Nothing. So, you're just exposed, just waiting for anything to happen,' he said. The Israeli strikes on Yemen came after Houthis repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel was 'just getting started' with the Houthis. The Houthi-controlled Saba News Agency said three people died in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, with 40 others wounded in the attacks. Speaking by telephone from Jordan, where he flew to Friday, helping to evacuate a U.N. colleague seriously injured at the airport for further medical treatment, Tedros said he had received no warning Israel could be about to strike the airport. The injured man, who worked for the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, was now 'OK' and in stable condition, Tedros said. Tedros traveled to Yemen to try to negotiate the release of U.N. staff and others held there. He acknowledged that he and colleagues knew the trip was risky in light of high tension between Israel and the Houthis. But such was the window of opportunity to work for the release of the U.N. personnel that they believed they had to take it, said Tedros, a former Ethiopian foreign minister. He said talks with Yemeni authorities had gone well and that he saw a chance that the 16 U.N. staff as well as employees of diplomatic missions and NGO workers held there could be freed. He declined to engage in recriminations over the attack but said his itinerary had been shared publicly and expressed surprise that civilian infrastructure should have been targeted. 'A civilian airport should be protected, whether I am in it or not,' he said, before observing there was 'nothing special' about what he had faced in Yemen. 'One of my colleagues said we narrowly escaped death. I'm just one human being. So, I feel for those who are facing the same thing every single day. But at least it allowed me to feel the way they feel. 'I'm worried about our world, where it's heading,' Tedros added, urging world leaders to work together to end global conflicts. 'I have never ... as far as I can remember, seen the world really being in such a very dangerous state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-describes-israeli-strike-on-yemen-airport-/7916743.html	2024-12-27T17:01:16-08:00	
CDC says bird flu virus likely mutated within a US patient	A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation’s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week. Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans — something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work. 'Is this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,' Osterholm said. 'Right now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn’t open the door.' The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the United States; nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. The patient in the U.S. state of Louisiana was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month. The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were 'concerning,' but the risk to the general public from the outbreak 'has not changed and remains low.' Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what’s happening with mutations carefully. 'There will be additional influenza pandemics, and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,' he said. 'We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-says-bird-flu-virus-likely-mutated-within-a-us-patient/7916733.html	2024-12-27T16:48:38-08:00	
Venezuela accuses Argentine officer of terrorism as relations deteriorate	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — An Argentine military officer who was arrested in Venezuela earlier this month has been charged with terrorism, Venezuela’s attorney general said Friday. In a statement published on Instagram, Attorney General Tarek William Saab accused the officer, Nahuel Gallo, of 'being part of a group of people who tried to commit destabilizing and terrorist acts [in Venezuela] with the support of international far-right groups.' In a news conference Friday, Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich described the charges as 'another lie' by Venezuela’s government and said that Gallo should be returned to Argentina 'immediately.' The case has ramped up tensions between Venezuela’s socialist government and the right-wing administration of Argentine President Javier Milei, whose embassy in Caracas is sheltering five high-profile opposition activists and is surrounded by Venezuelan security forces. Gallo, a corporal in Argentina’s Gendarmerie security force, was detained by Venezuelan officials on Dec. 8 after he showed up at an immigration office along Venezuela’s border with Colombia and sought permission to enter the country. Gallo’s relatives said that he had traveled to Venezuela to visit his wife, who is Venezuelan, and was in the country to spend some time with her mother. They have published an invitation letter that was sent to Gallo, and said he was on vacation at the time of his arrest. Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Argentina in August after Milei and several other Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection in July of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Argentina’s diplomats were expelled, but the five opposition activists, who had sought refuge at the ambassador’s residence to avoid arrest, remained in the building after they were denied safe passage out of Venezuela. The activists, who have been holed up in the embassy since March, recently said that Venezuelan security forces have cut off electricity and water to the residence in a bid to pressure them to leave the building. Venezuela officials have denied those accusations and said that the activists used the Argentine Embassy to plan terrorist acts. The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said earlier this week that 19 foreigners are being held in Venezuela as political prisoners. In September, two Spanish citizens who were on vacation in the south of Venezuela were arrested and accused of being part of a plot to overthrow Maduro. They were arrested just days after Spain’s parliament recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-accuses-argentine-officer-of-terrorism-as-relations-deteriorate-/7916551.html	2024-12-27T16:45:15-08:00	
US proposes cybersecurity rules to limit impact of health data leaks	Health care organizations may be required to bolster their cybersecurity to better prevent sensitive information from being leaked by cyberattacks like the ones that hit Ascension and UnitedHealth, a senior White House official said Friday. Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters that proposed requirements are necessary in light of the massive number of Americans whose data has been affected by large breaches of health care information. The proposals include encrypting data so it cannot be accessed, even if leaked, and requiring compliance checks to ensure networks meet cybersecurity rules. The full proposed rule was posted to the Federal Register on Friday, and the Department of Health and Human Services posted a more condensed breakdown on its website. She said that the health care information of more than 167 million people was affected in 2023 as a result of cybersecurity incidents. The proposed rule from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS would update standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and would cost an estimated $9 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in years two through five, Neuberger said. 'We've made some significant proposals that we think will improve cybersecurity and ultimately everyone's health information, if any of these proposals are ultimately finalized,' an OCR spokesperson told Reuters late Friday. The next step in the process is a 60-day public comment period before any final decisions will be made. Large health care breaches caused by hacking and ransomware have increased by 89% and 102%, respectively, since 2019, Neuberger said. 'In this job, one of the most concerning and really troubling things we deal with is hacking of hospitals, hacking of health care data,' she said. Hospitals have been forced to operate manually and Americans' sensitive health care data, mental health information and other information are 'being leaked on the dark web with the opportunity to blackmail individuals,' Neuberger said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-proposes-cybersecurity-rules-to-limit-impact-of-health-data-leaks-/7916725.html	2024-12-27T16:38:12-08:00	
US sportscaster Greg Gumbel dies from cancer at age 78	NEW YORK — Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster, has died from cancer, according to a statement from family released by CBS on Friday. He was 78. 'He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,' his wife, Marcy Gumbel, and daughter, Michelle Gumbel, said in a statement. In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 because of what he said at the time were family health issues. Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties. In 2001, Gumbel announced Super Bowl XXXV for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship. David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as breaking barriers and setting standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness. 'A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,' said Berson. Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998. He hosted CBS's coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS's NFL studio show, 'The NFL Today' from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004. He also called NFL games as the network's lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sportscaster-greg-gumbel-dies-from-cancer-at-age-78-/7916545.html	2024-12-27T16:03:27-08:00	
Trump asks court to delay possible TikTok ban until he can weigh in as president	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by January 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk. 'President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,' said Trump's amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case. The filings come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for January 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and 'seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-court-to-delay-possible-tiktok-ban-until-he-can-weigh-in-as-president/7916535.html	2024-12-27T15:31:45-08:00	
US appeals court halts enforcement of anti-money laundering law	A U.S. appeals court has halted enforcement of an anti-money laundering law that requires corporate entities to disclose the identities of their real beneficial owners to the U.S. Treasury Department ahead of a deadline for most companies to do so. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated late Thursday a nationwide injunction that had been issued this month by a federal judge in Texas who had concluded the Corporate Transparency Act was unconstitutional. The order marked a change of course for the court. On Monday, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit at the urging of the U.S. Department of Justice put the injunction on hold while the government appealed the Texas judge's decision. But a different panel will ultimately decide whether to uphold the judge's ruling, and in Thursday's order, the court said it decided to keep enforcement of the law paused 'to preserve the constitutional status quo while the merits panel considers the parties' weighty substantive arguments.' Those arguments will be heard on March 25, the court said Friday. Before Thursday's order, most companies had faced a Jan. 13 deadline to submit their initial reports to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The injunction had been obtained by the National Federation of Independent Business, which along with several small businesses challenged the law through lawyers at the conservative Center for Individual Rights. 'Given that we have established that the CTA is likely unconstitutional, this intrusive form of government surveillance should be halted until the law's fate is finally resolved,' Todd Gaziano, the Center for Individual Rights' president, said in a statement. FinCEN did not respond to requests for comment. Under the law, which was enacted in 2021, corporations and LLCs were required to report information concerning their beneficial owners to FinCEN, which collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat money laundering and other crimes. The measure's supporters said it was designed to address the country's growing popularity as a venue for criminals to launder illicit funds by setting up entities such as limited liability companies under state laws without disclosing their involvement. U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in Sherman, Texas, on Dec. 3 ruled Congress had no authority under its powers to regulate commerce, taxes and foreign affairs to adopt the 'quasi-Orwellian statute' and that it likely violated states' rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-halts-enforcement-of-anti-money-laundering-law-/7916461.html	2024-12-27T14:19:45-08:00	
UN approves new AU force to take on al-Shabab in Somalia	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council on Friday gave the green light to a new African Union force in Somalia that is meant to take on the Islamist armed group al-Shabab, with the soldiers due to deploy in January. The resolution was adopted by 14 of the council's 15 member states, while the United States abstained due to reservations about funding. It provides for the replacement of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, whose mandate ends on Dec. 31, by the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). Somalia is one of the world's poorest countries, enduring decades of civil war, a bloody insurgency by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab and frequent climate disasters. Representatives from Somalia and its western neighbor Ethiopia were invited to participate in the council's meeting, although they were not allowed to vote. 'We emphasize that the current AUSSOM troops allocations are completed through bilateral agreements,' said the Somali representative, adding 11,000 troops were currently pledged. On Monday, Egypt's foreign minister announced his country would take part in the new force. Tensions flared in the Horn of Africa after Ethiopia signed a maritime deal in January with the breakaway region of Somaliland, pushing Mogadishu closer to Addis Ababa's regional rival Cairo. This month, Turkey brokered a deal to end the nearly yearlong bitter dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia, although Ethiopian troops would not be involved in the new AU force. Burundi will not be taking part in the new force either, a Burundian military source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. The text adopted by the U.N. Security Council provides for the possibility of using a mechanism that it created last year, under which an African force deployed with the green light of the U.N. can be up to 75% financed by the U.N. 'In our view, the conditions have not been met for immediate transition to application of' that measure, U.S. representative Dorothy Shea said, justifying her country's abstention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-approves-new-au-force-to-take-on-al-shabab-in-somalia-/7916486.html	2024-12-27T14:18:05-08:00

Engineer pleads not guilty in US case of deadly Iran-linked drone strike	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A former engineer at a semiconductor manufacturer pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. charges that he illegally procured technology for an Iranian firm that made a key component of a drone used in a January attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members. Mahdi Sadeghi, who was fired by Analog Devices after his Dec. 16 arrest, pleaded not guilty during a hearing in federal court in Boston to charges that he engaged in a scheme to violate U.S. export control and sanctions laws. He entered the plea nearly two weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against the dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and the head of an Iranian navigation systems manufacturer, Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested in Italy. Prosecutors said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was the primary customer of Abedini's company, San'at Danesh Rahpooyan Aflak Co, which made the navigation system used in its military drone program. Prosecutors say that system was used in an unmanned drone that struck a U.S. outpost in Jordan called Tower 22, near the Syrian border, in an attack that killed three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgia and injured 47 others. The White House has said the attack was facilitated by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization of hardline Iran-backed militant groups. Iran has denied involvement in the attack, and its Foreign Ministry was quoted in Iranian media Saturday saying the arrests of Sadeghi and Abedini, an Iranian citizen, violated international law. Prosecutors said that in 2016, Sadeghi, a resident of Natick, Massachusetts, traveled to Iran to seek funding from a governmental organization for a fitness wearables company that he had co-founded. Through an affiliated Iranian company he established, Sadeghi began helping procure U.S.-origin electronic components on behalf of Abedini, who is also known as Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, prosecutors said. After taking a job at Massachusetts-based Analog Devices in 2019, Sadeghi helped a Switzerland front company for Abedini's Iranian firm enter into a contract with Analog Devices and assisted Abedini in procuring U.S. technology, prosecutors said. The electronic components Abedini obtained included the same type used in the navigation system found in the drone, prosecutors said. Sadeghi has been detained since his arrest. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell set a Jan. 2 hearing to potentially grant his release after a defense lawyer reported progress in talks with prosecutors on acceptable bail conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/engineer-pleads-not-guilty-in-us-case-of-deadly-iran-linked-drone-strike/7916458.html	2024-12-27T14:06:23-08:00

VOA Mandarin: Why does Trump want to ‘take back’ Panama Canal?	President-elect Donald Trump is openly discussing aspirations for U.S. territorial expansion, including taking over the Panama Canal. Trump has yet to specify how he will demand the return of the state-run canal to the U.S. 'We will never, never let it fall into the wrong hands.' For many Chinese readers, the Panama Canal sounds familiar but remains unknown. Why does Trump think the U.S. can 'retake' the canal? Did it ever belong to the U.S.? What’s the history of the canal, and is it true China has a big influence in the country? VOA Mandarin explains.

Zimbabwe to work with Russia, IAEA to establish nuclear energy	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Russian investors to establish nuclear energy as part of its efforts to end the country’s chronic power shortages, government officials said Thursday. The nation has expressed its interest in nuclear power to the IAEA, said Edgar Moyo, minister of energy and power development, and hopes to develop small, modular reactors. 'They have indicated their willingness to take us through paces until we get there,' Moyo told journalists. Establishing nuclear power is expensive and complex, said Joseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, which is the reason countries such as South Africa and Egypt have sought Russia’s assistance. The process is also ripe for corruption, he said, so transparency is critical. 'Most economists would argue that those deals cost far more than are warranted for the benefits that they would provide to their economies and to their societies,' Siegle said, 'and so there's a worry that these huge infrastructure projects become a source of corruption, both in the country where it is being built, but also vis-a-vis the state-owned enterprises that the Russians provide to build the plant. 'In the end, it becomes the public in the country that is building the plant that would be responsible for paying off these costs,' he said. Zimbabwe says its goal is to have 4,000 megawatts of power capacity by 2035 and end years of power cuts that can sometimes last up to 18 hours per day. Siegle said Zimbabwe’s power needs do not warrant a traditional large-scale nuclear reactor and suggested that the government study the lasting impact of waste disposal. '[This] has always been a concern with nuclear energy — what you do with the waste, which requires some 10,000 years for the radioactive elements to decay and not pose a health risk to society,' he said. Nuclear power also heightens security risks, Siegle said. Gloria Magombo, secretary for energy and power development, said at the media briefing that Zimbabwe aims to increase the use of other renewable energies besides hydropower, given the nation’s recurring droughts. She mentioned solar, wind and mini-hydro stations. 'We are we are looking at coming in by 2030 with up to about 2,000 megawatts' from those sources, Magombo said. Zimbabwe's current capacity for power generation is about 2,600 megawatts, according to the government. The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-work-with-russia-iaea-to-establish-nuclear-energy/7916424.html	2024-12-27T13:26:35-08:00	
Taliban hint at shielding anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan as 'guests'	ISLAMABAD — A senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan has indicated that they will continue to provide refuge to anti-Pakistan militants, describing them as 'guests' under the country's traditions. Taliban Information Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa made the rare remarks just days after the Pakistani military reportedly conducted airstrikes against suspected terrorist locations in an eastern Afghan border province. The Taliban claimed that Tuesday's attack in Paktika resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 civilians, predominantly refugees from Pakistan. While the claims could not be verified from independent sources, the United Nations said that it had 'received credible reports' from the remote Afghan province that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in the Pakistani airstrikes. Islamabad has refrained from publicly acknowledging the cross-border strikes, but Pakistani security officials anonymously confirmed and told reporters that the military action had targeted and destroyed several 'terrorist hideouts' of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group engaged in lethal attacks against Pakistan. Several key TTP commanders were also said to be among more than a dozen militants killed. 'We must honor the Afghan nation's commitment to safeguarding these guests, friends,' an angry Khairkhwa said while denouncing the Pakistani attack. He was apparently referring to the TTP in his speech aired by Taliban-controlled state television and shared via X social media platform Friday. The Taliban minister emphasized the need for Pakistan 'to draw lessons from the consequences of military interventions' in Afghanistan by Britain, the former Soviet Union and the United States, respectively, since the 19th century. 'Anyone who attacks Afghanistan or harbors such intentions must learn from the defeat of three superpowers,' Khairkhwa asserted. This is the first public admission by a senior Taliban leader regarding the presence of TTP operatives in the country. Previously, Taliban officials have vehemently denied their existence, claiming that no foreign militants are permitted to operate and pose a threat to other nations from Afghan soil. TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, has escalated attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban's August 2021 resurgence to power in Kabul, killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians and security personnel. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his government's intention to enhance economic and trade relations with Afghanistan. However, he stated that the threat of TTP-led cross-border terrorism impedes that progress. 'Unfortunately, the TTP continues to operate from there and killing innocent people inside Pakistan. This cannot go on,' Sharif said in his televised remarks to a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad. 'They must rein in TTP. … This constitutes a red line for us. The TTP operating from Afghan soil is unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stressed. Sharif said his country was ready to talk with the Afghan government to address the issue. 'But there can be no progress if, on the one hand, they seek to foster relations with Pakistan while simultaneously permitting TTP to operate with impunity,' he emphasized. Separately, the Pakistani military reported Friday that its counterterrorism operations and clashes with TTP militants resulted in the killings of over 900 'terrorists' this year, including 27 Afghan suicide bombers and fighters. The violence also left nearly 400 Pakistani security forces and officers dead, said Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military spokesperson. Who is Khairkhwa? Khairkhwa, a U.N.-sanctioned Taliban leader, was captured by U.S. forces in collaboration with Pakistani counterparts in early 2002 and subsequently transferred to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison center. He was freed along with four other senior Taliban leaders in 2014 as part of a Qatar-mediated exchange for the release of U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, American and Western-allied forces invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government due to its refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who was accused of orchestrating the deadly attacks from his Afghan bases. The Taliban leadership at the time justified its refusal to surrender bin Laden, asserting that he was a 'guest' in the country and that surrendering him would violate local traditions. Subsequently, the Taliban regrouped and launched an insurgency against U.S.-led foreign forces, using sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. Bin Laden evaded capture and fled to Pakistan, where he was eventually tracked down and killed by American troops in 2011. Taliban leaders pledged to combat transnational militant networks to prevent them from using Afghanistan as a haven for global attacks after they seized power three years ago. However, an annual U.S. terrorism report released earlier this month cast doubts on Taliban counterterrorism commitments, citing TTP's growing attacks against Pakistan from Afghan sanctuaries and the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-hint-at-shielding-anti-pakistan-militants-in-afghanistan-as-guests-/7916430.html	2024-12-27T13:22:50-08:00	
NASA spacecraft 'safe' after closest-ever approach to sun	NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was 'safe' and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the sun by any human-made object. The spacecraft passed 6.1 million kilometers from the solar surface on Tuesday, flying into the sun's outer atmosphere — called the corona — on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth's closest star. The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday. The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on January 1, NASA added. Moving at up to 692,000 kilometers per hour the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 982 degrees Celsius, according to the NASA website. 'This close-up study of the sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,' the agency added. 'We're rewriting the textbooks on how the sun works with the data from this probe,' Dr. Joseph Westlake, NASA's heliophysics director, told Reuters. 'This mission was theorized in the fifties,' he said, adding that it is an 'amazing achievement to create technologies that let us delve into our understanding of how the sun operates.' The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer toward the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun. Westlake said the team is preparing for even more flybys in the extended mission phase, hoping to capture unique events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacecraft-safe-after-closest-ever-approach-to-sun-/7916419.html	2024-12-27T13:15:48-08:00	
Senate intelligence panel criticizes CIA response to Havana syndrome	A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Friday criticized the CIA's response to so-called Havana syndrome health problems among its workforce, saying many individuals 'faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care.' The report cast no new light on the causes of the headaches, nausea, memory lapses, dizziness and other ailments that were first reported by U.S. embassy officials in the Cuban capital Havana in 2016. A globe-spanning U.S. intelligence investigation concluded in March 2023 that it was very unlikely a foreign adversary was responsible for the ailments that afflicted some 1,500 U.S. diplomats, spies, other personnel and their families. It found the symptoms, reports of which peaked in 2021 and have since dramatically tapered off, likely resulted from pre-existing conditions, conventional illnesses and environmental and social factors. Commenting on the Senate findings, a CIA spokesperson said the agency had to respond to the 'vexing' health problems as it grappled with the pandemic, and worked with other agencies to determine if a foreign power was attacking U.S. personnel and their families. 'Whether, in hindsight, we could have done better is for others to evaluate, but our commitment to ensuring our officers and their families had access to the care they needed has never wavered,' the spokesperson said in a statement. The committee's report, the product of a year-long staff investigation, was largely based on hundreds of hours of testimony from CIA officials, other U.S. officials, medical personnel and those reporting symptoms, a panel statement said. The report's declassified summary said the unknown nature of anomalous health incidents (AHIs) complicated the CIA's response, which the agency first based on an assessment that an attack causing traumatic brain injuries was responsible. That assessment, the report said, changed with intelligence analyses leading to the 2023 intelligence community finding, and was one of several factors affecting how the agency provided medical care and other benefits to those reporting symptoms. The absence of a clear definition of AHIs, uncertainty about their origins and the CIA's 'evolving organizational structure' for dealing with the issue have 'greatly complicated CIA's ability to consistently and transparently facilitate medical care,' the report said. Those factors also complicated the agency's provision of compensation and other benefits to those reporting symptoms as well as its ability to communicate clearly about AHIs to its personnel, the report continued. The agency provided medical care in nearly '100 CIA-affiliated incidents, but many individuals faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care,' it said. In another finding, it said the agency provided benefits and compensation to many personnel but access to those programs has been inconsistent and affected by the way the CIA was organized to address the issue. The CIA stopped collecting clinical data on AHIs even though some clinical studies identified unexplained clusters of symptoms, the report said, adding that Pentagon research efforts continue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-intelligence-panel-criticizes-cia-response-to-havana-syndrome-/7916368.html	2024-12-27T12:17:55-08:00	
US sanctions founder of Georgia's ruling political party	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia's ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and toward Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chair Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties 'for undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,' according to a statement. The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the United States has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. The sanctions include freezes on assets and properties that those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families. 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream's actions under Ivanishvili's leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,' the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.' Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, the longtime ruling party. Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws like those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia's membership application process indefinitely. In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country's prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-founder-of-georgia-s-ruling-political-party/7916344.html	2024-12-27T12:05:58-08:00	
US homelessness up 18% as many in America cannot afford housing	The United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness this year, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country, federal officials said Friday. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department said federally required tallies taken across the country in January found that more than 770,000 people were counted as homeless — a number that misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. That increase comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population. 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe, and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on 'evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.' Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness — one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Colorado; Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year. Disasters increase homelessness Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count. 'Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,' Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. 'As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.' The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness. Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities — especially in Western states — have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don’t violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness. Homelessness among veterans drops There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024. 'The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,' Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. 'With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide.' Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, Texas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023. California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts. The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade. Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017. The numbers ticked up to about 580,000 in the 2020 count and held relatively steady over the next two years as Congress responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency rental assistance, stimulus payments, aid to states and local governments and a temporary eviction moratorium.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homelessness-up-18-as-many-in-america-cannot-afford-housing/7916304.html	2024-12-27T12:03:11-08:00	
Boat sinks en route to Spain, dozens killed, Malian minister says	BAMAKO, MALI — Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank as they tried to reach Spain earlier this month, Mali’s Minister for Malians Living Abroad said. In a press release Thursday, Mossa Ag Attaher announced that a migrant boat bound for Spain sank on Dec. 19. The migrants in this boat 'numbered 80 at the start, with only 11 survivors,' according to the Ministry. The Malian authorities have identified nine Malians among the survivors, and '25 young Malians have unfortunately been formally identified among the victims,' the minister added. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago is seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many of those making the journey come from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and other West African countries, seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. Several of the Malian victims are from the Kayes region in the west of the country, according to Doulaye Keita, adviser to the ministry, in a statement to the AP on Friday. 'Among the 25 Malians dead, there are 8 Malians from my commune,' Mamadou Siby, the mayor of the commune of Marena in the Kayes region, told The Associated Press. 'These dead young men left my commune seven months ago to work in the construction industry in Mauritania. Unfortunately, they were in contact with their friends in Europe and America, who encouraged them to come to these countries, and in most cases, they took the perilous journey without even informing their families back home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7916336.html	2024-12-27T11:57:22-08:00	
Massive Chinese espionage scheme hit 9th telecom firm, US says	WASHINGTON — A sprawling Chinese espionage campaign hacked a ninth U.S. telecom firm, a top White House official said Friday. The Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. The White House earlier this month said the attack affected at least eight telecommunications companies and dozens of nations. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday that a ninth victim was identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks. The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication. The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of 'a limited number of individuals.' Although the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose communications were accessed. Neuberger said officials did not yet have a precise sense of how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but a 'large number' were in or near Washington. Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were 'government targets of interest,' spy on their texts and phone calls, she said. The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are 'primarily involved in government or political activity.' Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. 'We know that voluntary cybersecurity practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,' she said. The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-chinese-espionage-scheme-hit-9th-telecom-firm-us-says/7916311.html	2024-12-27T11:42:32-08:00	
Montenegro approves extradition of cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon to US	PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO — Montenegro has approved the extradition of a South Korean mogul known as 'the cryptocurrency king' to the United States, the Balkan country's Justice Ministry said Friday. Minister Bojan Bozovic has issued a deposition allowing the handover of Do Kwon, the founder of the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs who was arrested in Montenegro last year, according to the ministry. It was not immediately clear when exactly Kwon would be sent to the U.S. The move follows a months-long legal saga in the case of Do Kwon. Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition and various courts in Montenegro over the past months have brought and overturned multiple rulings to extradite Kwon either to the U.S. or South Korea. The Justice Ministry statement cited the latest ruling of Montenegro's Supreme Court which said that conditions have been met for Kwon to be extradited to one of the two countries, and that the final decision lies with the justice minister. The ministry said Friday that more legal criteria were in favor of extradition to the U.S. Kwon’s lawyers in Montenegro said they learned about the decision from the media and that their client cannot be extradited until they receive the ruling. 'Behind such illegal behavior of the minister is the fact that the courts, on two occasions ... made a decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea,' lawyers Goran Rodić and Marija Radulović said in a statement. Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. He and another South Korean were arrested in Montenegro while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a 'stablecoin,' a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-approves-extradition-of-cryptocurrency-mogul-do-kwon-to-us-/7916310.html	2024-12-27T11:41:53-08:00	
Senegal to close foreign military bases, cuts ties to ex-colonial power France	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal has announced the closure of all foreign military bases, without setting a timeline for the exit of foreign troops. Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko made the announcement Friday during a general policy statement to the National Assembly. 'The president of the Republic has decided to close all foreign military bases in the very near future,' Sonko said. France's military and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to the announcement. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye last month expressed his desire to close the French bases in Senegal. 'Senegal is an independent country, it is a sovereign country, and sovereignty does not accommodate the presence of foreign military bases,' the head of state said in a rare media interview. This decision to close bases appears to be aimed primarily at France. A former colonial power in much of Africa, France has faced opposition from some African leaders over an alleged demeaning and heavy-handed approach to the continent. France, which has already left Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, on Thursday confirmed it had pulled its last troops out of the Faya base in Chad. France’s permanent military presence in Chad ″no longer met the expectations and interests of each party″ and described the withdrawal as part of a ″reconfiguration of its system in Africa″ since 2022, the military said. French officials have said that France aims to sharply reduce its presence at all its bases in Africa except Djibouti. That includes the 350 French troops in Senegal. France could instead provide defense training or targeted military support based on needs expressed by those countries, according to the officials. Senegal's new government, which has been in power for less than a year, has taken a hardline stance on the presence of French troops as part of a larger regional backlash against what many see as the legacy of an oppressive colonial empire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-to-close-foreign-military-bases-cuts-ties-to-ex-colonial-power-france/7916172.html	2024-12-27T10:08:37-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees return from Turkey	Nearly 31,000 Syrians have returned home since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Turkey’s interior minister said Friday. Turkey is home to nearly 3 million refugees who fled Syria after the start of the civil war in 2011. The recent fall of Assad’s government has raised hope that Syrian refugees in Turkey and elsewhere may be able to return. The return of Syrian refugees comes as Turkey says it will look to provide electricity to Syria and help enhance its power infrastructure, Turkey’s energy minister was quoted as saying on Friday. Assistance for Syria is coming from elsewhere, too. Some 50 tons of European Union-funded medical supplies that were flown to Turkey through Dubai are expected to enter Syria on Dec. 31, a United Nations health official told Agence France-Presse on Friday. 'The supplies are still in Istanbul and going through the customs process,' Mrinalini Santhanam of the World Health Organization’s Gaziantep office in southern Turkey told AFP. The goal is to support Syria’s healthcare system, which was pummeled by years of war under Assad. And Ukraine already has sent its first batch of food aid to Syria, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday. The Ukrainian leader said 500 tons of wheat flour were on their way to Syria. Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat warned Friday against 'destructive interference' in Syria’s future, he wrote in Chinese state media as he visited Beijing. Iran 'considers the decision-making about the future of Syria to be the sole responsibility of the people ... without destructive interference or foreign imposition,' Abbas Araghchi wrote in a Chinese-language article in the People’s Daily newspaper published on Friday. Both China and Iran were supporters of the now-deposed Assad. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-of-syrian-refugees-return-from-turkey-/7916193.html	2024-12-27T10:07:33-08:00	
Croatia's president seeks reelection, faces several contenders in Sunday's vote	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection this weekend against an array of contenders, including the candidate backed by the conservative government. President Zoran Milanovic is seen as a favorite ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, although he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanovic served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. The continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene. Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenkovic's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party, has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive. Although the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanovic has criticized the European Union's support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, although it is a member of NATO and the EU. Milanovic has also blocked Croatia's participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'No Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia's place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. Political expert Andjelko Milardovic said Milanovic’s reelection would be good for democracy in Croatia because the ruling party holds a tight grip over all other government institutions. 'We are interested to see a balance and control of power,' said Milardovic. Milanovic is backed by center-left Social Democrats, the biggest opposition party. Some analysts believe that Marija Selak Raspudic, a conservative independent candidate polling third in pre-election surveys, could stand a better chance against Milanovic if she somehow makes it to the runoff. Selak Raspudic was close to a right-wing party in the past but now runs as nonpartisan. She has focused on economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Trailing fourth in the polls is the only left-green contender in the race, Ivana Kekin, from the Mozemo, or We Can, party, which governs Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Married to a popular rock musician, Kekin says she is a 'president for a new generation.' As a psychiatrist, Kekin has accused Primorac and HDZ of syphoning money from Croatia's health system in shady corruption deals. Four more candidates are running, but none are believed to stand a chance to reach the second round. Zagreb resident Ilka Matic said that she expects Milanovic to win another five-year mandate but that 'there is little difference between them all.' Croatia, the newest member state of the EU after joining the bloc in 2013, has around 1.6 million eligible voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-s-president-seeks-reelection-faces-several-contenders-in-sunday-s-vote/7916158.html	2024-12-27T09:53:24-08:00	
Israeli forces raid northern Gaza hospital	Israeli forces raided the Kamal Adwan hospital on Friday, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, burning large sections and forcing dozens of patients and hundreds of others to leave, officials said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it had lost contact with staff inside the hospital in the northern city of Beit Lahiya. 'The occupation forces are inside the hospital now and they are burning it,' Ministry Director Munir al-Bursh said in a statement. The Israeli military said it launched the operation to target Hamas militants near the hospital. The military said in a statement the hospital had become 'a key stronghold for terrorist organizations and continues to be used as a hideout for terrorist operatives.' Since the war began between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Israeli military has frequently accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces. Hamas has rejected those accusations. Without providing specific details, the Israeli military said it had tried to mitigate harm to civilians and had 'facilitated the secure evacuations of civilians, patients and medical personnel prior to the operation.' The hospital has been under intense pressure from Israeli forces for weeks. 'The world must understand that our hospital is being targeted with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside,' Hossam Abu Safiyeh, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said in a statement Monday. The hospital announced Thursday that five of its staff members, including a pediatrician, had been killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli military said it was not aware of a strike at the hospital and that the report of the deaths would be examined. The World Health Organization has characterized conditions at the hospital as 'appalling' and said it was operating at a 'minimum' level. Hamas said Israeli forces had stormed the hospital Friday. 'The occupation army stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, forcing medical staff, patients, the wounded, and displaced people to evacuate it,' the militant group said in a statement. Hamas also accused Israeli forces of isolating and detaining those evacuated. 'Hamas holds the occupation fully responsible for the lives of patients, wounded, and medical staff after they were cut off from communication, arrested, and taken to an unknown location,' the militant group added. The war was triggered by Hamas’ terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli data. Israel’s subsequent campaign against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, according to health officials in the territory. An additional 108,000 people have been wounded, the health ministry said. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. The majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced as they continue to face threats of famine. The enclave itself is in ruins. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-raid-northern-gaza-hospital-/7916008.html	2024-12-27T08:42:18-08:00	
Protests, traffic blockades keep up in Serbia over concrete canopy fall	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbian university students left piles of old schoolbooks outside the Education Ministry building Friday as part of almost daily street protests demanding accountability over the collapse nearly two months ago of a concrete canopy that killed 15 people in the country's north. Scattered traffic blockades were also held on various locations throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m. — the time that the concrete construction on the front of the railway station building in Novi Sad crashed onto the people below. Traffic blockades have been held every Friday since the Nov. 1 crash, lasting 15 minutes for the 15 victims. Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad, which was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Persistent protests in Serbia reflect widespread anger at the accident but also wider discontent with the rule of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Tens of thousands of people joined a rally Sunday in Belgrade led by the university students. Prosecutors arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation. Striking university students have garnered support from various walks of life, challenging the tight grip on power by Vucic's government. The movement's symbol — a red handprint telling authorities they have blood on their hands — has been used by actors, farmers and others backing the protests. In Belgrade, more than 2,000 students marched to the Education Ministry. A speaker told the crowd that 'we are sick of being called political mercenaries and attacked in the streets.' In Novi Sad, a student rally criticized the way the state-run RT Vojvodina reports about the protests and the canopy collapse. Populist officials and the pro-government mainstream media have described the protests as a 'hybrid war' against Vucic under the orders of foreign intelligence services. Though Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them. University students in neighboring Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, and the northwestern town of Banja Luka on Friday gathered in support of their Serbian colleagues and to draw attention to problems in their own country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-traffic-blockades-keep-up-in-serbia-over-concrete-canopy-fall/7916060.html	2024-12-27T08:33:05-08:00	
Slovakia confirms it can host Ukraine-Russia peace talks	Slovakia on Friday confirmed its readiness to host peace talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is open to a Slovak proposal to host peace talks with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in February of 2022. 'We offer Slovak soil for such negotiations,' Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said on Facebook. Blanar also said any talks must take place with all parties participating, including Russia. Russian officials were not present for previous talks in June in Switzerland. 'We consider the statement of the Russian president as a positive signal to end this war, this bloodshed and this destruction as soon as possible,' Blanar said. The foreign minister said Slovakia, a European Union and NATO member, told Ukraine in October about its availability to host peace talks. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico is one of just a few European leaders who have remained close with Moscow. He prompted an angry reaction from Ukraine when he met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22. Fico also has halted all Slovakian military aid to Ukraine, and he has accused Ukraine of threatening Slovakia’s supply of Russian gas. Also on Friday, the Ukrainian air force said its air defense shot down 13 of 24 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack. The air force said the other 11 Russian drones were 'lost' without causing damage. That comes as Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Friday that its forces had taken control of two eastern Ukrainian villages, according to the RIA state news agency. The ministry identified the villages as Ivanivka in the Donetsk region and Zahryzove in the Kharkiv region. VOA could not verify the Russian report. Some information in this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/slovakia-confirms-it-can-host-ukraine-russia-peace-talks/7916071.html	2024-12-27T08:32:08-08:00	
Brazil views labor violations at BYD site as human 'trafficking'	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Authorities in Brazil said Friday they are probing Chinese auto giant BYD and one of its contractors for suspected 'trafficking' of Chinese workers building a factory in the South American country. Federal prosecutors in Brazil are weighing possible criminal action after labor inspectors found 163 Chinese workers 'in slave-like conditions' at the construction site in the northeast state of Bahia, a government statement said. The workers, employed by BYD contractor Jinjiang Open Engineering, were viewed as 'victims of international trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation,' said the statement. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing, Mao Ning, said: 'We have noted the relevant reports... and are currently verifying the situation.' She added that Beijing 'attaches great importance to protecting laborers' legitimate rights and interests, and has always required Chinese enterprises to operate in line with the law and regulations.' On Thursday, BYD and Jinjiang were quizzed by Brazilian government ministries, which said 'the companies committed to collaborate in protecting the rescued workers.' Allegations denied Brazilian officials on Monday said it had found the labor violations at the site, which is being built to be BYD's largest electric car plant outside of Asia. Bahia's regional ministry for works (MPT) ordered construction be suspended at part of the site. Inspections carried out since November found 'degrading working conditions' at the site, including beds in workers' accommodation lacking mattresses, and one bathroom per 31 workers, an MPT statement said. The workers, who spent long hours under Brazil's sun, had 'visible signs of skin damage,' the statement said. The MPT added that it suspected 'forced labor,' with workers' passports confiscated and their employer 'retaining 60 percent of their salary.' After the allegations were made public, BYD's Brazilian subsidiary said it had broken its contract with the Jinjiang subsidiary responsible for work on the site. It added that it had sent the 163 workers to stay in hotels. Jinjiang on Thursday — in a statement issued before the online hearing with Brazilian authorities — denied the slavery allegation. The company said the accusations 'seriously damaged the dignity of Chinese people' and claimed it 'made our staff feel seriously insulted and that their human rights have been violated.' A Jinjiang representative told AFP on Friday that the company would hold a press conference in Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-views-labor-violations-at-byd-site-as-human-trafficking-/7916009.html	2024-12-27T08:02:00-08:00	
Chad opposition, civil society vow to disrupt Sunday elections	Yaounde — Tensions continue to mount in Chad, with opposition and so-called civil society groups vowing to disrupt Sunday’s local council, regional and parliamentary elections. The groups say the polls will be rigged to favor current President Mahamat Idriss Deby, and are visiting towns and villages warning people to stay home to avoid possible street violence. Chadians in the country’s capital, N'djamena, say uncertainty looms in the central African state ahead of elections slated to take place Sunday. Twenty-three-year old Limana Abba, a student at the university of N'djamena, told VOA via a messaging app Friday that opponents of the elections have been visiting neighborhoods to warn people against voting. He says he is not sure he and a majority of registered voters will be able to vote because opposition and civil society groups have increased threats to attack those who vote on Sunday. In Chad, civil society groups are associations authorized to help with the country's governance, human rights and democratic process. It’s not clear if the groups threatening violence Sunday qualify as civil society under that definition. In any case, Limana has concerns about whether the military and police can protect voters, candidates and election officials, despite pledges from the government to do so. Chadian officials told state TV this week that government troops and police have been deployed to safeguard civilians and their property, and to stop what the government calls the possible use of weapons by disgruntled civilians. Ahead of the vote, political parties and aligned groups have been holding daily campaigns against the elections. Soumaine Adoum, the spokesperson of Wakit Tama, a coalition of over a hundred groups, spoke to a press conference in N'djamena Thursday. He said civilians do not trust Deby, who wants to continue his father, Idriss Deby Itno's roughly 30-year rule at all costs. He added all Chadians should stay at home on Sunday as a sign of protest against the armed conflicts, corruption, abuses of press freedom, suffocation of liberties and democracy, and illegal arrests and detention of opposition and civil society members that have characterized Deby's rule. Soumaine said the Elections Management Body, ANGE, cannot claim the elections will be free, fair and credible when Deby is preparing to use government troops to stuff ballot boxes as he did during the central country’s May 6 presidential election. Deby and ANGE denied the presidential election was rigged, and ANGE has always claimed it organizes free, fair and transparent elections free of government intervention. The elections management body is asking civilians to brave the threats and contribute to the country's development by taking part in Sunday’s polls. Scores of opposition and civil society members have been arrested ahead of the polls. Government officials say police called in several dozen people for questioning this week because of complaints from Deby's ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement that their campaign teams were attacked and election materials destroyed. Sunday’s local, regional and parliamentary elections were organized to mark an end to Chad's three-year transition period after the death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno in April 2021. The legislative elections are aimed at restoring the 188-member National Assembly that was dissolved in April 2021 when the army took power. Officials say government troops will vote Saturday, before the general voting, then be on alert to intervene in case of violence when civilians vote Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-civil-society-vow-to-disrupt-sunday-elections-/7915943.html	2024-12-27T07:35:45-08:00	
How sisterhood of writers helped Afghan women through Taliban takeover	WASHINGTON — Marie Bamyani was in a taxi in Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021, when she learned that the Taliban had entered the Afghan capital. 'I felt like a glass that breaks at once,' said Bamyani, who is now 29. At the time, Bamyani worked with a German aid organization. She said she was too young in the 1990s to remember much about the previous period of Taliban rule. The only thing that came to her mind were horrific images in the media of the Taliban executing a woman in a soccer stadium in the late '90s. For her, the return of the Taliban meant 'death for Afghan women.' The Taliban quickly imposed repressive measures against women. In a state of shock, Bamyani remembers not daring to step outside of her house for weeks. 'I was feeling numb,' she told VOA. The only thing she did was share her experience in a WhatsApp chat group with 20 other women. Those messages, collected over that first year of Taliban rule and translated into English from Dari and Pashto, are now published as a diary in the book, My Dear Kabul. Published in 2024 in Britain, the book captures firsthand the changes to women's freedoms seen in the first year, and for some, their thoughts watching the situation in Afghanistan from overseas. For Bamyani, she continued contributing to the chat group even after being evacuated to Germany in October of that year. 'We just shared our feelings about the situation in the country,' she said, adding that they never thought the messages would one day be a book. The women were part of a writer development program, started in 2019 by Untold Narratives. At the time of the takeover, they were preparing to release a separate book, My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird. That book, released in 2022, is a collection of short fiction stories, written by Afghan women. Lucy Hannah, the founder of Untold Narratives and a coeditor of My Dear Kabul, told VOA that the WhatsApp messages were collected at the writers' request. 'It is important to hear from women's voices,' said Hannah. It is also important to hear 'from voices that are not necessarily journalists, that are working people whose lives are directly affected by what is going around them who also happen to be creative writers.' She said that the 21 contributors, ages 22 to 65, were from different ethnic groups. Another contributor, Fatima Saadat, told VOA that she and the women in the chat wanted a safe place to share, without hesitation, 'what came to their mind at that moment.' Saadat left Kabul a week before the fall of Kabul, to start on her master's degree in women's and gender studies as a Fulbright scholar in the U.S. 'I couldn't believe that in a few days after I left, something like that would happen,' she said. 'I wanted to know how the girls [in the group] were doing.' Saadat said it was 'an act of courage' that these women posted what they were feeling and experiencing. 'This encouraged me when I read their messages, and I started [sharing] my feelings while in the U.S.,' she said. 'As a woman, my fear was about my human rights, women's rights,' she said. 'The return of the Taliban meant the return of conflict, horror and backwardness to Afghanistan.' It is painful when one can't get an education, leave the house, and make choices in life, said Saadat. 'Your life becomes a prison.' Since the August 2021 takeover, the Taliban have imposed rules and regulations on women and girls: They are barred from secondary and university education, working with the government and non-government organizations, traveling long distances without being accompanied by a male relative, and going to public baths and restaurants. But, Saadat said, 'Writing is the thing that the Taliban can't take away from us.' Other Afghan female writers have welcomed the book's release. Parvin Malal, who writes poetry and fiction about women, conflict and refugees, told VOA it is important for Afghan women to write about their experiences. Writing helps people when 'going through crises and dealing with mental issues,' said Malal, who is originally from Kandahar. In a December report, Rawadari, an Afghanistan-focused rights group based outside the country, found deterioration of mental health and an increase in suicide attempts and child and forced marriages among girls in Afghanistan. 'As a result of the ban on women's education, violence against women increased, which has made life difficult for girls and women' in Afghanistan, the report said. For Bamyani, she believes the current situation in Afghanistan will not remain the same. 'I am optimistic and hopeful that it will not be forever, but I hope that people inside Afghanistan will not suffer for long,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-sisterhood-of-writers-helped-afghan-women-through-taliban-takeover-/7915973.html	2024-12-27T07:24:46-08:00

Ukrainian drone attack was under way before Azerbaijani plane crash, Russian aviation chief says	Russia's aviation chief said Friday that a Ukrainian drone attack was under way in the region of Chechnya at the time an Azerbaijani airliner attempted to land before diverting to Kazakhstan and crashing there earlier this week. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, didn’t comment on statements by an Azerbaijani lawmaker and many aviation experts who blamed Wednesday’s crash on Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, but it turned to Aktau in Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea and crashed while making an attempt to land there. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Authorities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia were tight-lipped about a possible cause of the crash pending an official probe, but a member of Azerbaijan's parliament, Rasim Musabekov told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan on Thursday that the plane was fired on while in the skies over Grozny and urged Russia to offer an official apology. Asked about Musabekov's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 'The air incident is being investigated, and we don't believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Yadrov, the Russian aviation chief, said that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny, prompting authorities to close the area for air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land in Grozny, he was offered other airports as an alternative but decided to fly to Aktau across the Caspian Sea. 'The situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult,' he said in a statement. 'There are many circumstances that it's necessary to investigate jointly.' Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the crash probe, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. As the official crash probe started, some aviation experts pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. FlightRadar24 said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' that interfered with flight tracking data. Russia has extensively used sophisticated jamming equipment to fend off drone attacks. Following Wednesday's suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaiajan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to more Russian cities, cutting air links to Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara. It said in a statement that the flights will be suspended 'following the preliminary results of the investigation into the crash of the Embraer 190 aircraft operating flight J2-8243 from Baku to Grozny, caused by physical and technical interference, and considering potential risks to flight safety.' The company will continue to operate flights to six other Russian cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstan's Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. The day before, Israeli El Al suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing 'developments in Russia’s airspace.' The airline said it would reassess the situation next week to decide whether to resume the flights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drone-attack-was-under-way-before-azerbaijani-plane-crash-russian-aviation-chief-says-/7915869.html	2024-12-27T06:39:26-08:00	
Driver who killed 35 in China car ramming sentenced to death	Beijing — A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai last month was sentenced to death on Friday, state media reported. On November 11, 62-year-old Fan Weiqiu deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV, the worst attack in China since 2014. He was detained at the scene with self-inflicted knife injuries and fell into a coma, police said at the time. His case was publicly tried on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, with the verdict reached on the same day. The court said the defendant's motives 'were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society,' state media said. In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added. The court found Fan had 'decided to vent his anger' over 'a broken marriage, personal frustrations, and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce,' the report said. China has this year seen a string of mass casualty incidents — from stabbings to car attacks — challenging its reputation for good public security. Some analysts have linked the incidents to growing anger and desperation at the country's slowing economy and a sense that society is becoming more stratified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-who-killed-35-in-china-car-ramming-sentenced-to-death-/7915802.html	2024-12-27T05:24:27-08:00	
China sanctions 7 companies over US military assistance to Taiwan	BEIJING — The Chinese government placed sanctions on seven companies on Friday in response to recent U.S. announcements of military sales and aid to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory. The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said 'includes multiple negative sections on China.' China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense. The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that 'relevant senior executives' of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any. Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved. The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries. Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the 'so-called' threat from China to justify increased military spending. 'U.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,' he said at a press conference. 'This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.' The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China's domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sanctions-7-companies-over-us-military-assistance-to-taiwan/7915788.html	2024-12-27T05:17:03-08:00	
NATO to boost military presence in Baltic after cables 'sabotage'	Brussels — NATO will bolster its military presence in the Baltic Sea after the suspected sabotage of an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia this week, the Western military alliance's chief Mark Rutte said on Friday. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 submarine cable that carries electricity from Finland to Estonia was disconnected from the grid, just over a month after two telecommunications cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic. Finnish authorities on Thursday said they were investigating the oil tanker, Eagle S, that sailed from a Russian port, as part of a probe for 'aggravated sabotage.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday: 'We've got the situation under control, and we have to continue to work together vigilantly to make sure that our critical infrastructure is not damaged by outsiders.' Officials suspect the tanker is part of the Russian 'shadow fleet', which refers to ships that transport Russian crude and oil products embargoed due to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Eagle S vessel, which flies under the flag of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, was en route to Port Said in Egypt. Police suspect that the oil tanker's anchor might have damaged the power cable. Rutte said he spoke to President Stubb about Finland's probe, adding in a post on X: 'I expressed my full solidarity and support. NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur earlier on Friday said on X that the country began naval patrols to protect the undersea cable supplying electricity from Finland. In a separate statement he said Tallinn wanted to send a clear message it was ready to protect its power connections with Finland with military and non-military means. Rutte on Thursday promised NATO support to Estonia and Finland, and condemned attacks on critical infrastructure after speaking to Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal. More EU sanctions The European Union has also threatened further sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet after this week's incident. The bloc's 27 member states agreed earlier this month to blacklist around 50 more oil tankers from Russia's shadow fleet used to circumvent Western sanctions, taking the number targeted to around 80. Ukraine's international backers have looked to curb funds going to the Kremlin's war machine by imposing a price cap and restrictions on Russia's key oil exports. To skirt the measures, Russia has resorted to using a so-called 'shadow fleet' of often ageing vessels that operate under dubious ownership or without proper insurance. Tensions have mounted around the Baltic since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship. On November 17 and 18 this year, sections of two telecom cables were cut in Swedish territorial waters. Suspicions have been directed at the Yi Peng 3, which according to ship tracking sites had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-to-boost-military-presence-in-baltic-after-cables-sabotage-/7915778.html	2024-12-27T05:03:37-08:00	
Germany's president dissolves parliament, sets national election for Feb. 23	FRANKFURT, Germany — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition. Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-president-dissolves-parliament-sets-national-election-for-feb-23-/7915727.html	2024-12-27T03:50:30-08:00	
Israel says struck 'infrastructure' on Syria-Lebanon border	Jerusalem — The Israeli military reported it conducted air strikes on Friday targeting 'infrastructure' on the Syrian-Lebanese border near the village of Janta, which it said was used to smuggle weapons to the armed group Hezbollah. 'Earlier today, the IAF [Israeli air force] struck infrastructure that was used to smuggle weapons via Syria to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon at the Janta crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border,' the military said in a statement. It did not specify whether the strikes were on the Syrian or Lebanese side, but they came a day after Lebanon's army accused Israel of 'violation of the ceasefire agreement by attacking Lebanese sovereignty and destroying southern towns and villages.' There is no official crossing point near Janta but the area is known for illegal crossings. The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, has also expressed concern over 'continuing destruction' caused by Israeli forces in south Lebanon. The Israeli military said Friday's strikes were aimed at preventing weapons falling into the hands of Hezbollah, with whom it fought a land and air war for more than a year until a ceasefire was agreed upon last month. 'These strikes are an additional part of the IDF's [Israeli military's] effort to target weapons smuggling operations from Syria into Lebanon, and prevent Hezbollah from re-establishing weapons smuggling routes,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the state of Israel in accordance with the understandings in the ceasefire agreement.' The truce went into effect on November 27, about two months after Israel stepped up its bombing campaign and later sent troops into Lebanon following nearly a year of exchanges of cross-border fire initiated by Hezbollah over the war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-struck-infrastructure-on-syria-lebanon-border-/7915712.html	2024-12-27T03:33:47-08:00	
Houthis claim new attacks on Israel after strikes hit Yemen airport	Sanaa — Yemeni rebels claimed a strike against the airport in Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv on Friday, after Israeli air strikes hit rebel-held Sanaa's international airport and other targets in Yemen. The Israeli strikes on Thursday landed as the head of the UN's World Health Organization said he and his team were preparing to fly out from Yemen's Houthi rebel-held capital. Hours later on Friday, the Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion airport and launched drones at Tel Aviv as well as a ship in the Arabian Sea. No other details were immediately available. Yemen's civil aviation authority said the airport planned to reopen on Friday after the strikes that it said occurred while the UN aircraft 'was getting ready for its scheduled flight.' The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was there. Israel's attack came a day after the Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed the firing of a missile and two drones at Israel. Yemen's Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel since late November when a ceasefire took effect between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Lebanon's Hezbollah. The Houthis Al-Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes killed six people, after earlier Houthi statements said two people died at the rebel-held capital's airport, and another at Ras Issa port. The strikes targeting the airport, military facilities and power stations in rebel areas marked the second time since December 19 that Israel has hit targets in Yemen after rebel missile fire towards Israel. In his latest warning to the rebels, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Yemenis depend on aid UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the 'escalation' in hostilities between Israel and the Houthis and called the Sanaa airport strikes 'especially alarming.' He said bombing transportation infrastructure posed a threat to humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population is dependent on aid. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of UN staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He said he and other UN staff were about to board their flight when 'the airport came under aerial bombardment.' 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged,' Tedros said on X, adding that he and United Nations staff were safe. A witness told AFP that 'more than six' attacks struck the rebel-held capital's airport, with raids also targeting the adjacent Al-Dailami air base. A series of strikes also targeted a power station in Hodeida, on the rebel-held coast, a witness and Al-Masirah TV said. Following rebel attacks against Israel, Israeli strikes had already twice this year hit Hodeida, a major entry point for humanitarian aid to impoverished Yemen, which has been ravaged for years by its own war. On December 19, after the rebels fired a missile towards Israel and badly damaged a school, Israel for the first time struck targets in Sanaa. It said the strikes were against ports and energy infrastructure that 'effectively contributed to' Houthi military actions. Houthi media said those strikes killed nine people. In the latest attacks, the Israeli military said its 'fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes on military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime.' 'Iranian weapons' The targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida, as well as other facilities at Hodeida, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports, an Israeli statement said. The targets were used by Houthis 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. Iran's foreign ministry condemned Israel's strikes as a 'clear violation of international peace and security and an undeniable crime against the heroic and noble people of Yemen.' Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose top leaders Israel has killed during the war in the Gaza Strip, condemned the attack as an 'aggression' against its 'brothers from Yemen.' Almost a week ago, on December 21, Israel's military and emergency services said a projectile fired from Yemen wounded 16 people in Israel's commercial center, Tel Aviv. The Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at Israel since the Gaza war began in October last year, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. They have similarly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, waters vital to world trade. Scores of drone and missile attacks on cargo ships have prompted reprisal strikes against Houthi targets by U.S. and sometimes British forces. In July, a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting the first Israeli retaliation on Hodeida. The Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing the capital and ousting the internationally recognized government in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition in March 2015 began a military campaign to dislodge them that was unsuccessful, despite what the Yemen Data Project, an independent tracker, said were more than 25,000 coalition air raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-claim-new-attacks-on-israel-after-strikes-hit-yemen-airport-/7915693.html	2024-12-27T03:18:43-08:00	
Estonia's navy to protect Baltic Sea power link after cable damage	STOCKHOLM — Estonia's armed forces have launched a naval operation to protect the Estlink 1 undersea power cable in the Baltic Sea in response to the damage this week of a parallel electricity line, Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on Friday. Finland on Thursday seized a ship carrying Russian oil on suspicion the vessel caused an outage of the Estlink 2 undersea power cable which, like Estlink 1, connects Finland and Estonia, and that it also damaged four internet lines. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert for acts of sabotage following a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, although subsea equipment is also subject to technical malfunction and accidents. Damage to subsea installations in the region has now become so frequent that it is difficult to believe this was caused merely by accident or poor seamanship, Tsahkna said on Thursday. Finnish investigators believe the seized ship -- the Cook Island-registered ship, named as the Eagle S -- may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, one of several such incidents in recent years. 'If there is a threat to the critical undersea infrastructure in our region, there will also be a response,' Tsahkna said on social media X. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 in operation between the two countries, operators Fingrid and Elering have said. Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Friday that the Baltic country had despatched a patrol ship, the Raju, to the waters where the Estlink 1 runs, and that the country hoped NATO allies would also deploy ships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-s-navy-to-protect-baltic-sea-power-link-after-cable-damage/7915662.html	2024-12-27T02:15:28-08:00	
Seoul: North Korean soldier captured in Russia-Ukraine war dies	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A North Korean soldier who was captured while fighting in Russia's war against Ukraine has died of his wounds, South Korea's spy agency said Friday. Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russia's military, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August. One of those North Korean soldiers was captured alive by the Ukrainian army on Thursday, a South Korean intelligence source told AFP, adding that the location where he was seized was not known. Hours later, Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that the soldier had succumbed to his wounds. 'It has been confirmed through an allied intelligence agency that the North Korean soldier captured alive on December 26th has just passed away due to worsening wounds,' the South's spy agency said in a statement. Friday's confirmation came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been 'killed or wounded' so far as they joined Russian troops in combat. South Korea's intelligence service had previously put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 1,000, saying the high casualty rate could be down to an unfamiliar battlefield environment and their lack of capability to counter drone attacks. Pyongyang's soldiers were also being 'utilized as expendable front-line assault units,' lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun said, speaking last week after a briefing by South Korea's spy agency. 'Dangerous expansion' North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A landmark defense pact between Pyongyang and Moscow signed in June came into force this month, with Russian President Vladimir Putin hailing it as a 'breakthrough document.' North Korean state media said Friday that Putin sent a New Year's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying 'the bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang.' Ukraine's allies have called Pyongyang's growing involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine a 'dangerous expansion' of the conflict. Seoul's military believes that North Korea was seeking to modernize its conventional warfare capabilities through combat experience gained in the Russia-Ukraine war. NATO chief Mark Rutte had also said that Moscow was providing support to Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs in exchange for the troops. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Monday that Pyongyang is reportedly 'preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers' and supplying '240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery' to the Russian army. Pyongyang's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine had prompted warnings from Seoul. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, said in November that Seoul was 'not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons' to Ukraine, which would mark a major shift to a long-standing policy barring the sale of weapons to countries in active conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seoul-north-korean-soldier-captured-in-russia-ukraine-war-dies/7915658.html	2024-12-27T02:05:27-08:00	
South Korean lawmakers impeach acting President Han Duck-soo	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean lawmakers impeached the acting president on Friday, as the country struggles to shake off political turmoil sparked by his predecessor's martial law declaration that shocked the world. Han Duck-soo took over as acting president from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended following a parliamentary vote over his move to impose martial law on Dec. 3. However, opposition MPs demanded Han, who is also prime minister, be removed from office as well, arguing that he had refused demands to complete Yoon's impeachment process and to bring him to justice. 'I announce that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo's impeachment motion has passed. Out of the 192 lawmakers who voted, 192 voted to impeach,' said National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik. Counting for the impeachment was delayed as ruling People's Power Party (PPP) lawmakers protested in parliament after Woo said only a simple majority was needed in the 300-member parliament to proceed with the impeachment. PPP lawmakers began chanting angrily and many rushed towards Woo, demanding that he resign. They did not take part in the vote. It became the second impeachment of a South Korean head of state in just two weeks, adding to the turmoil of the country's dynamic political landscape. It was also South Korea's first impeachment of an acting president. PPP leader Kweon Seong-dong said after the vote that Han 'must continue to lead state affairs without yielding to the opposition's passage of the impeachment motion.' However, Han said in a statement after the vote that he 'respects the parliament's decision' and would wait for the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision whether to uphold it. The opposition said in its impeachment motion that Han was 'intentionally avoiding the special investigation to probe those involved in the insurrection and has clearly stated his intention to reject the appointments of three Constitutional Court judges.' Such actions, it said, were 'in violation of a public official's duty to uphold the law... and serve the public.' Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will step in as acting president in Han's place. Choi had pleaded with the opposition lawmakers not to go ahead with the motion. 'An impeachment motion against the acting authority is no different from an impeachment motion against the entire Cabinet,' he told a news conference with other Cabinet members earlier on Friday. 'Our economy and people's livelihoods, which are walking on thin ice in a national emergency, cannot bear the expansion of political uncertainty surrounding the acting authority,' he said. 'True colors' At the heart of the current row is the composition of the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to uphold parliament's decision to impeach Yoon and now Han. The court is currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon. The opposition wanted Han to approve three more nominees to fill the nine-member bench, which he had refused to do, leaving both sides in deadlock. Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges 'revealed his true colors,' said Democratic Party lawmaker Jo Seoung-lae. The refusal 'is a direct challenge to the Constitution and the law,' said Jo. They sought to impeach Han to 'restore constitutional order and stabilize state affairs.' Han had said he wanted his PPP and the opposition to reach a compromise on the nominees. 'The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,' Han argued. 'A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached,' the 75-year-old career bureaucrat said. The Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday despite the latest controversy. Yoon's legal team said they would attend a preparatory hearing of the court's impeachment trial at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). The South Korean won plummeted to 1480.2 per U.S. dollar on Friday morning, marking its lowest level in nearly 16 years. The won earlier plunged to a two-year low against the dollar after the declaration of martial law as investors, already concerned about the state of Asia's number four economy, shunned the currency. Police said on Friday that they had begun a raid on a presidential safe house and were collecting footage from nearby security cameras as part of the martial law probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-lawmakers-impeach-acting-president-han-duck-soo/7915650.html	2024-12-27T01:53:26-08:00	
Japan approves record budget for aging population, defense	TOKYO — Japan's government on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, ramping up spending on social welfare as the population ages, and defense to tackle regional threats. The $730 billion budget for the year from April 2025, approved by the Cabinet, includes $55 billion in defense spending. It also includes social security spending of around 38.3 trillion yen -- up from 37.7 trillion the previous year. The defense ministry said in a briefing document that Japan was facing its 'toughest and most complex security environment' since World War II, repeating a warning from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japan has a pacifist post-war constitution, which limits its military capacity to ostensibly defensive measures. But it updated key security and defense policies in 2022, explicitly outlining the challenge posed by China, and committed to double its defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP by 2027. The $55 billion approved Friday will help pay for measures to help attract recruits to Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and to improve relations between the U.S. and Japanese militaries with locals in Okinawa. It will also go towards a system to collect satellite information on ballistic missiles, such as those fired by North Korea, and the movement of vessels in waters around Japan, including territories disputed with China. 'Strengthening our defense capabilities is something we're actively working on,' Ishiba said at an event organized by the Yomiuri newspaper on Thursday. 'Now matter how great our military tanks or vehicles are, it's pointless if we don't have enough people to move them,' said the prime minister, who has pledged to fix a shortage of new troops. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. Japan is one of the world's oldest societies, and this year the proportion of its people aged 65 or overreached a record 29.3%. The draft budget needs to be approved by the parliament, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito will need cooperation from opposition parties, having lost their majority in an October snap election. Ishiba has stayed on as prime minister despite leading the coalition to its worst general election result in 15 years. A vote to elect parliament's upper house will be held in summer 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-record-budget-for-aging-population-defense/7915608.html	2024-12-26T22:21:33-08:00	
Seoul: North Korean soldier captured in Russia-Ukraine war	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that a North Korean soldier sent to back Russia's war against Ukraine had been captured by Ukrainian forces. Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russian troops, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August. 'Through real-time information sharing with an allied country's intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured,' South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in a statement. The soldier was captured by the Ukrainian army, an intelligence source told AFP, adding that the location where he was seized was unknown. The first confirmation of the capture of a North Korean soldier came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been 'killed or wounded' so far. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff also said Monday that more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded. The JCS had also said that Pyongyang is reportedly 'preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers' and supplying '240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery' to the Russian army.

Richard Parsons, prominent Black executive at Time Warner, Citigroup, dies at 76	NEW YORK — Richard Parsons, one of corporate America's most prominent Black executives who held top posts at Time Warner and Citigroup, died Thursday. He was 76. Parsons, who died at his Manhattan home, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and cited 'unanticipated complications' from the disease for cutting back on work a few years later. The financial services company Lazard, where Parsons was a longtime board member, confirmed his death. David Zaslav, the president and CEO of Time Warner successor Warner Bros. Discovery, remembered Parsons as a 'great mentor and friend' and a 'tough and brilliant negotiator, always looking to create something where both sides win.' 'All who got a chance to work with him and know him saw that unusual combination of great leadership with integrity and kindness,' Zaslav said, calling him 'one of the great problem solvers this industry has ever seen.' Parsons' friend Ronald Lauder told The New York Times that the cause of death was cancer. Parsons stepped down on December 3 from the boards of Lazard and Lauder's company, Estee Lauder, citing health reasons. He had been on Estee Lauder's board for 25 years. Parsons, a Brooklyn native who started college at 16, was named chairman of Citigroup in 2009, one month after leaving Time Warner Inc., where he helped restore the company's stature following its much-maligned acquisition by internet provider America Online Inc. He steered Citigroup back to profit after financial turmoil from the subprime mortgage crisis, which upended the economy in 2007 and 2008. Parsons was named to the board of CBS in September 2018 but resigned a month later because of illness. 'Dick's storied career embodied the finest traditions of American business leadership,' Lazard said in a statement. The company, where Parsons was a board member from 2012 until this month, praised his 'unmistakable intelligence and his irresistible warmth.' 'Dick was more than an iconic leader in Lazard's history — he was a testament to how wisdom, warmth, and unwavering judgment could shape not just companies, but people's lives,' the company said. 'His legacy lives on in the countless leaders he counseled, the institutions he renewed, and the doors he opened for others.' Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager. Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division. He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL. Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions. In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. Parsons became CEO in 2002 and was named chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination. The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies. Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company. A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market. Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team. Parsons, whose love of jazz led to co-owning a Harlem jazz club, served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. He held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Parsons played basketball at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their family.	https://www.voanews.com/a/richard-parsons-prominent-black-executive-at-time-warner-citigroup-dies-at-76-/7915559.html	2024-12-26T18:54:46-08:00	
Bird flu virus shows mutations in first severe human case in US, agency says	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday its analysis of samples from the first severe case of bird flu in the country last week showed mutations not seen in samples from an infected backyard flock on the patient's property. The CDC said the patient's sample showed mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, the part of the virus that plays a key role in it attaching to host cells. The health body said the risk to the public from the outbreak has not changed and remains low. Last week, the United States reported its first severe case of the virus, in a Louisiana resident above the age of 65, who was suffering from severe respiratory illness. The patient was infected with the D1.1 genotype of the virus that was recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States, and not the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, human cases and some poultry in multiple states. The mutations seen in the patient are rare but have been reported in some cases in other countries and most often during severe infections. One of the mutations was also seen in another severe case from British Columbia, Canada.

New Syrian authorities arrest official from notorious prison, war monitor says	Syria's new authorities on Thursday arrested a military justice official from the government of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. The arrest of Mohammed Kanjo Hassan was confirmed by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights one day after deadly clashes erupted in the coastal province of Tartus, an Assad stronghold, where gunmen sought to protect him. Twenty members of Kanjo Hassan's associates were also arrested. Kanjo Hassan, who issued sentences, including death sentences, for detainees at the Saydnaya prison, is the highest-ranking official whose arrest has been announced since Assad was ousted on Dec. 8. Kanjo Hassan ran Syria's military field court from 2011-14, the first three years of the war that began with Assad's crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired democracy protests, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Diab Serriya, co-founder of the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Saydnaya Prison. Serriya said Kanjo Hassan had sentenced thousands of people to death in 'trials that lasted minutes.' His group estimates 30,000 people had been detained at the prison since 2011, and 6,000 were released. The rest are missing, AFP reported. The arrest was part of an operation launched Thursday against militias aligned with Assad, according to state news agency SANA. The reports said that the operation was focused on the western province of Tartus, and that some militia members had been killed. The development came a day after pro-Assad fighters killed 14 members of the rebel group that led the offensive that pushed Assad from power. Syria's new interior minister said on Telegram that 10 other people were wounded in what he called an 'ambush,' and he vowed to crack down on anyone who undermined Syria's security. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebel fighters were attacked while trying to arrest Kanjo Hassan. Syrian refugees U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Thursday that more than 50,000 refugees have returned to Syria during the past three weeks, with the rate of return slowly increasing. 'Material conditions inside Syria remain dire — more humanitarian and recovery assistance must be delivered to returnees and all those in need,' Grandi said. By comparison, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said earlier this month that it verified the return of 34,000 Syrian refugees during the first eight months of this year. More than 13 years of civil war prompted about 5 million people to flee the country, while 7 million others were displaced within Syria. More than half of the refugees went to Turkey, while most of the others fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. A UNHCR report earlier this month said that while many of the refugees are interested in returning to Syria, many are choosing to wait for now and evaluate the security situation and political stabilization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-syrian-authorities-arrest-official-from-notorious-prison-war-monitor-says/7915525.html	2024-12-26T17:17:34-08:00	
Moldova backs defense strategy calling for increased spending	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The parliament in ex-Soviet Moldova, controlled by pro-Western lawmakers, approved a 10-year defense strategy on Thursday calling for increased military spending as part of a plan to join the European Union. The chamber's pro-Russian opposition ridiculed the document as pointlessly directed against Moscow in view of Moldova's small land mass and armed forces. The document, presented by Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatii, aims to boost military spending by 2030 to 1% of gross domestic product, with figures showing increases already being put into place. 'The first step to implementing this was taken after the war in Ukraine started, by increasing budget resources for defense to 0.39% in 2022 and 0.55% in 2023,' the document said. One of Europe's poorest countries, lying between Ukraine and EU member Romania, Moldova is a candidate to join the EU, with a membership date set for 2030. It is not considering joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the country's neutral status is set down in its constitution. The document says Moldova's neutral status requires it to boost partnerships with different countries and international organizations to strengthen its national defense. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has jolted Moldova as drone fragments land on its territory and missiles aimed at Ukrainian targets pass through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, reelected to a second term last month, though by a smaller margin than anticipated, has accused Russia of trying to unseat her government. Members of the pro-Moscow Socialist Party dismissed the document as meaningless. 'If, God forbid, we are subject to an attack from the direction of the Russian Federation, how long do you think Moldova will resist such aggression?' Socialist member Adrian Albu asked the minister. The document cites risks of the Ukraine conflict spreading, particularly around the Black Sea port of Odesa close to Moldova's border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-backs-defense-strategy-calling-for-increased-spending/7915507.html	2024-12-26T16:56:04-08:00	
US Congress fails to extend North Korean Human Rights Act	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Congress once again failed to pass a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights Act, or NKHRA, painting a bleak picture for the future of the measure originally adopted by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2004 to ensure the U.S. continues to promote basic freedoms of speech, press and religion in North Korea. Last Friday, the Congress ended its 118th session at midnight without the Senate approving the extension of the NKHRA, which expired at the end of September 2022. The bill to extend the NKHRA was not even brought to the floor at the Senate this year, as the lawmakers were more focused on other issues, including averting a government shutdown. The bill called for measures such as reuniting Korean Americans with their families in North Korea, appointing a special envoy for North Korean human rights issues and supporting U.S. broadcasting efforts in North Korea. The 119th U.S. Congress starts next year, and the NKHRA reauthorization bill will have to be reintroduced at the new session and again go through a process of discussion, deliberation, changes and eventually voting. Lawmakers vow to try again It marks the first time since the NKHRA, became law that the reenactment bill has been dead for more than two years. Congress reapproved the measure three times, in 2008, 2012 and 2018. Lawmakers vowed to work toward the reenactment of the NKHRA during the next congressional session. Representative Young Kim, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said she was 'extremely disappointed that the Senate failed to take up the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act.' The House passed the bill last month. 'Kim Jong Un subjects his own people to gross human rights abuses as he grows his nuclear arsenal, and the Senate is turning a blind eye to North Korean aggression by failing to pass this bill,' Kim said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on Monday. 'This remains a top priority of mine,' she stressed. 'I will keep fighting to get this across the finish line to counter North Korea and promote U.S. leadership and values around the world.' The office of Representative Ami Bera, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean that Bera 'looks forward to working with his Senate colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation in the 119th Congress.' Kim and Bera led the bill in the House, while senators Marco Rubio and Tim Kaine introduced the Senate version of the bill. VOA Korean reached out to Rubio's and Kaine's offices for comments but did not receive a reply. VOA Korean also sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations, but did not receive a response. Competing priorities Human rights experts in Washington said getting the NKHRA passed in Congress is challenging because North Korean human rights must compete with other seemingly more urgent issues. 'It's very hard to — when you're competing with Gaza and Ukraine — to get people to focus on what's going on,' said Robert King, who served as special envoy for North Korea human rights issues at the U.S. State Department from November 2009 to January 2017. 'The effort continues, and people are still concerned, and people still reflect the views that North Korea needs to make progress on human rights, but there's a lot of competition. There are a lot of other issues and concerns that are also important,' King told VOA Korean on Tuesday by phone, adding that he doesn't see any skepticism among U.S. lawmakers about the effectiveness of the NKHRA. Greg Scarlatoiu, president of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told VOA Korean in a Zoom interview Tuesday that the two-year absence of the NKHRA is 'a matter of prioritizing other crises.' Scarlatoiu emphasized that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's monolithic power and pursuit of nuclear weapons have come at the cost of North Korean people's human rights. 'By means of oppressing and exploiting its own people at home and abroad, there is a clear nexus between human rights violations and the security challenges that North Korea poses to the world,' he said. Scarlatoiu also pointed out that the recent deployment of North Korean soldiers in Russia is clear evidence of the Kim regime's violation of human rights. 'Now, as unbelievable as that might have sounded two years ago, it poses a security threat to Europe, so this is a very, very urgent issue for the Congress,' he said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday there are indications that North Korea is preparing to send more troops and weapons to support Russia's war effort in Ukraine. North Korea so far has sent about 12,000 troops to Russia, according to South Korea, the United States and Ukraine. North Korean defectors say Pyongyang has likely kept the deployment of that nation's soldiers secret from its own people, including the soldiers' families. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment in response to VOA Korean's inquiry about Congress' failure to pass the bill. 'As a general matter, we do not comment on pending legislation,' the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The State Department maintains, however, that North Korea is one of the most repressive regimes in the world. 'The DPRK [North Korea] is among the most repressive authoritarian states in the world. Its human rights situation is deplorable,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on October 15, after North Korea criticized the U.S. in its annual Universal Periodic Review, a process through which each United Nations member state undergoes a peer review of its human rights records.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-fails-to-extend-north-korean-human-rights-act/7915242.html	2024-12-26T16:39:03-08:00

US says it pushed retraction of famine warning for north Gaza	WASHINGTON — A lead organization monitoring for food crises around the world withdrew a new report this week warning of imminent famine in north Gaza under what it called Israel's 'near-total blockade,' after the U.S. asked for its retraction, U.S. officials told The Associated Press. The move follows public criticism of the report from the U.S. ambassador to Israel. The rare public dispute drew accusations from prominent aid and human-rights figures that the work of the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System Network, meant to reflect the data-driven analysis of unbiased international experts, has been tainted by politics. A declaration of famine would be a great embarrassment for Israel, which has insisted that its 15-month war in Gaza is aimed against the Hamas militant group and not against its civilian population. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew earlier this week called the warning by the internationally recognized group inaccurate and irresponsible. Lew and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds the monitoring group, both said the findings failed to properly account for rapidly changing circumstances in north Gaza. Humanitarian and human rights officials expressed fear of U.S. political interference in the world's monitoring system for famines. The U.S. Embassy in Israel and the State Department declined comment. FEWS officials did not respond to questions. 'We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' Lew said Tuesday. USAID confirmed to the AP that it had asked the famine-monitoring organization to withdraw its stepped-up warning issued in a report dated Monday. The report did not appear among the top updates on the group's website Thursday, but the link to it remained active. The dispute points in part to the difficulty of assessing the extent of starvation in largely isolated northern Gaza. Thousands in recent weeks have fled an intensified Israeli military crackdown that aid groups say has allowed delivery of only a dozen trucks of food and water since roughly October. FEWS Net said in its withdrawn report that unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in north Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between January and March. The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. FEWS was created by the U.S. development agency in the 1980s and is still funded by it. FEWS is intended to provide independent, neutral and data-driven assessments of hunger crises, including in war zones. Its findings help guide decisions on aid by the U.S. and other governments and agencies around the world. A spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry, Oren Marmorstein, welcomed the U.S. ambassador's public challenge of the famine warning. 'FEWS NET - Stop spreading these lies!' Marmorstein wrote on X. In challenging the findings publicly, the U.S. ambassador 'leveraged his political power to undermine the work of this expert agency,' said Scott Paul, a senior manager at the Oxfam America humanitarian nonprofit. Paul stressed that he was not weighing in on the accuracy of the data or methodology of the report. 'The whole point of creating FEWS is to have a group of experts make assessments about imminent famine that are untainted by political considerations,' said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch and now a visiting professor in international affairs at Princeton University. 'It sure looks like USAID is allowing political considerations — the Biden administration's worry about funding Israel's starvation strategy — to interfere.' Israel says the vast majority of the area's residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. Lew, the U.S. ambassador, said the famine warning was based on 'outdated and inaccurate' data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000-75,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings. FEWS said in its report that its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 people remain. Roth criticized the U.S. challenge of the report in light of the gravity of the crisis there. 'This quibbling over the number of people desperate for food seems a politicized diversion from the fact that the Israeli government is blocking virtually all food from getting in,' he said, adding that 'the Biden administration seems to be closing its eyes to that reality, but putting its head in the sand won't feed anyone.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-it-pushed-retraction-of-famine-warning-for-north-gaza-/7915491.html	2024-12-26T16:12:17-08:00

Eritrean, Somali leaders discuss stability amid regional tensions	WASHINGTON — President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia held extensive discussions at the State House in Asmara, Eritrea, on Wednesday, focusing on the consolidation of bilateral ties and addressing regional and international issues of mutual concern. A statement from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said the two leaders underlined the importance of Somalia's stability for the entire Horn of Africa region. 'Securing and [guaranteeing] Somalia's stability is pivotal for enduring regional peace and stability. In this respect, the two leaders discussed, in greater depth, salient agendas that promote achievement of the desired objective,' the statement said. Leaders meet for summit In October, the leaders of Egypt, Eritrea and Somalia met for a three-way summit in Asmara against a backdrop of heightened tensions in the Horn of Africa region between Somalia and Ethiopia. The October meeting, in which the leaders aligned to sign an agreement covering defense, security, and diplomatic and political cooperation, followed concerns about security and stability that resulted from a controversial deal Ethiopia signed in January with the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland. That deal, if enacted, would give Ethiopia long-sought access to the Red Sea. Somali diplomats, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told VOA that the two leaders also discussed on Dec. 11 an Ethiopia-Somalia agreement in Ankara that aimed at ending diplomatic tensions between the neighboring countries. They said they have an agreement in principle but are working on technicalities. According to the Eritrean Foreign Ministry, during their talks on Wednesday, Isaias said that it was necessary for the region to overcome external interventions that often exacerbate conflicts, stressing that local challenges must be addressed internally. 'President Isaias elaborated on the imperative for the region to extricate itself from external interventions that often advance agendas of incubating and fomenting conflict and chaos in the region. In the event, it is critical for the region to address and resolve its own challenges.' In a subsequent statement to the Eritrean Press, Somali's president expressed his appreciation for Eritrea's contributions in the ongoing efforts for training Somalia's National Army and security institutions. 'The support of Eritrea to Somalia is vital for the stability of Somalia as well as the Horn of Africa region. Somalia can learn from Eritrea's vast experiences in the efforts to foster viable and robust partnerships,' Mohamud said. Leaders reaffirm objectives The two leaders in a statement reaffirmed the objectives laid out in the October Tripartite Summit agreement between Eritrea, Somalia and Egypt, aimed at enhancing cooperation and promoting stability in the region. The discussions come against the backdrop of Egypt's commitment to contribute troops to the African Union Somalia peacekeeping mission, highlighting the growing collaboration between Somalia and Egypt amid regional tensions, particularly concerning Ethiopia's plans to get sea access in Somaliland. Eritrea has been training thousands of Somalia forces for at least four years. Most of the military has received regular and specialized training, including the naval force, as well as mechanized units. Mohamud's visit was the eighth since his reelection in May 2022 and the fourth this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eritrean-somali-leaders-discuss-stability-amid-regional-tensions/7915213.html	2024-12-26T15:50:17-08:00

Panama president rules out talks with Trump over canal threat	PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday ruled out negotiations with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump over control of the Panama Canal, denying that China was interfering in its operation. Mulino also rejected the possibility of reducing tolls for U.S. vessels in response to Trump's threat to demand control of the vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans be returned to Washington. 'There's nothing to talk about,' Mulino said at a press conference. 'The canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians. There's no possibility of opening any kind of conversation around this reality, which has cost the country blood, sweat and tears,' he added. The canal, inaugurated in 1914, was built by the United States but handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos. Trump on Saturday slammed what he called 'ridiculous' fees for U.S. ships passing through the canal and hinted at China's growing influence. 'It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,' Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!' If Panama could not ensure 'the secure, efficient and reliable operation' of the channel, 'then we will demand that the Panama Canal be No Chinese returned to us, in full, and without question,' he said. US accounts for 74% of canal cargo An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America. The United States is its main user, accounting for 74% of cargo, followed by China with 21%. Mulino said the canal's usage fees were 'not set at the whim of the president or the administrator' of the interoceanic waterway, but under a long-established 'public and open process.' 'There is absolutely no Chinese interference or participation in anything to do with the Panama Canal,' Mulino said. Trump claims Chinese operate canal On Wednesday, Trump alleged on Truth Social, without evidence, that Chinese soldiers were 'lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal.' Mulino denied that allegation. 'There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God,' he said. Panama established diplomatic relations with China in 2017, after breaking off ties with Taiwan — a decision criticized by Trump's first administration. On Tuesday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Panama City and chanted 'Trump, animal, leave the canal alone' and burned an image of the incoming U.S. president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-president-rules-out-talks-with-trump-over-canal-threat-/7915162.html	2024-12-26T15:03:10-08:00	
Organizers say 2 sailors died in Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race	sydney — Organizers said Friday that two Sydney-to-Hobart sailors died at sea amid wild weather that forced many retirements, including the favorite to finish first, Master Lock Comanche. The race will proceed as the fleet continues its passage to Constitution Dock in Hobart, with the first boats expected to arrive later on Friday or early Saturday morning. The race is 628 nautical miles (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) long. The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Sydney, which administers the yacht race, said that one sailor each on entrants Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline were killed after being struck by the boom, a large horizontal pole at the bottom of the sail. The incident aboard Flying Fish Arctos occurred around 30 nautical miles east-southeast of Ulladulla on the New South Wales south coast. Crew members attempted CPR but could not revive their teammate. The crew member aboard Bowline was struck approximately 30 nautical miles east-northeast of Batemans Bay and fell unconscious, with CPR also unsuccessful. A police vessel was escorting Bowline to Batemans Bay, where she was expected to arrive later Friday morning. 'As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage,' the CYCA said in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased.' Flying Fish Arctos, a New South Wales-based 50-footer, has contested 17 previous Hobarts since being built in 2001. The boat was designed for around-the-world sailing and is currently used by Flying Fish, a sailing school that operates in Mosman, a suburb on Sydney's north shore. The deaths came 26 years after six sailors were killed in storms during the 1998 running of the race, which triggered a state coronial inquest and mass reforms to the safety protocols that govern the race. The first all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors was entered in the 2024 race, but was among about 15 retirements because of weather. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 was one of six international entrants and included sailors from the Philippine national team and the Philippine navy. Last year, LawConnect was first to cross the finish line after holding off defending champion Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. LawConnect, which was runner-up in the previous three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche's time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds — a margin of just 51 seconds. It was the second-closest finish in Sydney-to-Hobart history after Condor of Bermuda beat Apollo by seven seconds in 1982. Comanche holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won in 2017. LawConnect, which led out of Sydney Harbor, was leading the 2024 race but still had 400 nautical miles before reaching Hobart, indicating an overnight finish. Celestial V70 was in second place, about 10 nautical miles behind LawConnect.	https://www.voanews.com/a/organizers-say-two-sailors-have-died-in-sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race/7915177.html	2024-12-26T14:26:57-08:00	
Russian defense fire likely caused Azerbaijan plane crash, experts say	Aviation experts said Thursday that Russian air defense fire was likely responsible for the Azerbaijani plane crash the day before that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons still unclear and crashed while trying to land in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground and exploding in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass. Azerbaijan mourned the crash victims with national flags at half-staff across the country on Thursday. Traffic stopped at noon, and signals sounded from ships and trains as it observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but he said that the weather forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. As the official crash investigation started, some experts alleged that holes seen in the plane's tail section could indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. An official in Chechnya said another drone attack on the region was fended off Wednesday, although federal authorities didn't report it. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world's airspace and airports for risks, said that analysis of the images of fragments of the crashed plane indicate that it was almost certainly hit by a surface-to-air missile, or SAM. 'Much more to investigate, but at high level we'd put the probability of it being a SAM attack on the aircraft at being well into the 90 to 99% bracket,' he said. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal damage compatible with shrapnel from small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system. 'It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,' he said. Matveyev added that it remains unclear why the pilots decided to fly hundreds of miles east across the Caspian Sea instead of trying to land at a closer airport in Russia after the plane was hit. 'Perhaps some of the plane's systems kept working for some time and the crew believed that they could make it and land normally,' Matveyev said, adding that the crew could also have faced restrictions on landing at another venue in Russia. Caliber, an Azerbaijani news website with good government connections, also claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the apparent drone raid in the area. Khamzat Kadyrov, head of Chechnya's Security Council, said that air defenses downed drones attacking the region on Wednesday. Caliber also wondered why Russian authorities didn't allow the plane to make an emergency landing in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan's parliamentary speaker, Maulen Ashimbayev, also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane's fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and unethical. Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-defense-fire-likely-caused-azerbaijan-plane-crash-experts-say/7915149.html	2024-12-26T14:12:34-08:00	
Japan seeks better ties with China ahead of second Trump term	Japan and China are seeking to improve relations ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, but analysts say Beijing’s aggressive military activities across the Indo-Pacific region will make it hard for the sides to reduce longstanding tensions. 'Tokyo does want to have smoother ties with Beijing, given the likely tumultuousness of the U.S.-China relationship and also the global situation more broadly once Trump comes into office,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. 'However, the basic positions of both countries are too far apart, and as long as Beijing continues to make claims on the East China Sea and is demonstrating its ability to use military force to pursue those ends, it’s difficult for China and Japan to pursue a fundamental reset in bilateral relations,' he told VOA by phone. Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing on Wednesday. Both sides agreed to facilitate a visit by Wang to Japan in 2025 and improve relations on a basic societal level. 'China and Japan should also strengthen people-to-people exchanges, consolidate public support for China-Japan friendship, and properly handle disputes and differences,' Wang said on Wednesday, adding that Tokyo should 'calibrate its strategic perception' and 'pursue a positive policy toward China.' While Beijing focused largely on the positive aspect of the meeting, Iwaya reiterated Tokyo’s concerns about the increased Chinese military activities in areas near Japan and Japanese citizens’ safety in China during his meeting with Wang. Iwaya 'expressed Japan's serious concerns about the situation in the East China Sea, including the situation surrounding the Senkaku Islands, and the intensification of Chinese military activities,' the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. Despite these concerns, Iwaya and Wang agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue and organize the Japan-China Security Dialogue to improve communication over security issues. Experts say Japan believes it can extract 'some positive goods' from China because of Beijing’s increasing concern about the incoming Trump administration. 'Tokyo sees the Trump administration as likely being very difficult on China in terms of tariffs and security issues, and they understand they may have a little bit more leverage now,' Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University, told VOA by phone. He said because China remains committed to reshaping the security environment in its surrounding region, Japan is focusing on securing short-term gains in improving ties rather than resetting the relationship. 'They believe there might be an opportunity to extract some positive goods from the Chinese, whether it’s business or increasing the flows of people between the two,' Nagy added. Countries dispute Fukushima discharge One of the main disputes between China and Japan is Tokyo’s discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. Beijing has repeatedly opposed Tokyo’s move and imposed bans on the import of Japanese seafood. While both governments agreed on steps that would allow stakeholders like China to independently sample the treated waters in September, Wang and Iwaya’s discussion on the topic didn’t show signs of Beijing’s import ban being eased. 'Wang reiterated China's opposition to Japan's ocean discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water, stressing that Japan should fulfill its international obligations and commitments to China, establish a long-term international monitoring mechanism, and allow China to sample and test independently,' Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday. Despite China's continuation of the ban on Japanese seafood, Nagy said China will still try to seize this chance to strengthen relations with Japan and possibly weaken Washington-Tokyo ties. 'The Chinese government has a long track record of using economic incentives to drive a wedge between Washington and Tokyo, but since Japan has seen these strategies for decades and the Chinese economy is in decline, whether Beijing’s efforts can translate into sustainable changes is a different story,' he told VOA. Japan will prioritize US ties, says political scientist While Japan seeks to smooth ties with China, Chong in Singapore said the relationship with the U.S. will still be Tokyo’s priority once Trump returns to the White House in January. 'Tokyo will align [with the U.S.] as much as it can because the Japanese economy is very much tied with the U.S. economy,' he told VOA. During a press conference on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he wanted Japan to bolster its alliance with the U.S. 'I think it's important to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance even further ... and share a common understanding of the situation in northeast Asia,' he said. Although the relationship with the U.S. remains a priority for Japan, Nagy said Tokyo will still try to influence how U.S.-China competition develops under the second Trump administration. 'Japan will try to convey to Washington that their relationship with China isn’t simple because they can’t simply cut off the relations and over-securitize the relationship since Beijing remains a neighbor that is not going away,' he told VOA. 'When Tokyo engages with the U.S., it’s a relationship of cooperation, coordination, and an attempt to influence the decision-making process in Washington so that they don’t take an over-securitized approach to the competition with China,' Nagy added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-seeks-better-ties-with-china-ahead-of-second-trump-term/7915120.html	2024-12-26T13:54:34-08:00	
Amid divisions, Kurds pursue unified representation in post-Assad Syria	WASHINGTON — Despite longstanding divisions, Kurdish political leaders and analysts say Syrian Kurdish groups are seeking a unified delegation to represent their interests in Damascus in negotiations with Syria’s new authorities. Since 2012, northeast Syria’s Kurdish region has been under the control of forces affiliated with the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. The region is predominantly governed by the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, whose military arm forms the backbone of the SDF. For its part, Turkey views all these groups as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey, a major actor in post-Assad Syria, has pledged to eliminate these Kurdish groups if they refuse to disarm. The Kurdish National Council, or ENKS, is another coalition of Kurdish parties in Syria that have opposed the PYD’s de facto rule in the northeast. The ENKS has ties with Turkey and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the ruling party in Iraqi Kurdistan. This week, ENKS and SDF held a meeting attended by officials from the U.S.-led coalition against IS. The meeting was 'to discuss the formation of a unified Kurdish position within the framework of the new Syria,' according to a joint statement. 'The sides agreed on the importance of urgently continuing meetings to resolve contentious issues.' Sulaiman Oso, the ENKS president who attended the meeting on Monday, said the discussion between the two sides was transparent. 'This was our first meeting with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi in four years,' he told VOA. 'We were clear and transparent about our demands, including an end to arrests of our members and the burning of our offices,' he added, referring to recent incidents in which ENKS members have been targeted by local security forces. Oso said that trust between the two sides has significantly eroded in recent years. 'We cannot go to Damascus with a unified delegation if these internal matters aren’t resolved first,' he said, adding that the U.S., U.K. and France are pushing both Kurdish sides to reach an agreement soon. None of these countries has publicly commented on their involvement in supporting intra-Kurdish dialogue in Syria. However, since Bashar al-Assad’s fall on Dec. 8, U.S., French and British officials have highlighted the need to safeguard the rights of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, including the Kurds. Saleh Muslim, a senior PYD official, emphasized the importance of forming a unified Kurdish delegation that includes Arabs and Christians from northeast Syria to effectively represent the region’s diverse population and their demands. 'The current meetings are still in the consultation stage,' he told VOA. 'Nothing concrete has emerged yet, but the ENKS has already sent representatives to Damascus for discussions.' The ENKS says its representatives are in the capital to hold meetings with community leaders, not with the new authorities, which are dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the rebel group that led the 11-day offensive resulting in Assad’s downfall. The HTS is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., although initial meetings have taken place between U.S. diplomats and HTS leaders in Damascus. Oso of ENKS said no current presence should replace a unified Kurdish representation in Damascus. Observers warn that the slow progress between the two Kurdish sides could undermine efforts to establish a Kurdish foothold in Damascus. 'This is a historic moment for Syria,' said Zara Saleh, a Kurdish political analyst in London. 'If the Kurds don’t have a unified and strong representation in Damascus, Kurdish demands could be ignored by the new Islamist authorities, who already view them with suspicion.' HTS officials, including leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, have said that Kurdish rights will be protected in Syria. But in a recent interview with the Saudi news channel al-Hadath, Murhaf Abu Qasra, who was appointed by the HTS as defense minister in Syria’s caretaker government, rejected the concept of federalism, describing it as a means to divide Syria. Syrian Kurdish groups are advocating for federalism as a solution to both their political demands and the broader issues facing the country. But that is something that the SDF, PYD and ENKS have failed to clearly articulate, says analyst Zara Saleh. 'Their political rhetoric expired the moment the Syrian regime fell,' Saleh said. 'Therefore, there is an urgent need to include Kurdish experts, civil society leaders and influential social figures in any delegation heading to Damascus, and the United States, along with other stakeholders, should advocate for this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-divisions-kurds-pursue-unified-representation-in-post-assad-syria-/7915063.html	2024-12-26T12:41:15-08:00	
Taiwan seeks clarity on Trump team policy amid Chinese pressure	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the world prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taiwan finds itself sandwiched between Washington and Beijing as it grapples with uncertainties about the outlook of U.S.-Taiwan relations and growing military pressure from China. Trump has already picked several politicians known for their hawkish stances on China as potential nominees for his Cabinet, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but analysts say the president-elect's comments about Taiwan on the campaign trail and in recent interviews have not offered much clarity about how he might handle one of Washington’s most delicate relationships. 'We don't know if [Trump] means it when he wants to return the United States to a more isolationist position,' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute. During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy. 'I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,' he said. In October, Trump pledged to impose additional tariffs on China if Beijing were to 'go into Taiwan.' 'I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,' the President-elect said during an interview with The Wall Street Journal. In his first post-election interview with NBC News on Dec. 8, Trump didn’t publicly say whether the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. 'I’d prefer that they don’t do it,' Trump said, adding that he has a 'very good relationship' with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two have been communicating since last month’s election. During his time in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has on multiple occasions said his administration would defend Taiwan if it was attacked. Not panicking, but concerned Some Taiwanese residents worry about what they describe as a lack of clarity from the Trump administration. 'I’m slightly concerned about how Trump’s return to the White House might affect relations between the U.S. and Taiwan because he always prioritizes U.S. interests, which makes it hard to predict how his administration might form their Taiwan policies,' Angel Chi, a 28-year-old medical worker, told VOA in a recent interview on the streets of Taipei. Others say while Trump’s position on Taiwan seems uncertain, they do not think his administration will reduce support for Taipei. 'I still have faith in the U.S. democratic system because he can’t decide everything by himself,' Christine Chiu, a 42-year-old accountant, told VOA. The strong bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress and some potential Trump Cabinet members’ track records on foreign policy could prevent U.S.-Taiwan relations from undergoing major changes during Trump’s second term, experts said. 'I don’t think there is panic in Taipei because we dealt with this situation before and we have confidence in our congressional support in the U.S.,' said Lai I-Chung, president of The Prospect Foundation, a Taiwan-based think tank made up of academics and government officials. 'The mood [in Taiwan] is we will be careful and watchful about the development, but we are not panicking,' he told VOA in an interview in Taipei. Taiwan-US relations In recent weeks, Taiwan’s government has been reaching out to Republican congressional leaders and Trump’s transition team. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te spoke with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on the phone during his first overseas trip to the Pacific region in early December. On that trip, Lai had stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Additionally, two senior national security officials from Taiwan traveled to the U.S. last week to meet members of Trump’s transition team, hoping to establish ties before next month’s inauguration, Reuters news agency reported last on Dec. 19. Cole said there should be enough 'institutional resistance' in the U.S. government to prevent longstanding policies toward Taiwan from being abruptly altered. During a regular press conference on Dec. 6, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question on Lai’s stopover in Guam and Hawaii and said, 'No one should underestimate the firm resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China’s military pressure campaign As Taiwan tries to deepen its engagement with U.S. officials and the incoming Trump administration, China has been increasing military pressure on the island throughout 2024. Beijing has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan since Lai took office in May. Last week, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Beijing deployed the largest number of naval and coast guard vessels to regional waters in almost three decades. Apart from military exercises, China has increased pressure on Taiwan through a range of what are called gray zone operations, measures that involve irregular tactics but stop short of combat. China’s use of its coast guard to intimidate and test Taiwan is one example of those gray zone tactics. Beijing has repeatedly sent coast guard vessels to patrol waters near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands since February. Kinmen and Matsu are closer to China than they are to the main island of Taiwan. The Prospect Foundation’s Lai said China has some coast guard vessels that are similar in size to naval destroyers, making it harder for Taiwan’s coast guard to respond proportionately. 'It would be difficult for Taiwan to [deploy] naval vessels against the Chinese coast guard, and when Taiwan responds by deploying its coast guard forces, the vessels are smaller ships [while] the Chinese coast guard vessels are as big as navy ships,' he told VOA. Countering China To counter the growing military pressure and gray zone operations from Beijing, Taiwan has incorporated more unscripted, real-combat drills into its annual military exercises. The island has also increased its defense budget in recent years, which is set to reach a new high of $19.74 billion dollars in 2025. This year, Taiwan’s government also established a committee to help strengthen the island’s civil defense capabilities. Cole said Taiwan still faces challenges in that regard. 'There is still quite a bit of resistance not only within the security apparatus and armed forces, which don’t like the idea of involving citizens in defense, the opposition parties have also sought to derail [relevant] plans and fundings,' he told VOA. What may come next depends on Taiwan’s actions and Beijing’s assessment of Trump’s policies toward the island after he takes office in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-seeks-clarity-on-trump-administration-policy-amid-chinese-pressure/7915065.html	2024-12-26T12:14:16-08:00	
Nigeria probes Christmas Day airstrike that killed 10	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities in northwest Sokoto state launched a probe Thursday into a Christmas Day airstrike by the military that killed at least 10 people. Sokoto Governor Ahmed Aliyu said in a statement he's in talks with the Nigerian Army to ensure a thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to the airstrike on early Wednesday. The military said in a statement Wednesday it was targeting the terror group Lakurawa in the villages of Gidan Sama and Rumtuwa, but Aliyu said the attack 'claimed the lives of innocent citizens.' State authorities said 10 people were killed and many others injured. Aliyu extended his condolences to the victims' families and pledged to support them with cash and food. The incident is the latest in a series of accidental strikes in recent years, raising concerns among human rights groups, including Amnesty International. 'This is yet another sign that the Nigerian military has not changed, and they have not learned a lesson from previous airstrikes that killed civilians,' said Isa Sanusi, Amnesty’s country director in Nigeria. 'I believe that they have to review their procedures, they have to investigate these incidents thoroughly, and they have to find a way to end this reckless deadly use of force. The military said that it did not target civilians and that it took necessary measures to avoid such accidents. The Nigerian Air Force said it will investigate. Nigeria has been waging deadly wars against terrorists, armed gangs and separatists for years, but accidents have been recurring. Last December, a military airstrike that hit Tudun Biri village in northern Kaduna state killed more than 120 people. In September, another airstrike in Kaduna killed 24 people. Nigerian authorities have promised to be more cautious, but in a Christmas broadcast, Nigerian Air Staff Chief Hassan Abubakar said, 'To every member of the Nigerian Air Force family, I want to especially thank you for your unwavering dedication, resilience and sacrifice in service of our great nation. Your commitment and professionalism have been instrumental in ensuring the security and stability of our beloved country.' In November, Nigerian authorities announced the emergence of the Lakurawa sect in the northwest and said security forces were tracking the group's activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-probes-christmas-airstrike-that-killed-10/7915030.html	2024-12-26T11:48:53-08:00	
Deadly attack on journalists underscores danger for media in Haiti	A deadly gang attack in Haiti earlier this week that killed two journalists and wounded seven more underscores the dangers facing journalists in a nation that has been plagued by gang violence for years. At least two journalists — including one who worked with Voice of America — were killed and at least seven other journalists wounded when armed men fired on reporters gathered for the reopening of Haiti’s largest public hospital in the capital, Port-au-Prince, earlier this week, according to media reports and the Haitian government. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said it was 'appalled' by the attack. 'We send deepest condolences to the families of those killed and call on Haitian authorities to swiftly bring these killers to justice,' a CPJ spokesperson said in a statement this week. Among those killed in the Christmas Eve attack was Marckendy Natoux, who did marketing for VOA’s Creole Service. Natoux worked for VOA’s umbrella organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, but also reported for various local outlets, including Heritage Express News and Boston Caribbean Network. Natoux began working for USAGM in 2022 and was dedicated to publicizing VOA Creole’s work, according to the journalist’s USAGM colleague, Iscar Blanco. 'He always offered a smile to everyone and a helping hand to anyone who needed it,' Blanco told VOA. Natoux is remembered as someone who was always eager to help his colleagues and community members. Blanco recalled how Natoux was always quick to help whenever journalists needed a microphone, a cable or anything else. And on the weekend, Natoux often volunteered to help the local community, according to Blanco. 'I am sure that he will always be remembered for his dedication to his work, but beyond work, for his love as a father, husband and friend,' Blanco added. Natoux is survived by his wife and two children. Jimmy Jean, a reporter with the online TV outlet Moun Afe Bon, was also killed in the Tuesday morning attack, which underscores the severe threats facing journalists working in the Caribbean nation. Seven other journalists covering the event were wounded. One police officer was killed, and another police officer was wounded in the shooting at State University of Haiti Hospital, which is known locally as the General Hospital. A local gang leader named Johnson 'Izo' Andre of the Viv Ansanm, or Living Together, gang coalition posted a video on social media claiming responsibility for the attack. Members of the Viv Ansanm coalition of street gangs, which have taken control of much of the Haitian capital, surrounded the hospital and opened fire through a metal gate. The gangs later said they were angry that the government had announced the hospital’s reopening without their permission. The Haitian Association of Journalists said the attack was 'a macabre scene comparable to terrorism, pure and simple.' The association also called for 'authorities to act prudently in their rush to make decisions, to avoid exposing to danger the journalists and others who accompany them at their events.' In a statement posted on social media, the prime minister’s office said, 'This heinous act, which targets an institution dedicated to health and life, constitutes an unacceptable assault on the very foundations of our society.' In a video statement, Leslie Voltaire, president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council, said that the shooting was 'unacceptable,' adding, 'This act will not remain without consequences.' 'I send my sympathies to the people who were victims, the national police and the journalists,' Voltaire also said. Haiti has been rocked by severe gang violence and political instability since President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in 2021 by a group of foreign mercenaries in a plot that authorities say involved elite Haitian police officers. More than 5,300 people have been killed in gang-related violence in Haiti in 2024, according to the United Nations. And more than 2,100 people have been injured in gang-related violence. Also in 2024, CPJ ranked Haiti worst in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings. The press freedom group has documented seven targeted journalist killings in the Caribbean nation over the past decade. To date, none of those killings have been solved. 'With increased violence, the dangers to journalists rise,' CPJ’s CEO, Jodie Ginsberg, told VOA in October. 'Haiti being at the top of this year’s impunity index is really a reflection of that increased violence.' Haiti ranks 93 out of 180 countries on the Global Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media freedom environment. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-attack-on-journalists-underscores-danger-for-media-in-haiti/7914953.html	2024-12-26T10:46:20-08:00	
Al-Shabab says one of its commanders killed in drone strike	Militant group al-Shabab said one of its top commanders, Mohamed Mire, was killed in a drone strike near Kunyo Barrow in Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region. Al-Shabab did not say when the strike took place but blamed the United States for the killing. The U.S. Africa Command did not immediately respond to VOA requests for comment on the reported strike. In a statement, Somalia’s Ministry of Information said the operation was 'well-planned' and conducted in coordination with international partners — an acknowledgement that a second party was involved in the operation. It said the Somali government and partners have been hunting Mire for a long time. Lower Shabelle Region Governor Mohamed Ibrahim Barre told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that the operation occurred two days ago. Barre said Mire was traveling from the town of Jilib to Kunyo Barrow when he was targeted about 8 kilometers outside the town. Mire was head of al-Shabab’s regions department (Wilayaat), the militant group’s equivalent of an interior ministry. He also held multiple other positions within the group. In July, Somalia’s anti-money laundering committee issued a sanctions list targeting Mire and seven other al-Shabab commanders. U.S. officials designated Mire a global terrorist in October 2022, describing him as a senior al-Shabab leader responsible for the group’s strategic decision-making and head of the group’s interior wing, overseeing many of the group’s activities in Somalia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/al-shabab-says-one-of-its-commanders-killed-in-drone-strike/7914910.html	2024-12-26T10:05:08-08:00	
Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dies at 92	NEW DELHI — Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92. Singh was admitted to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to 'sudden loss of consciousness at home,' the hospital said in a statement. He was 'being treated for age-related medical conditions,' the statement said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India's longest-serving prime ministers at 10 years and earned a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers. Singh was elected to a second term as prime minister from 2009 to 2014, which was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party's crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-indian-prime-minister-manmohan-singh-dies-at-92/7914896.html	2024-12-26T10:03:49-08:00	
Pakistan military court sentences 60 supporters of jailed former PM Khan	Islamabad — A military court in Pakistan on Thursday sentenced 60 supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for allegedly attacking army facilities. A nephew of the 72-year-old imprisoned leader and two former army officers are among those convicted, as reported by the Pakistani army’s media wing. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces a range of charges, including corruption, sedition, and inciting violence against the military. 'The nation, government, and the armed forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained,' the military statement said. The convictions came less than a week after a military court handed down sentences to 25 members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party on the same charges. The allegations against Khan supporters stem from nationwide protests in May 2023, during which demonstrators stormed and ransacked several military installations in an unprecedented show of public outrage against the powerful Pakistani institution. The PTI has rejected the 'secretive' military trials. Khan and his aides deny any wrongdoing, saying intelligence agency operatives had infiltrated the ranks of 'peaceful' PTI protesters and carried out the vandalism to justify a subsequent state crackdown on the opposition party, charges government officials rejected. Last week’s sentencing of the initial group of 25 PTI members to 'vigorous imprisonment' of up to 10 years drew an international backlash. The United States urged Pakistani authorities to respect the right to a fair trial and due process in line with the country’s constitution. 'The United States is deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal. ... These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,' said a State Department statement on Monday. Britain also criticized Pakistan for putting civilians on trial in military courts, saying they lack 'transparency, independent scrutiny' and undermine 'the right to a fair trial.' The European Union condemned the sentencing of Pakistani civilians by military courts, calling the practice 'inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' The Pakistani government has defended the military trials and subsequent convictions, stating they uphold the right to a fair trial and allow appeals within military tribunals and civil courts. 'We also have underlined on multiple occasions that Pakistan's constitution and Pakistan's legal system have the capacity to resolve any issues that arise internally,' foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told her weekly news conference Thursday. '[The] Pakistani system has the remedy of judicial review by superior courts. … We will continue to uphold our Constitution and Pakistani law and our obligations under international law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-military-court-sentences-60-supporters-of-jailed-former-pm-khan/7914849.html	2024-12-26T08:57:08-08:00	
Israel strikes Yemen's Sanaa airport, power stations, ports	JERUSALEM — Israel's military said it struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including Sanaa International Airport and three ports along the western coast. Attacks hit Yemen's Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations as well as military infrastructure in the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib, Israel's military said. There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, who have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli attacks on the airport, Hodeidah and one power station were reported by Al Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by the Houthis. More than a year of Houthi attacks have disrupted international shipping routes through the Red Sea, forcing firms to reroute to longer and more-expensive journeys that have, in turn, stoked fears over global inflation. Israel has instructed its diplomatic missions in Europe to try to get the Houthis designated as a terrorist organization. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Monday over Houthi attacks against Israel, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel's military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-yemen-s-sanaa-airport-ports-power-stations/7914813.html	2024-12-26T08:41:07-08:00	
Zimbabwe says SADC regional bloc ready to assist troubled Mozambique	Mount Hampden, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa — who is chairing SADC — has said the regional bloc is ready to assist troubled Mozambique engulfed in post-election violence that has claimed more than 100 lives of protesters, according to human rights organizations. South Africa calls for dialogue in the former Portuguese colony, where the opposition is claiming its electoral victory was stolen in the Oct. 9 polls. In a statement, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, current chairman of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community, SADC, said the post-election violence in Mozambique must end after the country’s Constitutional Council this week gave 65% victory of the October to the ruling Frelimo party. Ronald Lomola, South Africa’s minister of international relations and cooperation, released an audio message on social media weighing in on post election violence in Mozambique. 'South Africa calls on all parties to commit to an urgent dialogue that will heal the country and set it on a new political and developmental trajectory. Furthermore, South Africa is ready to assist Mozambique in any manner to facilitate this dialogue,' he said. So did Venancio Mondlane, Mozambique’s runner-up to Frelimo’s Daniel Francisco Chapo in the disputed October presidential election. He said 'We not focused on our brother who is also suffering, who has been massacred by Frelimo. That’s not our focus. If you want change in the country, a revolution, my brothers, let’s defend the shops of our neighbors, the companies of our neighbors, let’s defend them.' Khanyo Farise, Amnesty International deputy regional director for east and southern Africa, urged Mocambique government to end what she called one of the worst crackdowns on protesters. 'Since the outcome of the elections on Oct. 9, police have responded with excessive use of force against those who decide to express themselves and to exercise their right to freedom of association and assembly. We've seen police using live ammunition, using rubber bullets and using various forms of excessive force against protesters. Many people have been seriously wounded, and over 110 people have been killed,' she said. Borges Nhamirre, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, said peace is important so the country’s closed ports can open to service countries like Zimbabwe, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi and South Africa. 'So, nothing is happening. Everything has been paralyzed in Mozambique. It means that people will face more hardship[s] even after this is over. So, the fastest way to solve this problem is dialogue. There is no alternative to dialogue,' said Nhamirre. With the opposition and regional organizations such as SADC and African Union now calling for peace in Mozambique, there is hope that the situation can change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-says-sadc-regional-bloc-ready-to-assist-troubled-mozambique/7914768.html	2024-12-26T08:19:09-08:00	
Finland detains Russia-linked vessel on suspicion it damaged undersea cable	FRANKFURT, GERMANY — Finnish authorities have detained a Russia-linked ship as they investigate whether it damaged a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables, according to police and news media reports, in the latest incident involving disruption of key infrastructure. Finnish police and border guards boarded the vessel, the Eagle S, just past midnight Thursday and took over the command bridge, Helsinki Police Chief Jari Liukku said at a news conference. The vessel was intercepted in Finland's exclusive economic zone and taken to Finnish territorial waters, police said. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials as a suspected part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers, Yle television reported. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions over the war against Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Eagle S's anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle reported, relying on police statements. The Estlink-2 power cable, which brings electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down just after noon on Wednesday. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. The Estonian government was holding a meeting on the issue Thursday, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on X. Two data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany's defense minister said officials had to assume the incident was 'sabotage,' but he did not provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The remark came during a speech in which he discussed hybrid warfare threats from Russia. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have said the cause was sabotage and launched criminal probes. Estonian network operator Elering says there was enough spare capacity to meet power needs on the Estonian side, public broadcaster ERR said on its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-detains-russia-linked-vessel-on-suspicion-it-damaged-undersea-cable/7914658.html	2024-12-26T07:03:46-08:00	
Poll: Exhausted by political news, Americans are tuning out	New York — As a Democrat who immersed himself in political news during the presidential campaign, Ziad Aunallah has much in common with many Americans since the election. He's tuned out. 'People are mentally exhausted,' said Aunallah, 45, of San Diego. 'Everyone knows what is coming and we are just taking some time off.' Television ratings — and now a new poll — clearly illustrate the phenomenon. About two-thirds of American adults say they have recently felt the need to limit media consumption about politics and government because of overload, according to the survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Smaller percentages of Americans are limiting their intake of news about overseas conflicts, the economy or climate change, the poll says. Politics stand out. Election news on CNN and MSNBC was taking up too much of Sam Gude's time before the election, said the 47-year-old electrician from Lincoln, Nebraska. 'The last thing I want to watch right now is the interregnum,' said Gude, a Democrat and no fan of President-elect Donald Trump. Poll finds more Democrats than Republicans stepping away from news The poll, conducted in early December, found that about 7 in 10 Democrats say they are stepping back from political news. The percentage isn't as high for Republicans, who have reason to celebrate Trump's victory. Still, about 6 in 10 Republicans say they've felt the need to take some time off too, and the share for independents is similar. The differences are far starker for the TV networks that have been consumed by political news. After election night through Dec. 13, the prime-time viewership of MSNBC was an average of 620,000, down 54% from the pre-election audience this year, the Nielsen company said. For the same time comparison, CNN's average of 405,000 viewers was down 45%. At Fox News Channel, a favorite news network for Trump fans, the post-election average of 2.68 million viewers is up 13%, Nielsen said. Since the election, 72% of the people watching one of those three cable networks in the evening were watching Fox News, compared to 53% prior to election day. A post-election slump for fans of the losing candidate is not a new trend for networks that have become heavily identified for a partisan audience. MSNBC had similar issues after Trump was elected in 2016. Same for Fox in 2020, although that was complicated by anger: many of its viewers were outraged then by the network's crucial election night call of Arizona for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and sought alternatives. MSNBC had its own anger issues after several 'Morning Joe' viewers became upset that hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited Trump shortly after his victory last month. Yet while the show's ratings are down 35% since Election Day, that's a smaller drop than the network's prime-time ratings. CNN points out that while it has been suffering in the television ratings, its streaming and digital ratings have been consistent. Will political interest rebound when Trump takes office? MSNBC can take some solace in history. In previous years, network ratings bounce back when the depression after an election loss lifts. When a new administration takes office, people who oppose it are frequently looking for a gathering place. 'I'll be tuning back in once the clown show starts,' Aunallah said. 'You have no choice. Whether or not you want to hear it, it's happening. If you care about your country, you have no choice but to pay attention.' But the ride may not be smooth. MSNBC's slide is steeper than it was in 2016; and there's some question about whether Trump opponents will want to be as engaged as they were during his first term. People are also unplugging from cable television in rates that are only getting more rapid, although MSNBC believes it has bucked this trend eating away at audiences before. The poll indicates that Americans want less talk about politics from public figures in general. After an election season where endorsements from celebrities like Taylor Swift made headlines, the survey found that Americans are more likely to disapprove than approve of celebrities, large companies and professional athletes speaking out about politics. Still, Gude is among those discovering other ways to get news to which he does want to pay attention, including on YouTube. MSNBC is also in the middle of some corporate upheaval that raises questions about potential changes. Parent company Comcast announced last month that the cable network is among some properties that will spin off into a new company, which will give MSNBC new corporate leadership and cut its ties to NBC News. Advice for networks who want to see the viewers return Some of the Americans who have turned away from political news lately also had some advice for getting them engaged again. Gude said, for example, that MSNBC will always have a hard-core audience of Trump haters. But if the network wants to expand its audience, 'then you have to talk about issues, and you have to stop talking about Trump.' Kathleen Kendrick, a 36-year-old sales rep from Grand Junction, Colorado, who's a registered independent voter, said she hears plenty of people loudly spouting off about their political opinions on the job. She wants more depth when she watches the news. Much of what she sees is one-sided and shallow, she said. 'You get a story but only part of a story,' Kendrick said. 'It would be nice if you could get both sides, and more research.' Aunallah, similarly, is looking for more depth and variety. He's not interested 'in watching the angry man on the corner yelling at me anymore,' he said. 'It's kind of their own fault that I'm not watching,' he said. 'I felt they spent all this time talking about the election. They made it so much of their focus that when the main event ends, why would people want to keep watching?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/americans-are-exhausted-by-political-news-tv-ratings-and-new-ap-norc-poll-show-they-re-tuning-out/7914688.html	2024-12-26T07:02:19-08:00

Prayers and tears mark 20 years since Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia — People gathered in prayer and visited mass graves in Indonesia's Aceh province on Thursday to mark 20 years since the massive Indian Ocean tsunami hit the region in one of modern history's worst natural disasters. Many wept as they placed flowers at a mass grave in Ulee Lheue village, where more than 14,000 unidentified tsunami victims are buried. It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered. 'We miss them and we still don't know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,' said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies. 'This life is only temporary, so we do our best to be useful to others,' Amirudin, visiting the grave with his wife, said. The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone. Even though 20 years have passed, survivors in Indonesia are still grieving the loved ones they lost to the giant wave that flattened buildings all the way to the provincial capital of Banda Aceh. Hundreds of people gathered to pray at the Baiturrahman Mosque in downtown Banda Aceh. Sirens sounded across the city for three minutes to mark the time of the earthquake. Infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety. The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed. In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country. The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation's history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed. Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village's tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers. Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it. 'I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I'm very angry with it. I can't even put my foot in the water,' she said. But, she said, 'I still hear her voice in my ears, that she's calling for me. I can't abandon her. So I have to be here, for my child.' In India, hundreds gathered at Marina beach in the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. They poured milk into the sea to propitiate gods and offered flowers and prayers for the dead as drums beat in the background. According to official data, 10,749 people were killed in India, including nearly 7,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone. 'It has been 20 years since the tsunami,' said 69-year-old Sadayammal, who uses one name. 'We are here to pay respects to the people who lost their lives.' In Sri Lanka, survivors and relatives of tsunami victims gathered at the coastal village of Pereliya and laid flowers at a memorial that commemorates nearly 2,000 passengers who died when their train, the Queen of the Sea, was hit by the wave. Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived. Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day. 'I looked for them everywhere for years and still, no information about them. Their loss is a great sorrow and pain for me. I am still grieving,' he said. Overall, more than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka in the tsunami. People across the country observed two minutes of silence on Thursday in memory of those who lost their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prayers-and-tears-mark-20-years-since-indian-ocean-tsunami-that-killed-some-230-000-people-/7914550.html	2024-12-26T04:59:25-08:00	
Azerbaijan observes day of mourning for air crash victims as speculation mount about its cause	Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the disaster that remained unknown. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside in the grass. On Thursday, national flags were lowered across Azerbaijan, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains as the country observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment. As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some commentators alleging that holes seen in the plane's tail section possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. Some Russian media claimed that another drone attack on Chechnya happened on Wednesday, although it wasn't officially confirmed. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan's parliamentary Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane's fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and 'unethical.' Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-observes-day-of-mourning-for-air-crash-victims-as-speculation-mount-about-its-cause/7914523.html	2024-12-26T04:32:00-08:00	
New Syrian authorities launch operation against pro-Assad militias, state media reports	Syria’s new authorities launched an operation Thursday against militias aligned with ousted President Bashar al-Assad, according to state news agency SANA. The reports said the operation was focused in the western province of Tartous, and that some militia members had been killed. The development came a day after pro-Assad fighters killed 14 members of the rebel group that led the offensive that pushed Assad from power. Syria's new interior minister said on Telegram that 10 other people were wounded in what he called an 'ambush,' and he vowed to crack down on anyone who undermines Syria’s security. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebel fighters were attacked while trying to arrest a former official from Assad’s government who was accused of issuing execution orders at the notorious Saydnaya prison. Syrian refugees U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Thursday that more than 50,000 refugees have returned to Syria during the last three weeks, with the rate of return slowly increasing. 'Material conditions inside Syria remain dire - more humanitarian and recovery assistance must be delivered to returnees and all those in need,' Grandi said. By comparison, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said earlier this month that it verified the return of 34,000 Syrian refugees during the first eight months of this year. More than 13 years of civil war pushed about 5 million people to flee the country, while 7 million others were displaced within Syria. More than half of the refugees went to Turkey, while most of the others fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. A UNHCR report earlier this month said while many of the refugees are interested in returning to Syria, many are choosing to wait for now and evaluate the security situation and political stabilization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-syrian-authorities-launch-operation-against-pro-assad-militias-state-media-reports/7914502.html	2024-12-26T04:03:21-08:00	
Russia says cargo ship blast was 'terrorist attack'	Moscow — A 'terrorist act' sank the cargo ship that went down in international waters in the Mediterranean this week, the Russian state-owned company that owns the vessel said Wednesday. The Oboronlogistika company said it 'thinks a targeted terrorist attack was committed on December 23, 2024, against the Ursa Major,' it said in a statement cited by Russian news agencies, without indicating who may have been behind the act or why. The ship sank in international waters off Spain in the early hours of Tuesday after having sent a distress call for help on Monday. 'Three consecutive explosions' took place on the ship before it began taking on water, added the company, which belongs to the Russian defense ministry. Oboronlogistika did not say what evidence it had allowing it to conclude a terrorist attack sank the Ursa Major. Russian foreign ministry's crisis unit said on Telegram on Tuesday that the ship sank 'after an explosion in the engine room.' It added that out of the 16 Russian crew members on board, 14 had been rescued and taken to the Spanish port of Cartagena and two were missing. The ship sent a distress call Monday morning from off the coast of southeastern Spain in bad weather, reporting it was listing and sailors had launched a lifeboat, Spain's sea rescue service said in a statement. Spain sent out a helicopter and rescue boats and took the survivors to port, the service said. A Russian warship then arrived and took charge of the rescue operation since the ship was between Spanish and Algerian waters, after which the Ursa Major sank overnight. The Ursa Major is listed on MarineTraffic.com as a 124.7-meter long general cargo ship. It is owned by a subsidiary of Russia's Oboronlogistika, which belongs to the defense ministry and also provides civilian transport and logistics, the Russian foreign ministry said. The Ursa Major was sailing from the Russian city of Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East. Last week Oboronlogistika issued a press release with photos of the ship in port, saying it was to transport a particularly large and heavy load: cranes each weighing 380 tons and hatch covers for icebreakers each weighing 45 tons to Vladivostok. The United States in 2022 imposed sanctions on Oboronlogistika and ships including the Ursa Major for providing 'transportation services...for the delivery of cargo to Russian-occupied Crimea'. This means any U.S. organization dealing with the company or its ships would risk sanctions. Ukraine's GUR military intelligence said the Ursa Major was also used to supply Russian troops in Syria where Moscow has a naval base at Tartus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-cargo-ship-blast-was-terrorist-attack/7914477.html	2024-12-26T03:25:11-08:00	
Cambodia opposition politician jailed for 2 years for incitement	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — A Cambodian opposition politician was sentenced on Thursday to two years in jail and banned from elections for inciting social unrest, his lawyer said, the latest in a series of cases that activists say are attempts to silence government critics. Sun Chanthy, president of the Nation Power Party, was arrested and charged in May after meeting supporters in Japan. Police said he had spread false information on Facebook to mislead the public but his arrest was not politically motivated, local media reported at the time. His lawyer, Choung Chou Ngy, on Thursday told reporters Sun Chanthy was sentenced in absentia as he was unable to travel from a provincial prison to attend court in Phnom Penh due to travel sickness. He joins a long list of politicians, journalists and labor and environmental activists in Cambodia imprisoned after speaking out against the government, which has been led by the Cambodian People's Party for four decades. Cambodia's justice ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the sentence. For years the government has denied curtailing free speech and cracking down on its opponents, saying those jailed or subjected to legal action had broken the law. The CPP government has led a ruthless, years-long crackdown on its opponents, with scores of politicians jailed, many in absentia, and hundreds more fleeing into exile. Sun Chanthy formed the Nation Power Party in 2023 after Cambodia's only opposition, the Candlelight Party, was barred from an election last year that was won by the CPP in a landslide. According to human rights group LICADHO, which tracks cases against government critics, 102 people have been arrested and jailed in Cambodia this year, with 76 still in detention as of Dec. 10.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-opposition-politician-jailed-for-2-years-for-incitement/7914466.html	2024-12-26T03:04:59-08:00	
Japan Airlines suffers delays after carrier reports cyberattack	TOKYO — Japan Airlines reported a cyberattack on Thursday that caused delays to domestic and international flights but later said it had found and addressed the cause. The airline, Japan's second biggest after All Nippon Airways (ANA), said 24 domestic flights had been delayed by more than half an hour. Public broadcaster NHK said problems with the airline's baggage check-in system had caused delays at several Japanese airports but no major disruption was reported. 'We identified and addressed the cause of the issue. We are checking the system recovery status,' Japan Airlines (JAL) said in a post on social media platform X. 'Sales for both domestic and international flights departing today have been suspended. We apologize for any inconvenience caused,' the post said. A JAL spokesperson told AFP earlier the company had been subjected to a cyberattack. Japanese media said it may have been a so-called DDoS attack aimed at overwhelming and disrupting a website or server. Network disruption began at 7:24 a.m. Thursday (2224 GMT Wednesday), JAL said in a statement, adding that there was no impact on the safety of its operations. Then 'at 8:56 a.m., we temporarily isolated the router (a device for exchanging data between networks) that was causing the disruption,' it said. Report on January collision JAL shares fell as much as 2.5% in morning trade after the news emerged, before recovering slightly. The airline is just the latest Japanese firm to be hit by a cyberattack. Japan's space agency JAXA was targeted in 2023, although no sensitive information about rockets or satellites was accessed. The same year one of Japan's busiest ports was hit by a ransomware attack blamed on the Russia-based Lockbit group. In 2022, a cyberattack at a Toyota supplier forced the top-selling automaker to halt operations at domestic plants. More recently, the popular Japanese video-sharing website Niconico came under a large cyberattack in June. Separately, a transport ministry committee tasked with probing a fatal January 2024 collision involving a JAL passenger jet released an interim report on Wednesday blaming human error for the incident that killed five people. The collision at Tokyo's Haneda Airport was with a coast guard plane carrying six crew members -- of whom five were killed -- that was on mission to deliver relief supplies to a quake-hit central region of Japan. According to the report, the smaller plane's pilot mistook an air traffic control officer's instructions to mean authorization had been given to enter the runway. The captain was also 'in a hurry' at the time because the coast guard plane's departure was 40 minutes behind schedule, the report said. The traffic controller failed to notice the plane had intruded into the runway, oblivious even to an alarm system warning against its presence. All 379 people on board the JAL Airbus escaped just before the aircraft was engulfed in flames.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-airlines-suffers-delays-after-carrier-reports-cyberattack/7914450.html	2024-12-26T02:40:25-08:00	
South Korea's opposition moves to impeach acting president	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's opposition said Thursday it filed an impeachment motion against acting president Han Duck-soo, in an escalating dispute over the composition of the Constitutional Court which would decide whether to remove his predecessor from office. South Korea fell in a political crisis when President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, declared martial law on Dec. 3. Yoon was stripped of his duties by parliament on Dec. 14 over the dramatic declaration, but a constitutional court ruling upholding the decision by lawmakers is necessary to complete the impeachment process. The court is, however, currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon. The opposition wants Han to approve three more nominees to fill the nine-member bench, something that he has so far refused to do, essentially leaving both sides in a deadlock. The opposition Democratic Party therefore says the acting president should be impeached too. 'We have filed the motion... and will report it to the plenary session today,' MP Park Sung-joon told reporters at the National Assembly of the action against Han. 'We will put it to a vote tomorrow.' Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges proves that he 'does not have the will or qualification to uphold the constitution,' the Democratic Party's floor leader Park Chan-dae told reporters. Han has said that he would certify the judges' appointments only if his ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition reach a compromise on the nominees. 'The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,' Han argued. 'A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached,' added the 75-year-old career bureaucrat. If the opposition passes the impeachment motion against Han in Friday's vote, it would mark the first time democratic South Korea has impeached an acting president. In Han's place, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok would step in as acting president. Duty violated In the impeachment motion, the opposition accuses Han of violating his duty as acting president, citing his refusal to formally appoint the judges and promulgate two special probe bills to investigate Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law and graft allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. Earlier this week, Han rejected the opposition's demand for the special bills that would establish two independent investigative bodies to probe the first couple, prompting warnings of impeachment from the Democratic Party. Han is 'intentionally avoiding the special investigation to probe those involved in the insurrection and has clearly stated his intention to reject the appointments of three Constitutional Court judges,' the motion reads. Such actions, it adds, are 'in violation of a public official's duty to uphold the law... and serve the public.' If the opposition succeeds in their bid on Friday, South Korea will see its second impeachment of a head of state in less than two weeks, further destabilizing its vibrant political scene. Separately, Yoon faces criminal charges of insurrection over his martial law declaration, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty. Yoon was ordered a third time on Thursday to appear for questioning on the morning of the 29th, days after he refused a summons to do so on Christmas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-opposition-moves-to-impeach-acting-president/7914444.html	2024-12-26T02:27:56-08:00	
Pope opens special 'Holy Door' for Catholic Jubilee at Rome prison	ROME — Pope Francis made a visit on Thursday to one of the largest prison complexes in Italy, opening a special 'Holy Door' for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, in what the Vatican said was the first such action by a Catholic pontiff. Speaking to hundreds of inmates, guards and staff at the Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of Rome, Francis said he wanted to open the door, part of the prison chapel, and one of only five that will be open during the Holy Year, to show that 'hope does not disappoint.' 'In bad moments, we can all think that everything is over,' said the pontiff. 'Do not lose hope. This is the message I wanted to give you. Do not lose hope.' Francis opened the Catholic Holy Year, also known as a Jubilee, on Tuesday. A Catholic Jubilee is considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. This Jubilee, dedicated to the theme of hope, will run through Jan. 6, 2026. Holy Years normally occur every 25 years, and usually involve the opening in Rome of four special 'Holy Doors,' which symbolize the door of salvation for Catholics. The doors, located at the papal basilicas in Rome, are only open during Jubilee years. The Vatican said the opening of the 'Holy Door' at Rome's Rebibbia prison was the first time such a door had been opened by a pope at a prison since the start of the Jubilee year tradition by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300. Francis has shown special attention for the incarcerated over his 11-year papacy. He often visits prisons in Rome and on his foreign trips.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-opens-special-holy-door-for-catholic-jubilee-at-rome-prison/7914441.html	2024-12-26T02:16:29-08:00	
BYD contractor denies 'slavery-like conditions' claims by Brazilian authorities	SHANGHAI/BEIJING — Jinjiang Group, a contractor for Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, said Thursday that Brazilian authorities' portrayal of their employees as 'enslaved' was inconsistent with the facts and that there were translation misunderstandings. Brazilian labor authorities had on Wednesday said they found 163 Chinese nationals working in 'slavery-like conditions' at a construction site for a BYD-owned factory in Brazil's Bahia state. BYD said then that it had cut ties with the firm that hired the workers and was working with authorities. 'Being unjustly labeled as 'enslaved' has made our employees feel that their dignity has been insulted and their human rights violated, seriously hurting the dignity of the Chinese people. We have signed a joint letter to express our true feelings,' Jinjiang said on its official Weibo account. Their statement was reposted by Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, on his own Weibo account. He accused 'foreign forces' and some Chinese media of 'deliberately smearing Chinese brands and the country and undermining the relationship between China and Brazil.' A BYD representative directed Reuters to Li's Weibo post when asked about Jinjiang's comments and the situation. Jinjiang did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. BYD has been building the factory as part of plans to start production in Brazil in 2024 or early 2025. The factory is envisioned to have an initial capacity of producing 150,000 cars annually in Brazil, the Chinese EV giant's largest overseas market. Brazil is poised to hike tariffs on imported EVs to 35% in July 2026 from 18% currently. On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the Chinese Embassy in Brazil was communicating with Brazilian counterparts to verify the situation and handle it. Jinjiang said there had been translation and cultural difference issues that had led to the situation, and that the questions from the Brazilian inspectors had been 'suggestive.' It also posted a video showing a group of Chinese workers in front of the camera with one of them reading out a letter that Jinjiang said the workers have jointly signed. The letter said, for instance, that 107 workers had handed their passports to the company for help with applying for a temporary ID certificate in Brazil. The Brazilian labor inspectors had said that the workers had had their passports withheld by the company. 'We are very happy to come to Camacari to work,' an unidentified Chinese male said in the video. 'We have been complying with laws and regulations, working hard during the period with a hope that the construction of the biggest new energy vehicle project in Brazil could be completed as soon as possible,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/byd-contractor-denies-slavery-like-conditions-claims-by-brazilian-authorities/7914439.html	2024-12-26T02:07:07-08:00	
Rural communities urged to flee east Australia bushfire	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Australian authorities urged people in dozens of rural communities on Thursday to leave home 'immediately' to escape an out-of-control bushfire tearing through a national park. About 600 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Grampians National Park, 240 kilometers west of the city of Melbourne, a Victoria state emergency services spokesperson said. The blaze has persisted for more than a week in hot, windy conditions, scorching 55,000 hectares -- about one-third of the park -- so far without causing deaths or destroying homes. State emergency services warned residents to leave home immediately in more than two dozen mostly small rural communities, with populations ranging from as few as six to as many as several hundred. People in several other communities were told to take shelter indoors because it was unsafe to leave. Firefighters expected shifting winds to complicate their task during the day, said Victoria state control center spokesperson Luke Hegarty. 'We are reaching a critical part of the day when we see the wind change moving through the western part of the state,' Hegarty said in an afternoon update. 'We're expecting strong winds and variable winds to be a concern for us over the next few hours.' A total fire ban was declared across the whole of Victoria, a state located in southeastern Australia, barring any fires in the open air.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rural-communities-urged-to-flee-east-australia-bushfire/7914420.html	2024-12-26T01:16:47-08:00	
Sri Lanka train memorial honors tsunami tragedy	PERALIYA, SRI LANKA — Just inland from the crashing waves on Sri Lanka's palm-fringed shores, the train slowly came to a stop on Thursday -- marking the moment a deadly tsunami hit 20 years ago. Sri Lanka's Ocean Queen Express became a symbol of the biggest natural disaster to hit the South Asian nation in living memory, when the train was struck by the giant waves of Dec. 26, 2004. About 1,000 people were killed -- both passengers and local residents, who had clambered inside desperately seeking shelter after the first wave hit. After they boarded, two bigger waves smashed into the train, ripping it from the tracks and tumbling it onto its side more than 100 meters from the shoreline. Each year since then, the Ocean Queen has stopped on the tsunami anniversary at the spot in Peraliya, a sleepy village some 90 kilometers south of the capital Colombo, to commemorate those killed. 'To me, it all brings back the very hard memories,' said Tekla Jesenthu, whose 2-year-old daughter died as the waves hit the area. 'I don't want to think about or talk about it -- it hurts that much.' 'Monuments won't bring them back,' she added. Climbing for survival Survivors and relatives of the dead boarded the train in Colombo early in the morning before it headed south with national flags fluttering on its front and then slowed to a creaking halt in commemoration. Villagers came out, the line was closed, and a few moments of quiet settled. Mourners offered flowers and lit incense at a beachside memorial for 1,270 people buried in mass graves, with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim ceremonies held. 'When I saw the first wave, I started running away from the waves,' said U. A. Kulawathi, 73, a mother whose daughter was killed, her body swept out to sea. 'The water reached the roof levels and people climbed the roofs to save themselves.' The 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island triggered huge waves that swept into coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other nations around the Indian Ocean basin. A total of 226,408 people died as a result of the tsunami according to EM-DAT, a recognized global disaster database. Of those, 35,399 were in Sri Lanka. Sarani Sudeshika, 36, a baker whose mother-in-law was among those killed, recalled how 'animals started making strange noises and people started shouting, saying, 'Seawater is coming.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-train-memorial-honors-tsunami-tragedy/7914416.html	2024-12-26T01:07:09-08:00	
World Bank raises China's GDP forecast for 2024, 2025	The World Bank raised on Thursday its forecast for China's economic growth in 2024 and 2025, but warned that subdued household and business confidence, along with headwinds in the property sector, would keep weighing it down next year. The world's second-biggest economy has struggled this year, mainly due to a property crisis and tepid domestic demand. An expected hike in U.S. tariffs on its goods when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January may also negatively impact China’s growth. 'Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances, will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,' Mara Warwick, the World Bank's country director for China, said. 'It is important to balance short-term support to growth with long-term structural reforms,' she said in a statement. Thanks to the effect of recent policy easing and near-term export strength, the World Bank sees China's gross domestic product growth at 4.9% this year, up from its June forecast of 4.8%. Beijing set a growth target of 'around 5%' this year, a goal it says it is confident of achieving. Although growth for 2025 is also expected to fall to 4.5%, that is still higher than the World Bank's earlier forecast of 4.1%. Slower household income growth and the negative wealth effect from lower home prices are expected to weigh on consumption into 2025, the Bank said. To revive growth, Chinese authorities have agreed to issue a record $411 billion in special treasury bonds next year, Reuters reported this week. The figures will not be officially unveiled until the annual meeting of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in March 2025, and could still change before then. While the housing regulator will continue efforts to stem further declines in China's real estate market next year, the World Bank said a turnaround in the sector was not anticipated until late 2025. China's middle class has expanded significantly since the 2010s, encompassing 32% of the population in 2021, but World Bank estimates suggest about 55% remain 'economically insecure,' underscoring the need to generate opportunities for citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-raises-china-s-gdp-forecast-for-2024-2025-/7914410.html	2024-12-26T00:33:40-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 20 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 20 of the 31 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed five Ukrainian aerial drones over the Volgograd, Voronezh and Belgorod regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram a drone attack damaged several apartment buildings and a house, but that no one was hurt. The latest round of aerial attacks between the two sides followed a more active than usual day of drone and missile assaults. U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday condemned a massive Russian attack that Ukraine’s military said included 106 drones and 78 missiles. 'The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the safety of its grid. Let me be clear: the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety,' Biden said in a statement. The United States, Biden said, 'has provided Ukraine with hundreds of air defense missiles, and more are on the way. I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia targeted energy infrastructure as part of an attempt to 'fight for a blackout in Ukraine.' Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement it struck critical energy infrastructure facilities that support Ukraine’s military. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-shot-down-20-russian-drones/7914405.html	2024-12-26T00:18:09-08:00	
Kyrgyzstan faces difficulties enforcing West's Russia sanctions	BISHKEK, KYRGYZSTAN — Experts say Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to enforce Western sanctions against companies supplying dual-use goods and equipment to Russia are constrained by opposition from business, limited bureaucratic resources, and unwillingness to antagonize the Kremlin. Since 2022, the U.S. and EU governments designated a dozen Kyrgyz companies as violators of international Russia sanctions. According to the U.S. Treasury Department website, 'Entities based in the Kyrgyz Republic have been frequent exporters of controlled electronics components and other technology to Russia since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some of these shipments have subsequently supplied sensitive dual-use goods to entities in Russia’s defense sector.' There has been a significant rise in trade between Kyrgyzstan and Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with this year’s Kyrgyz exports to Russia through November up 47% from the same period last year, according to the Kyrgyz State Statistical Committee. Kyrgyzstan and Russia are both part of the Eurasian Economic Union, which also includes Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. As some media reports have claimed, the Kremlin has relied on Kyrgyzstan’s membership in the bloc as a backdoor channel for sanctions evasion. Western actions targeting Kyrgyz companies have irked Kyrgyz officials, but they have taken a series of measures to avoid more sanctions. In October 2022, Kyrgyz banks stopped processing transactions with Russian MIR cards, the go-to payment system for Russian citizens. In August of this year, the Kyrgyz government set up a new government State Trading Company to engage in external trade and monitor private import and export transactions. A month later, a government decree obliged Kyrgyz banks to suspend monetary transactions of all local and foreign companies involved in reexporting goods from China, South Korea and the EU through Kyrgyzstan to Russia. The State Trading Company has been exempted from this requirement. Kyrgyz officials have portrayed the measures as effective, with Economy and Trade Minister Daniyar Amangeldiev saying in October, 'We have obligations, and we are fulfilling them. Accordingly, such [sanctioned] goods never came to us, and they didn’t go through our territory.' However, regional experts paint a different picture. Bishkek political analyst Emil Juraev told VOA by email that Kyrgyzstan has limited capacity to enforce Western sanctions. 'It is the purview of the [Kyrgyz] Customs Service, which must have full information about what kind of goods are being exported and imported. That way, it would be possible to see what is being shipped to Russia. But in our country, such [sanctioned] goods are brought through contraband [channels],' he said. Meanwhile, the government action to control external trade through State Trade Company has caused consternation among Kyrgyz businesses. Askar Sydykov, head of the International Business Council, a Bishkek-based business association, told an Oct. 15 roundtable in Bishkek the number of commercial transactions can reach hundreds and thousands, which may be beyond the capacity of the government to deal with. 'Given that the company has been created only recently and it lacks experience in such transactions,' he said, referring to the State Trading Company, 'this can have significant [negative] implications on the country's interests and profitability of the banking sector and business community.' Sydykov also added that Kyrgyz entrepreneurs have vague ideas about what constitutes sanctioned 'dual use goods,' implying that Kyrgyz authorities need to do more to raise awareness of the issue among exporting businesses. Kyrgyz authorities have also grappled with punishing companies involved in sanctions evasion. As of December, the Kyrgyz government only revoked registration of two Kyrgyz companies that were included on the U.S. sanctions list. 'Closing down a few companies will not make big difference,' a Kyrgyzstani entrepreneur whose company imports goods from China told VOA, on condition that she be identified by only her first name, Nazira. 'Hundreds of [Kyrgyz] companies are involved in this business,' she said, referring to sanctions evasion. Fears of antagonizing Russia At a Nov. 25 news conference, Russian Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Sergei Vakunov took a jab at Western secondary sanctions against Kyrgyz companies, portraying them as 'direct interference of foreign countries into affairs of a sovereign country such as Kyrgyzstan.' A Kyrgyzstani political analyst, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity out of fear of official retribution, said that the Kyrgyz government is loath to take measures that can antagonize Russia. In an early October interview with Russia state media, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov criticized Western pressure on Kyrgyzstan. Traveling around Europe, he said, he hears EU officials on one hand say Russia should be punished for the invasion of Ukraine but those countries continue to cooperate with Russia. 'They should not tell us or ask us not to cooperate with Russia or the CIS,' he said, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of a number of former Soviet republics. Western diplomats apparently know that putting too much pressure can push Kyrgyzstan closer to Russia. In a March interview with Kyrgyz media, U.S. Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Lesslie Viguerie, said sanctions 'are not intended to prevent Kyrgyzstan from maintaining economic relations with Russia,' adding 'We do not pursue such a goal.' Nevertheless, Western governments are unwilling to reduce pressure on Kyrgyzstan. In late October, the U.S. government added four more Central Asian companies including one company from Kyrgyzstan to its sanctions list, a sign that illicit trade continues. Some experts doubt this latest measure will have impact. Joanna Lillis, a journalist based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the author of Dark Shadows: Inside the Secret World of Kazakhstan, told VOA, 'It is clear that the current system is not acting as a sufficient deterrent, and that further measures should be taken to thwart this trade.' 'It is possible,' she said, 'that singling out individuals for sanctions rather than companies might boost the deterrent factor.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyrgyzstan-faces-difficulties-enforcing-west-s-russia-sanctions/7914401.html	2024-12-26T00:07:34-08:00	
China to build world's largest hydropower dam in Tibet	BEIJING — China has approved the construction of what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, kicking off an ambitious project on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau that could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh. The dam, which will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, could produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, according to an estimate provided in 2020 by the Power Construction Corp of China. That would more than triple the 88.2 billion kWh designed capacity of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest, in central China. The project will play a major role in meeting China's carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, stimulate related industries such as engineering, and create jobs in Tibet, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday. A section of the Yarlung Zangbo falls a dramatic 2,000 meters within a short span of 50 kilometers, offering huge hydropower potential as well as unique engineering challenges. The outlay for building the dam, including engineering costs, is also expected to eclipse the Three Gorges dam, which cost 254.2 billion yuan, or $34.83 billion. This included the resettling of the 1.4 million people it displaced and was more than four times the initial estimate of $7.8 billion. Authorities have not indicated how many people the Tibet project would displace and how it would affect the local ecosystem, one of the richest and most diverse on the plateau. But according to Chinese officials, hydropower projects in Tibet, which they say hold more than a third of China's hydroelectric power potential, would not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies. India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns about the dam, with the project potentially altering not only the local ecology but also the flow and course of the river downstream. The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra river as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India's Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states and finally into Bangladesh. China has already commenced hydropower generation on the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo, which flows from the west to the east of Tibet. It is planning more projects upstream.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-build-world-s-largest-hydropower-dam-in-tibet/7914400.html	2024-12-25T23:55:56-08:00	
Israeli strike kills 5 journalists, Palestinian channel says	Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike early Thursday killed five journalists in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. The Al-Quds Today television channel, which is affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group, said in a statement the strike hit a broadcast truck and killed its five staffers. The channel said the group was killed 'while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty.' The Israeli military said its forces struck a vehicle containing Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Nuseirat area. A baby girl froze to death in southern Gaza, the head of the enclave's Ministry of Health said Wednesday. The newborn is at least the third baby to die in recent days in the cold. The girl's father, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, told The Associated Press that he had wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in the family's tent in the al-Muwasi camp outside of Khan Younis. 'It was very cold overnight and, as adults, we couldn't even take it. We couldn't stay warm,' he said. Baby Sila woke up crying three times in the night. In the morning, 'she was like wood,' he said. They rushed her to a field hospital, but she did not survive. Sila 'died from the cold,' her mother, Nariman, told CNN on Wednesday. 'I was warming her and holding her. But … [we] didn't have extra clothes for me to warm this girl.' The overnight low was 9 degrees Celsius, and their tent did not keep the wind out, Mahmood al-Faseeh said. Dr. Ahmed Al-Farra, the children's ward director at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, confirmed the baby died of hypothermia, as did two others, both less than 1 month old, in the past two days. According to The Associated Press, Israel is allowing more aid into Gaza: an average of 130 trucks a day in December, up from about 70 in October and November. Before the war, about 500 trucks entered daily. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,300 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

French authorities rescue 107 migrants crossing Channel	LILLE, FRANCE — French authorities said they rescued 107 migrants trying to cross the Channel from France to England on Wednesday. Over the course of Christmas Day, 12 rescue operations were staged along the coast of northern France, including of a boat experiencing engine trouble, France's Channel and North Sea maritime prefecture said in a statement. In the morning, 30 passengers were rescued from a boat near Dunkirk, while the others onboard wished to continue onward and were taken into British custody once they reached British waters, the maritime authorities said. Another boat experiencing engine damage was spotted later in the day, also near Dunkirk, and all 51 passengers were rescued. Later, 26 people were taken off a boat having trouble near Calais. The English Channel is 'a particularly dangerous area, especially at the height of winter for precarious and overloaded boats,' the statement said. At least 73 migrants have died trying to cross the Channel to Britain in 2024, according to the Pas-de-Calais authorities, making it the deadliest year on record for the crossings. Tens of thousands more have reached Britain, where the government has vowed to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. In November, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for greater international cooperation against the gangs, which he described as a 'global security threat similar to terrorism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-authorities-rescue-107-migrants-crossing-channel/7914340.html	2024-12-25T18:51:13-08:00	
Desalination plant quietly resumes operations in Gaza	The quiet resumption of operations at a desalination plant in the Gaza Strip last month marked a small but significant step toward restoring public services in the Palestinian territory ravaged by more than 14 months of war. The process of restarting the plant in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, involved both Israeli and Palestinian stakeholders who could have a hand in the territory's future, especially amid renewed hopes for a ceasefire in recent days. While its reopening has had a limited tangible impact so far, diplomats close to the project suggest it could offer a tentative road map for Gaza's postwar administration. Since being reconnected to Israel's electricity grid, the station has been producing about 16,000 cubic meters of water per day, according to UNICEF. It serves more than 600,000 Gaza residents through tankers or the networks of Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis governorates in central and southern Gaza, respectively. 'Its production capacity remains limited in the face of immense needs,' an official within the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority told AFP. Residents of the devastated Palestinian territory have struggled since the early days of the war between Israel and Hamas to secure even basic necessities, including food and clean water. The WASH Cluster, which brings together humanitarian organizations in the water sector, reports that distribution of water has become very complex in Gaza. The pipelines transporting water have been damaged, leaving Gazans, many of whom are living in makeshift shelters after being displaced by bombardments, without any means of storing the essential resource. Three plants The plant is one of three such seawater processing facilities in the Gaza Strip, which before the war met around 15% of the 2.4 million residents' needs. In the months following the outbreak of war, sparked by the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the plant operated at minimal capacity, relying on solar panels and generators amid a persistent scarcity of fuel in Gaza. It could fully resume operations only after reconnecting to one of the power lines supplied by Israel, which charges the Palestinian Authority for the electricity. UNICEF, which provides technical support for the Deir el-Balah plant, indicated in late June that it had reached an agreement with Israel to restore electricity to the plant. Subsequently, COGAT, a division of Israel's defense ministry overseeing civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, announced that the desalination plant had been reconnected to the Israeli grid. But the line meant to supply the plant was heavily damaged. 'It took five months to repair the line from Kissufim' in Israel, said Mohammed Thabet, spokesman for Gaza's electricity company. 'These are emergency, temporary solutions.' Several diplomatic sources told AFP that the episode showed the Palestinian Authority proved it was in a position to have a hand in the future governance of Gaza, as its institutions were fixing the electricity line on the ground, coordinating with all actors. The authority aims to play a central role in postwar Gaza, seeking to strengthen its influence in the territory after it was significantly weakened when Hamas took control in 2007. An Israeli security source told AFP that the Israeli partners involved had acted on 'instructions from the political echelons,' and that the project was part of an effort to prevent an outbreak of disease, which could endanger the lives of hostages still held in Gaza. When Hamas militants attacked Israel last year, they abducted about 250 hostages, of whom about 100 are still held in Gaza, including the more than 30 who the Israeli military says are dead. Israel 'facilitated the connection of the electric line specifically to the desalination plant,' the source said, adding that a mechanism was in place to track usage to 'prevent electricity from being stolen.' Israeli authorities' cooperation on the plant's reopening comes soon after it agreed to work with a U.N.-led polio vaccination drive, pausing its bombing campaign in Gaza in areas where children were receiving the doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desalination-plant-quietly-resumes-operations-in-gaza/7914345.html	2024-12-25T18:48:01-08:00	
Taiwan Defense Ministry warns new laws could have 'serious impact' on security	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan's Defense Ministry warned of 'serious impact' to security after opposition parties passed laws that require a cut in defense spending of about $2.45 billion as the island is facing an elevated Chinese military threat. Taiwan's opposition parties, which hold a majority in parliament, last week passed legislation to shift spending from the central government to local municipalities, a move strongly contested by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and thousands of protesters. In a statement late Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it might need to cut its defense budget plan by 28% for next year, equivalent to around $2.45 billion, to meet the new funding requirements. 'It is set to deliver a serious impact to the national forces' military buildup and combat preparedness,' the ministry said. Upgrades to some equipment will not continue, and it will be difficult to make payments for purchased items in accordance with contracts, resulting in delays or cancellations, it said. The ministry said the defense budget for next year amounted to about 2.4% of Taiwan's gross domestic product, but the possible cut would take the sum below 2%, even as other countries in the region are increasing military spending. 'How do we persuade international friends to help us in critical moments when the enemy is invading us?' the ministry said. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has ramped up military pressure in recent years to assert those claims, which Taipei strongly rejects. Joseph Wu, secretary-general of Taiwan's National Security Council, told reporters on Wednesday that more discussions were needed because the budget cut would lead to 'serious consequences.' He did not give details, but said the cut would 'send a wrong message that Taiwan does not want to defend itself. Seeing that, like-minded countries might not want to help our nation.' The Cabinet in August proposed a 7.7% year-on-year rise for military spending to $19.8 billion, a record high for Taiwan as the island adds fighter jets and missiles to strengthen deterrence against the rising threat from Beijing. The DPP lost its parliamentary majority in January elections and is in a standoff with the opposition on several issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-defense-ministry-warns-new-laws-could-have-serious-impact-on-security-/7914337.html	2024-12-25T18:25:47-08:00	
Turkey's soaring costs creating 'lost generation' of children	ISTANBUL — In a dim one-room apartment in one of Istanbul's poorest neighborhoods, 11-year-old Atakan Sahin curls up on a threadbare sofa with his siblings to watch TV while their mother stirs a pot of pasta. The simple meal is all the family of six can look forward to most evenings. Atakan, his two younger brothers and 5-year-old sister are among the one-third of Turkish children living in poverty. 'Look at the state of my children,' said Rukiye Sahin, 28. 'I have four children. They don't get to eat chicken, they don't get to eat meat. I send them to school with torn shoes.' Persistently high inflation, triggered by currency depreciation and unconventional economic policies that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pursued but later abandoned, has left many families struggling to pay for food and housing. Experts say it's creating a lost generation of children who have been forced to grow up too quickly to help their families eke out an existence. According to a 2023 joint report by UNICEF and the Turkish Statistical Institute, about 7 million of Turkey's roughly 22.2 million children live in poverty. Look at neighborhoods such as Istanbul's Tarlabasi, where the Sahin family lives. The Sahins eat sitting on the floor of their room — the same floor Rukiye and her husband sleep on while their children occupy the sofas. In the chilly early December night, a stove burns scraps of wood to keep them warm. They sometimes fall asleep to the sound of rats scuttling through the building. Atakan spends his days helping his father scour trash bins in search of recyclable material to earn the family a meager income. Poor children in Istanbul also earn money for their families by selling small items such as pens, tissues or bracelets at the bars and cafes in the city's entertainment districts, often working late into the night. 'I can't go to school because I have no money,' Atakan said. 'We have nothing. Can you tell me how I can go? On sunny days, when I don't go to school, I collect plastic and other things with my father. We sell whatever we find.' The cash helps buy basic foodstuffs and pay for his siblings to attend school. On the days Atakan can attend, he is ill-equipped to succeed, lacking proper shoes, a coat and textbooks for the English class he loves. The Sahins struggle to scrape together the money to cover the rent, utilities and other basic expenses as Turkey's cost-of-living crisis continues to rage. Inflation stood at 47% in November, having peaked at 85% in late 2022. Prices of food and nonalcoholic drinks were 5.1% higher in November than in the previous month. Under these circumstances, a generation of children is growing up rarely enjoying a full meal of fresh meat or vegetables. Rukiye and her husband receive 6,000 lira ($173) per month in government welfare to help toward school costs, but they pay the same amount in rent for their home. 'My son says, 'Mom, it's raining, my shoes are soaking wet.' But what can I do?' Rukiye said. 'The state doesn't help me. I'm in this room alone with my children. Who do I have except them?' The picture of children rummaging through garbage to help support their families is far from the image Turkey presents to the world: that of an influential world power with a vibrant economy favorable to foreign investment. Speaking at the G20 summit in November, Erdogan described Turkey's social security system as 'one of the most comprehensive and inclusive' in the world. 'Our goal is to ensure that not a single poor person remains. We will continue our work until we achieve this,' he said. Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, tasked with implementing austerity and taming inflation, said the 17,000 lira ($488) monthly minimum wage isn't low. But he has pledged to raise it as soon as possible. Although the government allocates billions of lira to struggling households, inflation eats into any aid the state can give. Experts say welfare payments aren't enough for the millions who rely on them. Volunteers are trying to ease the cycle of deprivation. Mehmet Yeralan, 53, a former restaurant owner, brings essentials to Tarlabasi's poor people, including coats, notebooks and the occasional bag of rice. 'Families are in very difficult situations,' he said. 'They cannot buy food for their children and send them to school. Children are on the streets, selling tissues to support their families. We are seeing deep poverty here.' Hacer Foggo, a poverty researcher and activist, said children are forced to drop out of school to work or are channeled into vocational programs where they work four days and study one day per week, receiving a small fraction of the minimum wage. 'Look at the situation of children,' she said. 'Two million of them are in deep poverty. Child labor has become very common. Families choose these education-work programs because children bring in some income. It's not a real education, just cheaper labor.' UNICEF placed Turkey 38th out of 39 European Union or Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of child poverty between 2019 and 2021, with a child poverty rate of 34%. It is a situation Rukiye fully understands. 'We can't move forward, we always fall behind. ... When you don't have money in your hands, you always fall behind,' she said. Her eldest son, meanwhile, clings to his childhood dreams. 'I want to go to school regularly.' Atakan said. 'I want everything to be in order. … I'd like to be a football player one day, to support my family.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-soaring-costs-creating-lost-generation-of-children/7914317.html	2024-12-25T17:07:02-08:00	
Asia to mourn tsunami dead with ceremonies on 20th anniversary	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — Emotional ceremonies were expected across Asia on Thursday to remember the 220,000 people who died two decades ago when a tsunami devastated coastal areas around the Indian Ocean in one of the worst natural disasters in human history. On Dec. 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's western tip generated a series of massive waves that pummeled the coastline of 14 countries from Indonesia to Somalia. Beachside memorials and religious ceremonies will be held across Asia in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, which were the worst hit countries. 'I hope we will never experience that ever again,' said Nilawati, a 60-year-old Indonesian housewife who lost her son and mother in the tragedy. 'I learned the devastation of losing a child, a grief I can't explain with words,' she said. 'It feels like it just happened yesterday. Whenever I am reminded of it, it feels like all the blood rushes out of my body.' Victims of waves as high as 30 meters included many foreign tourists celebrating Christmas on the region's sun-kissed beaches, bringing the tragedy into homes around the globe. The seabed being ripped open pushed waves at double the speed of a bullet train, crossing the Indian Ocean within hours without warning. A total of 226,408 people died because of the tsunami, according to EM-DAT, a recognized global disaster database. There was no warning of the impending tsunami, giving little time for evacuation, despite the hourslong gaps between the waves striking different continents. But today a sophisticated network of monitoring stations has cut down warning times. Indonesia suffered the highest death toll, with more than 160,000 people killed along its western coast. In its westernmost province, Aceh, mourners were to hold a moment of silence before visits to a mass grave and a communal prayer at the grand mosque in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. The disaster also ended a decadeslong separatist conflict in Aceh, with a peace deal between rebels and Jakarta struck less than a year later. In Sri Lanka, where more than 35,000 people perished, survivors and relatives were to gather to remember around 1,000 victims who died when waves derailed a passenger train. The mourners will board the restored Ocean Queen Express and head to Peraliya — the exact spot where it was ripped from the tracks, around 90 kilometers south of Colombo. A brief religious ceremony will be held with relatives of the dead there while Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim ceremonies are also organized to commemorate victims across the South Asian island nation. In Thailand, where half of the more than 5,000 dead were foreign tourists, unofficial vigils were expected to accompany a government memorial ceremony. At a hotel in Phang Nga province, there will be a tsunami exhibition, a documentary screening and introductions by government and U.N. bodies on disaster preparedness and resilience measures. Nearly 300 people were killed as far away as Somalia, as well as more than 100 in the Maldives and dozens in Malaysia and Myanmar. 'My children, wife, father, mother, all of my siblings were swept away,' said Indonesian survivor and fisherman Baharuddin Zainun, 70. 'The same tragedy was felt by others as well. We feel the same feelings.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/asia-to-mourn-tsunami-dead-with-ceremonies-on-20th-anniversary/7914305.html	2024-12-25T16:40:33-08:00	
Finland-Estonia electricity cable outage is latest Baltic Sea incident	HELSINKI — An undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia suffered an outage Wednesday, Finland's prime minister said, the latest in a series of incidents involving telecom cables and energy pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Arto Pahkin, the head of operations of the Finnish electricity grid, told public broadcaster Yle that 'the possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out.' Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the power outage 'does not affect electricity supplies for Finns.' 'The authorities remain vigilant even during Christmas and are investigating the situation,' he added on X. Operator Fingrid said current on the EstLink 2 cable sending electricity to Estonia was cut at 12:26 p.m. local time. Last month two telecom cables in the Baltic linking neighboring Sweden and Denmark were cut. Suspicions rapidly fell on the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3, which according to ship tracking sites had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut. Sweden said Monday that China had denied a request for prosecutors to conduct an investigation on the vessel and that it had left the area. European officials said they suspected several of the incidents were sabotage linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the Kremlin dismissing that as absurd. Early on November 17, the Arelion cable running from the Swedish island of Gotland to Lithuania was damaged. The next day, the C-Lion 1 submarine cable connecting Helsinki and the German port of Rostock was cut south of Sweden's Oland island. Tensions have mounted around the Baltic since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-estonia-electricity-cable-outage-is-latest-baltic-sea-incident-/7914297.html	2024-12-25T16:29:58-08:00	
Kosovo appeals panel lets ethnic Serb party run in parliamentary election	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's election appeals authority on Wednesday canceled a ban on the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, allowing it to field candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The Electoral Panel for Complaints and Appeals decided that the party, Srpska Lista, or Serb List, has 'fulfilled the political terms to be certified for registration.' The panel overturned a decision Monday by the Central Election Commission, which declined to certify the Srpska Lista party because of its nationalist stance and close ties to neighboring Serbia. The panel ruled that the commission's decision was 'contrary to the legal dispositions referring to the application and certification of the political subjects.' Of the 10 seats reserved for the Serb minority in the 120-member parliament, Srspka Lista holds nine. It will put up 48 candidates for the parliamentary election on February 9, expected to be a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti, whose governing party won in a landslide in 2021. Western powers also expressed concern about the commission's decision, fearing it might further aggravate the tense ties between Kosovo and Serbia, despite their efforts to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The war left about 11,400 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn't recognize. Belgrade still considers Kosovo as its province and has a major influence on the Serb minority there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-appeals-panel-lets-ethnic-serb-party-run-in-parliamentary-election/7914044.html	2024-12-25T15:09:14-08:00

Trial moved for man accused in Trump assassination attempt in Florida	ORLANDO, FLORIDA — A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September, a federal judge ruled this week. Ryan Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday. Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty. Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense. Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida. In her order, Cannon said that she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an 'unreasonable delay,' she said. The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February. Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate. Routh's charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence if he is convicted. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami. Routh's arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-moved-for-man-accused-in-trump-assassination-attempt-in-florida/7914025.html	2024-12-25T14:01:03-08:00	
More than 1,500 prisoners escape in Mozambique amid post-election unrest	Maputo, Mozambique — More than 1,500 prisoners escaped from a prison near Maputo on Wednesday, taking advantage of the third day of unrest triggered by the controversial confirmation of the long-ruling Frelimo party as the winner of recent elections. A total of 1,534 detainees escaped the high-security prison located about 15 kilometers from the capital, national police chief Bernardino Rafael said at a press conference. Among those attempting to escape, 33 were killed and 15 were wounded in clashes with prison staff, he added. A search, backed by the army, led to the arrests of about 150 fugitives, he said. Around 30 of the prisoners were linked to armed groups that have been behind unrest and attacks in the northern province of Cabo Delgado for the past seven years. 'We are particularly concerned about this situation,' Rafael said. The Portuguese-speaking African country's highest court confirmed on Monday that Frelimo, in power since 1975, won the October 9 presidential election, which had already triggered weeks of unrest. Groups of protesters approached the penitentiary on Wednesday, creating confusion and triggering unrest inside, where inmates ended up knocking down a wall through which they escaped, Rafael said. Barricades remained in several areas of the capital Wednesday, limiting movements, as acts of vandalism continued. In addition to the ransacking of stores and public buildings Monday, ambulances were set ablaze along with a drugstore and other businesses, according to an AFP correspondent. Some demonstrators also set up tables in the streets to occupy the space while celebrating Christmas with family or neighbors, an AFP journalist witnessed in several working-class districts of Maputo. Monday's confirmation of the election results came despite claims of irregularities from many observers. Frelimo leader Daniel Chapo won 65.17% of the vote, about 5 percentage points less than the initial results declared by the country's electoral commission. Chapo's main challenger, exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane, has claimed the election was rigged, sparking fears of violence between rival party supporters. The unrest has led to the deaths of at least 150 people, according to reports from several nongovernmental organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-1-500-prisoners-escape-in-mozambique-amid-post-election-unrest/7913994.html	2024-12-25T13:16:25-08:00	
Desi Bouterse, dictator convicted of murder who ruled Suriname, dies at 79	PARAMARIBO, SURINAME — Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who led a 1980 coup in the former Dutch colony of Suriname then returned to power by election three decades later despite charges of drug smuggling and murder, has died. He was 79. Surinamese President Chan Santokhi on Wednesday reflected on Bouterse's outsized legacy in a message of condolences to his family and called on the nation to 'keep calm and maintain order.' Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk wrote on Facebook that Bouterse’s 'life had a lasting impact on our country and his efforts will not be forgotten.' The cause of death was not immediately known. Bouterse was applauded by supporters for his charisma and populist social programs. For his opponents, he was a ruthless dictator who was convicted of drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings. In December 2023, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murders of 15 opponents of the then-military government in December 1982, ending a historic 16-year legal process. He then vanished and never served time in jail despite the sentencing. 'There is nobody who has shaped the history of Suriname since its independence like Desi Bouterse,' said Dutch historian Pepijn Reeser, who wrote a biography of Bouterse in 2015. He said that Bouterse was the first to overcome the stark social class divide that once defined Suriname. 'Before the coup, it was unthinkable somebody from the lower class could become the most powerful man of the country. But he was also the first post-colonial leader to resort to political violence, and the first to use Suriname as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics,' Reeser said. Early Wednesday, dozens of supporters gathered outside Bouterse’s home where his wife lived, tears streaming down their faces. Many were dressed in purple, the color of his political party. Born Oct. 13, 1945, at a former sugar plantation near the capital, Paramaribo, Bouterse left for the Netherlands in 1968, as did thousands of other Surinamers in that era to seek adventure or a better life in Europe. Suriname was then still a colony, and as a Dutch citizen he was eligible for conscription, so he joined the armed forces a few months after arriving. He graduated from the Royal Military School and served at several Dutch army bases in the Netherlands and Germany. Bouterse returned to Suriname two weeks before it became an independent republic on November 25, 1975, and joined its newly formed military. The initial optimism of young military men in serving their own country quickly turned into frustration over widespread favoritism and corruption in the consecutive governments of Prime Minister Henck Arron. When Arron forbade the troops from unionizing, 16 young soldiers led by Bouterse overthrew the government on February 25, 1980, and made him the de facto ruler. When promised democratic reforms did not materialize, opposition to Bouterse’s military regime grew rapidly. Frictions between the military and opposition groups culminated in the killing of 15 men on Dec. 8, 1982. The victims were journalists, lawyers, military and university teachers, and their slaying became known as the 'December Murders.' Shocked by the killings, the Netherlands suspended all development aid, disrupting life in Suriname. Ronnie Brunswijk, a former bodyguard of Bouterse, took up arms in 1986 in a bid to oust the dictator. For six years, the country’s jungles were torn by a civil war in which both sides violated human rights and hundreds died. International isolation and the lack of domestic support for his military regime led Bouterse to accept free elections in November 1987. He established his own political movement, the National Democratic Party, but won only three of 51 seats in Parliament. Nonetheless, as commander of the armed forces, Bouterse kept a tight grip on the newly elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar. Following a conflict between Bouterse and Shankar in 1990, the army seized power again, dismissing Shankar with a phone call. Civilian rule was restored the following year. Bouterse officially left Suriname’s army in 1993, and he became what he described as a fulltime politician and businessman. In 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the Netherlands. The absence of an extradition treaty between the nations meant he never served his time in prison. In 2007, Suriname’s military court started a trial against Bouterse and 24 others for their alleged roles in the December Murders of 1982. Bouterse was painted as the chief instigator by the prosecution. He maintained he was not present during the executions, although he said he accepted 'political responsibility' as army commander. While the trial dragged on for more than a decade, the former military leader reinvented himself as a politician by preaching nationalism and attracting support from many ethnic groups in Suriname, whose people have African, Asian, Amerindian, European and Middle Eastern roots. He was elected president for the first time in 2010. Instead of avoiding his past, he celebrated it. He quickly declared Feb. 25, the day of his military coup in 1980, a national holiday. He awarded other suspects in the December Murders case and coup plotters with high-ranking government jobs. Inspired by the socialist politics of then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bouterse continued construction of social housing, increased social welfare benefits and raised the government pension. These popular measures secured his reelection for another five-year term in 2015 but also proved to be an unpayable burden for the state. Large budget deficits and rampant inflation ensued. Consecutive devaluations of the Surinamese dollar in 2016 resulted in the currency losing more than half of its value in just a year. 'The reckless economic policies of Bouterse have put a huge burden on our future generations, who are forced to repay millions of dollars of loans to international creditors,' Surinamese economist Winston Ramautarsing told The Associated Press in 2016. With his support dwindling during his second term, Bouterse resorted to the tactics that he used during his dictatorship, including threatening the judges of his own murder trial during public events. History books for the country’s high schools that mentioned the December Murders were banned. He regularly fired Cabinet ministers while blaming them for Suriname’s problems. In 2012, the Bouterse administration proclaimed an internationally criticized amnesty law for the December Murders in an attempt to halt the murder trial. However, the law was ruled inapplicable by the military court in 2016, and in June 2017, the prosecutor recommended a 20-year prison sentence for Bouterse. 'If it was God who made me president; who is this judge to try to send me away?' Bouterse said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desi-bouterse-dictator-convicted-of-murder-who-ruled-suriname-dies-at-79/7913985.html	2024-12-25T13:15:55-08:00	
Clashes between Islamists now in power in Syria and Assad's supporters leave casualties	Damascus — Clashes between Islamists who took over Syria and supporters of ousted President Bashar Assad's government killed two Islamic fighters on Wednesday and wounded others, according to interim officials. The details of how the fighting erupted and who instigated the confrontation were not immediately known. Interim officials in Syria said two fighters were killed from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the stunning offensive that toppled Assad earlier this month. Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth but it’s only been a few weeks since Assad fled the country and his administration and forces melted away. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in fundamentalist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn’t clear how or whether they plan to share power. Since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and monitors, the majority of them from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam that Assad belongs to. In the capital, Damascus, Alawite protesters scuffled with Sunni counter-protesters and gunshots were heard. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the shooting. Alawite protests also took place along the coast of Syria, in the city of Homs and the Hama countryside. Some called for the release of soldiers from the former Syrian army now imprisoned by the HTS. The Alawite protests were apparently in part sparked by an online video showing the burning of an Alawite shrine. The interim authorities insisted the video was old and not a recent incident. Sectarian violence has erupted in bursts since Assad's ouster but nothing close to the level feared after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed an estimated half-million people. The war fractured Syria, creating millions of refugees and displacing tens of thousands throughout the country. This week, some Syrians who were forcibly displaced started trickling home, trying to rebuild their lives. Shocked by the devastation, many found that little remains of their houses. In the northwestern Idlib region, residents were repairing shops and sealing damaged windows on Tuesday, trying to bring back a sense of normalcy. The city of Idlib and much of the surrounding province have for years been under control of the HTS, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, once aligned with al-Qaida, but has been the scene of relentless attacks by the government forces. Hajjah Zakia Daemessaid, who was forcibly displaced during the war, said coming back to her house in the Idlib countryside was bitter-sweet. 'My husband and I spent 43 years of hard work saving money to build our home, only to find that all of it has gone to waste,' said the 62-year-old. In the dusty neighborhoods, cars drove by with luggage strapped on top. People stood idly on the streets or sat in empty coffee shops. In Damascus, Syria's new authorities raided warehouses on Wednesday, confiscating drugs such as Captagon and cannabis, used by Assad's forces. A million Captagon pills and hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cannabis were set ablaze, the interim authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-between-islamists-now-in-power-in-syria-and-assad-s-supporters-leave-casualties-/7913931.html	2024-12-25T11:37:48-08:00	
Israeli soldier who died 417 days after his Oct. 7 wounds becomes symbol of sacrifice	MODIIN, ISRAEL — For more than 400 days after being critically wounded during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel, Yona Brief tried to recover. But after losing both legs and enduring medically induced comas, the combat medic died in late November. The dual Israeli-American citizen has come to symbolize the sacrifice by hundreds of fallen soldiers in what many in Israel see as a war for the country’s survival. 'He became a symbol of ‘Don’t quit,’' said his mother, Hazel. His father, David, compared him to the oil that lit the candelabra in the Hanukkah story, miraculously burning longer than expected, according to Jewish tradition. More than 800 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Hamas’ attack, about 300 of them on the initial day and the rest in Gaza or in the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thousands of others have been wounded, many of them seriously. The war in Gaza has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians, while over 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to local health officials. Serving in Israel’s military is compulsory for most Jews. Soldiers’ service is revered, and Israelis see their sacrifice as deeply moving. Public opinion in previous wars has often been swayed by high soldier casualties. Injured previously Months before Brief was called into action on October 7, he had been seriously wounded, also in his legs, by a pipe bomb during a commando raid while serving in the occupied West Bank. The weekend of October 7 was his first on duty after his recovery. As militants attacked from Gaza, he and his seven-soldier commando unit raced to join the Israeli army’s house-by-house war in the communal farming villages, military bases and towns along the border. His father said Brief’s unit was ordered to clear the Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Hamas fighters ambushed them, killing two soldiers. When Brief rushed to help one of them, he was shot 13 times. Suddenly, his training as a medic was used to save himself. His father said he cinched tourniquets around his mutilated legs and dragged himself and a fellow soldier into a nearby bullet-ravaged home. There, the family of Hadas Eilon-Carmi hid in a reinforced room and later described Brief as the soldier 'full of blood.' Brief was evacuated to a hospital hours later. The other soldier, his commanding officer, died at the scene. The hospital stay was grueling, too. Brief was the most critically wounded patient from the October 7 attack to be treated at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, the country's largest hospital. After his legs were amputated, he teetered between life and death. He had more than 20 surgeries. His doctors told Israeli media he received more than 200 units of blood. The hospital brought specialists and surgeons from around the world in a bid to save him. Eilon-Carmi’s family became close with his family, visiting Brief in the hospital and praying for his recovery. 'Yona represents everything I want an Israeli to be,' she said. Often awake and lively Brief's determination to live became a source of inspiration for the doctors and medical staff, who had been overwhelmed by work and heartbreak in the early days of the war, said Steve Walz, the international spokesperson for Sheba Medical Center. Although there were periods when Brief was in a medically induced coma, he was often awake and lucid, even lively. He was grateful for what remained, his mother said. He worked out in his hospital bed, raising a barbell above his head. He sang and danced with visitors. Once, he even left the hospital to spend the night in his family home, but his medical issues brought him back. Brief’s parents said there were sparks of joy in the nearly 14 months after he was wounded. Chefs cooked him special meals such as sushi. Politicians and influencers visited, and Israel's top musicians played by his bedside. He turned 23. But while his parents said his spirit never wavered, his liver finally failed after months of heavy medication. Hundreds attended his funeral, and tributes poured in from all walks of Israeli life. 'With Yona, every day he had to fight for this victory and that’s why his heroism is extraordinary,' said Chili Tropper, an Israeli opposition lawmaker who became close with Brief and his family. 'For him, during 417 days, every single day was a war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-soldier-who-died-417-days-after-his-oct-7-wounds-becomes-symbol-of-sacrifice/7913895.html	2024-12-25T11:32:37-08:00	
Israel and Hamas accuse each other of complicating ceasefire efforts as they inch closer to deal	Jerusalem — Israel and Hamas accused each other of complicating ceasefire efforts on Wednesday, as the two sides inch closer to a deal that could wind down the 14-month war in Gaza. The two sides appear closer than they have been in months to reaching an agreement that would bring home dozens of hostages being held in Gaza. However, talks have come close before, only to collapse. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that progress was being made toward a deal, sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. On Wednesday, Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions related to the withdrawal from Gaza, the prisoners and the return of displaced people, which it said was delaying the deal. Israel's government accused Hamas of reneging on reneging on understandings that have already been reached.' Still, both sides said discussions are ongoing. Israel’s negotiating team, which includes members from its intelligence agencies and the military, returned from Qatar Tuesday evening for internal consultations, following a week of what it called 'significant negotiations.' During its October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued, or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. Sporadic talks have taken place for a year, but in recent weeks there's been a renewed push to reach a deal. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month for his second term, has demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages, saying on social media that if they're not freed before he is sworn in, there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' Families of the hostages are becoming increasingly angry, calling on the Israeli government for a ceasefire before Trump is sworn in. After Israel’s high-level negotiation team returned from Doha this week, hostage families called an emergency press conference in Tel Aviv, pleading for a ceasefire and a complete end to the war. Shir Siegel, the daughter of Israeli-American Keith Siegel, whose mother was released after more than 50 days in captivity, said every delay could endanger their lives. 'There are moments when every second is fateful, and this is one of those moments,' she said. The families are planning a special candle lighting ceremony in Hostages Square Wednesday, marking the first night of Hanukkah. The agreement would take effect in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion into Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-and-hamas-accuse-each-other-of-complicating-ceasefire-efforts-as-they-inch-closer-to-a-deal-/7913857.html	2024-12-25T10:52:16-08:00	
Israeli hostages' relatives light first candle of Hanukkah at Western Wall	Relatives of hostages held in Gaza lit the first candle of Hanukkah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Some relatives cried during the lighting while holding banners with images of their loved ones who are still held captive in Gaza after more than a year. 'Families of the hostages, we all pray that even today, they will return to Jerusalem, to the Holy Land, safe and well,' said Western Wall Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages, over one-third of whom are believed to be dead. The Israeli negotiating team working on a ceasefire returned from Qatar to Israel on Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said, after what it called 'a significant week' of talks. After months of deadlock, the United States, Qatar and Egypt resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to reach a deal. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the proposed agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was 'some progress' in efforts to reach a deal but added he did not know how long it would take.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-hostages-relatives-light-first-candle-of-hanukkah-at-western-wall/7913823.html	2024-12-25T10:21:41-08:00	
Pope urges 'all people of all nations' to silence arms and overcome divisions in Christmas address	Vatican City — Pope Francis in his traditional Christmas message on Wednesday urged 'all people of all nations' to find courage during this Holy Year 'to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions' plaguing the world, from the Middle East to Ukraine, Africa to Asia. The pontiff's 'Urbi et Orbi' — 'To the City and the World' — address serves as a summary of the woes facing the world this year. As Christmas coincided with the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that he dedicated to hope, Francis called for broad reconciliation, 'even [with] our enemies.' 'I invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,'' the pope said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to throngs of people below. The pope invoked the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica, which he opened on Christmas Eve to launch the 2025 Jubilee, as representing God’s mercy, which 'unties every knot; it tears down every wall of division; it dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge.' He called for arms to be silenced in war-torn Ukraine and in the Middle East, singling out Christian communities in Israel and the Palestinian territories, 'particularly in Gaza where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave,' as well as Lebanon and Syria 'at this most delicate time.' Francis repeated his calls for the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. He cited a deadly outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the suffering of the people of Myanmar, forced to flee their homes by 'the ongoing clash of arms.' The pope likewise remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, who have lost their jobs, and are persecuted for their faith. Pilgrims were lined up on Christmas Day to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica, as the Jubilee is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome. Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300. Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, the founder of the Roman Catholic Church. 'You feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions,'' said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. '... It’s almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. It’s just a beautiful experience.' A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a Hanukkah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa. While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. Iraqi Christians persist in their faith Christians in Nineveh Plains attended Christmas Mass on Tuesday at the Mar Georgis church in the center of Telaskaf, Iraq, with security concerns about the future. 'We feel that they will pull the rug out from under our feet at any time. Our fate is unknown here,' said Bayda Nadhim, a resident of Telaskaf. Iraq’s Christians, whose presence there goes back nearly to the time of Christ, belong to a number of rites and denominations. They once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq, estimated at around 1.4 million. But the community has steadily dwindled since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and further in 2014 when the Islamic State militant group swept through the area. The exact number of Christians left in Iraq is not clear, but they are thought to number several hundred thousand. German celebrations muted by market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying, 'There is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg.' He urged Germans to 'stand together' and that 'hate and violence must not have the last word.' A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspect’s X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat 'the Islamification of Germany' and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-urges-all-people-of-all-nations-to-silence-arms-and-overcome-divisions-in-christmas-address/7913720.html	2024-12-25T08:48:37-08:00	
NORAD's Santa tracker was Cold War morale boost. Now it attracts millions of kids	The Christmas tradition has become nearly global in scope: Children from around the world track Santa Claus as he sweeps across the earth, delivering presents and defying time. Each year, at least 100,000 kids call into the North American Aerospace Defense Command to inquire about Santa’s location. Millions more follow online in nine languages, from English to Japanese. On any other night, NORAD is scanning the heavens for potential threats, such as last year’s Chinese spy balloon. But on Christmas Eve, volunteers in Colorado Springs are fielding questions like, 'When is Santa coming to my house?' and, 'Am I on the naughty or nice list?' 'There are screams and giggles and laughter,' said Bob Sommers, 63, a civilian contractor and NORAD volunteer. Sommers often says on the call that everyone must be asleep before Santa arrives, prompting parents to say, 'Do you hear what he said? We got to go to bed early.' NORAD’s annual tracking of Santa has endured since the Cold War, predating ugly sweater parties and Mariah Carey classics. The tradition continues regardless of government shutdowns, such as the one in 2018, and this year. Here’s how it began and why the phones keep ringing. Origin story is Hollywood-esque It started with a child’s accidental phone call in 1955. The Colorado Springs newspaper printed a Sears advertisement that encouraged children to call Santa, listing a phone number. A boy called. But he reached the Continental Air Defense Command, now NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian effort to spot potential enemy attacks. Tensions were growing with the Soviet Union, along with anxieties about nuclear war. Air Force Col. Harry W. Shoup picked up an emergency-only 'red phone' and was greeted by a tiny voice that began to recite a Christmas wish list. 'He went on a little bit, and he takes a breath, then says, ‘Hey, you’re not Santa,’' Shoup told The Associated Press in 1999. Realizing an explanation would be lost on the youngster, Shoup summoned a deep, jolly voice and replied, 'Ho, ho, ho! Yes, I am Santa Claus. Have you been a good boy?' Shoup said he learned from the boy’s mother that Sears mistakenly printed the top-secret number. He hung up, but the phone soon rang again with a young girl reciting her Christmas list. Fifty calls a day followed, he said. In the pre-digital age, the agency used an 18-by-24-meter plexiglass map of North America to track unidentified objects. A staff member jokingly drew Santa and his sleigh over the North Pole. The tradition was born. 'Note to the kiddies,' began an AP story from Colorado Springs on Dec. 23, 1955. 'Santa Claus Friday was assured safe passage into the United States by the Continental Air Defense Command.' In a likely reference to the Soviets, the article noted that Santa was guarded against possible attack from 'those who do not believe in Christmas.' Is the origin story humbug? Some grinchy journalists have nitpicked Shoup’s story, questioning whether a misprint or a misdial prompted the boy’s call. In 2014, tech news site Gizmodo cited an International News Service story from December 1, 1955, about a child’s call to Shoup. Published in the Pasadena Independent, the article said the child reversed two digits in the Sears number. 'When a childish voice asked COC commander Col. Harry Shoup, if there was a Santa Claus at the North Pole, he answered much more roughly than he should — considering the season: ‘There may be a guy called Santa Claus at the North Pole, but he’s not the one I worry about coming from that direction,’' Shoup said in the brief piece. In 2015, The Atlantic magazine doubted the flood of calls to the secret line, while noting that Shoup had a flair for public relations. Phone calls aside, Shoup was indeed media savvy. In 1986, he told the Scripps Howard News Service that he recognized an opportunity when a staff member drew Santa on the glass map in 1955. A lieutenant colonel promised to have it erased. But Shoup said, 'You leave it right there,' and summoned public affairs. Shoup wanted to boost morale for the troops and public alike. 'Why, it made the military look good — like we’re not all a bunch of snobs who don’t care about Santa Claus,' he said. Shoup died in 2009. His children told the StoryCorps podcast in 2014 that it was a misprinted Sears ad that prompted the phone calls. 'And later in life he got letters from all over the world,' said Terri Van Keuren, a daughter. 'People saying, ‘Thank you, Colonel, for having, you know, this sense of humor.’' Rare addition to Santa’s story NORAD’s tradition is one of the few modern additions to the centuries-old Santa story that have endured, according to Gerry Bowler, a Canadian historian who spoke to the AP in 2010. Ad campaigns or movies try to 'kidnap' Santa for commercial purposes, said Bowler, who wrote 'Santa Claus: A Biography.' NORAD, by contrast, takes an essential element of Santa’s story and views it through a technological lens. In a recent interview with the AP, Air Force Lt. Gen. Case Cunningham explained that NORAD radars in Alaska and Canada — known as the northern warning system — are the first to detect Santa. He leaves the North Pole and typically heads for the international dateline in the Pacific Ocean. From there he moves west, following the night. 'That’s when the satellite systems we use to track and identify targets of interest every single day start to kick in,' Cunningham said. 'A probably little-known fact is that Rudolph’s nose that glows red emanates a lot of heat. And so those satellites track [Santa] through that heat source.' NORAD has an app and website, www.noradsanta.org, that will track Santa on Christmas Eve from 4 a.m. to midnight, mountain standard time. People can call 1-877-HI-NORAD to ask live operators about Santa’s location from 6 a.m. to midnight, mountain time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7913717.html	2024-12-25T08:43:13-08:00	
Russian cargo ship which sank off Spanish coast was victim of 'act of terrorism,' RIA cites owner	Moscow — A Russian cargo ship called Ursa Major that sank in the Mediterranean Sea was the victim of 'an act of terrorism,' state news agency RIA cited the vessel's owner as saying on Wednesday. The ship, built in 2009, sank after an explosion ripped through its engine room and two of its 16 crew were missing, the Russia's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. RIA cited Oboronlogistika, the ship's ultimate owner and a company that is part of the Russian Defense Ministry's military construction operations, as saying the vessel had been targeted in 'a terrorist act.' Oboronlogistika had previously said that the ship had been en route to the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok with two giant port cranes lashed to its deck.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-cargo-ship-which-sank-off-spanish-coast-was-victim-of-act-of-terrorism-ria-cites-owner-/7913703.html	2024-12-25T08:35:50-08:00	
King Charles thanks medics for his and Kate's cancer care	London — King Charles thanked the medics who have cared for him and his daughter-in-law Kate, after they both underwent treatment for cancer this year, in a Christmas Day message that touched on global conflicts and the summer's riots in Britain. In his third Christmas TV broadcast since becoming king, Charles struck an unusually personal tone for the royal seasonal message, a tradition that dates back to a radio speech by George V in 1932. The year has been traumatic for the royals after Buckingham Palace said in February the 76-year-old had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer detected in tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. A month later, Kate, the wife of his son and heir Prince William, said she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer that concluded in September. William has said the year has been brutal for the family. 'All of us go through some form of suffering at some stage in our life, be it mental or physical,' Charles, who became king in 2022 after the death of Queen Elizabeth, said. His words were accompanied by footage of a visit he made to a cancer treatment center on returning to public duties in April and of one of Kate's first engagements when she resumed working. 'From a personal point of view, I offer special heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses who this year have supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed,' Charles said. 'I am deeply grateful too to all those who have offered us their own kind words of sympathy and encouragement,' he said in the pre-recorded broadcast that was filmed at an ornate chapel of a former London hospital. Last week, a palace source said the king's treatment was progressing well and would continue into next year. Earlier on Wednesday, Charles was joined by his family, including Kate, William and their children, for a traditional church service on his Sandringham estate in eastern England. Charles' brother Prince Andrew, who was embroiled in another scandal this month when a close business associate was banned from Britain over government suspicions he was a Chinese agent, was a notable absentee from the royal get-together. Diversity a strength The king spoke about nationwide riots, which broke out following the murder in July of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed event in northern England, and mainly targeted mosques and immigrants. 'Diversity of culture, ethnicity and faith provide strength, not weakness', he said. 'I felt a deep sense of pride here in the United Kingdom when in response to anger and lawlessness in several towns this summer, communities came together not to repeat these behaviors, but to repair, to repair not just buildings, but relationships,' he said. Charles also referenced ongoing wars. 'On this Christmas Day, we cannot help but think of those for whom the devastating effects of conflict in the Middle East, in central Europe, in Africa and elsewhere, pose a daily threat to so many people's lives and livelihoods,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-charles-thanks-medics-for-his-and-kate-s-cancer-care-/7913696.html	2024-12-25T08:24:45-08:00	
Biden signs bill officially making the bald eagle the national bird of the US	Washington — The bald eagle, a symbol of the power and strength of the United States for more than 240 years, earned an overdue honor Tuesday: It officially became the country's national bird. President Joe Biden signed into law legislation sent to him by Congress that amends the United States Code to correct what had long gone unnoticed and designate the bald eagle — familiar to many because of its white head, yellow beak and brown body — as the national bird. The bald eagle has appeared on the Great Seal of the United States, which is used in official documents, since 1782, when the design was finalized. The seal is made up of the eagle, an olive branch, arrows, a flag-like shield, the motto 'E Pluribus Unum' and a constellation of stars. Congress, that same year, designated the bald eagle as the the national emblem, and its image appears in a host of places, ranging from documents and the presidential flag to military insignia and U.S. currency, according to USA.gov. But it had never been officially designated to be what many had just assumed it was — the national bird. The bald eagle is indigenous to North America.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-signs-a-bill-officially-making-the-bald-eagle-the-national-bird-of-the-us-/7913680.html	2024-12-25T08:13:31-08:00

Call for safety in Bangladesh Rohingya refugee camps after fatal fire	Kolkata, India — Sitting before a pile of dilapidated shacks and ashes in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, 80-year-old Rohingya refugee Amena Khatun began weeping as she talked about her 60-year-old son, Abul Hair. 'He was well and alive next to us, less than 24 hours ago,' she told VOA. 'And then, the fire broke out.' At least two people were killed and over 4,000 rendered homeless Tuesday by the sudden outbreak of a massive fire in the Rohingya refugee camp in Kutupalong. More than a million Rohingya people reside in bamboo-and-tarpaulin shacks across Cox’s Bazar, with several thousand others pouring in over the last few months, fleeing clashes in their native Myanmar between the government and the rebel Arakan Army. At around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, Khatun, alongside thousands of other Rohingya people in Kutupalong, first noticed the fire. 'My son had initially left our shelter with us when the fire started. But he went back to retrieve some important documents—and never made it out as he got stuck behind the intense flames,' said Khatun. 'Our lives are made to depend on the few documents we do possess as stateless refugees. But now, my son—a loving father of five—is gone along with the documents, all because of the sudden fire.' According to the Cox’s Bazar-based Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, or RRRC, of Bangladesh, the casualties include at least 19 Rohingya people, who were injured in the fire. The catastrophe also destroyed crucial infrastructure in the refugee camp like water tanks, tap stands, toilets and bath stalls. Mosques and offices of RRRC’s partner organizations were also damaged. Scant relief efforts RRRC Commissioner Mohammed Mizanur Rahman told VOA that the fire was brought under control by their officials, including the camp-in-charge, volunteers and the fire brigade. 'We had to demolish some shelters to prevent the fire from spreading. We, alongside the UNHCR and partner NGOs, have ensured that everyone left homeless has a temporary roof to sleep under, starting tonight,' he said. The U.N. World Food Program, WFP, will serve the fire survivors regular meals 'until they are fit to take care of themselves again,' Rahman said, adding that his team hopes to build them new shelters as soon as possible. While the cause of the fire has yet to be determined, fire service and civil defense senior official Tanharul Islam told reporters Tuesday that an investigation has been launched. However, survivors of the fire told VOA that as of Wednesday morning, they had not yet received any relief assistance. 'We have not received any help from the authorities or local NGOs yet,' said Khatun, the surviving parent of Abu Hair who lost his life yesterday. 'We don’t even know how the fire started.' A six-year-old boy, Burhanuddin, was the other camp resident killed in Tuesday’s fire. His father, 34-year-old Muzifur Rahman, echoed Khatun’s remark regarding assistance after the tragedy. 'In fact, our Rohingya refugee community in Cox’s Bazar has never been educated on any safety measures or protocols we are to follow to prevent or survive such fires,' he said. Recurring problem — across borders Bereaved father Rahman said that he is especially worried about his surviving family members because such fires are 'surprisingly common' in the Rohingya refugee camps. 'It makes me wonder if many of these fires are caused deliberately,' he said. Over 1,000 shelters were destroyed in a fire believed to have been started accidentally by a mud oven, mentioned by the UNHCR in their social media post, in the same camp in January of this year. In 2023, a fire that burned down the shelters of over 12,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar was described as a 'planned act of sabotage' by a senior government official, who said that the arson was carried out by militant groups. VOA had reported that the fire was started by feuding Rohingya gangs in the camps. On the other side of the border, in India, many Rohingya refugees living in camps face the same challenge. The Social and Political Research Foundation has reported that at least 12 'mysterious' fires broke out across Rohingya refugee camps in India between 2016 and 2021. Many of the incidents of arson are suspected to have been orchestrated by right-wing Hindu nationalist groups in the country. Responsibility for a 2018 fire in India that wrecked over 50 Rohingya refugee shelters was claimed by the youth wing of the ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. Mohammed Arfan, a senior member of the Wash, Sanitation and Hygiene project with Community Partners International in Bangladesh, said that Rohingya refugee families in Cox’s Bazar live in overcrowded and extremely cramped shelters made of highly flammable material, often cooking with gas cylinders in unsafe conditions. 'These families have survived a genocide and lost everything already. Now, they face yet another tragedy. They are not just statistics, but parents, children and grandparents who have lost their homes, memories and loved ones,' he said. 'This fire is a reminder that we need to do more, not just in the aftermath of these tragedies but to prevent them from happening at all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/call-for-safety-in-bangladesh-rohingya-refugee-camps-after-fatal-fire/7913606.html	2024-12-25T07:18:50-08:00	
American imprisoned in Russia sentenced to new 15-year jail term for espionage	Moscow — A Russian-born U.S. citizen already imprisoned in Russia on a bribery conviction has been handed a second 15-year jail term for espionage, Russian news agencies reported Tuesday. A Moscow court brought espionage charges against Gene Spector in August 2023. Details surrounding the case were not made public. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of the sentencing of a U.S. citizen in Russia and was monitoring the situation. Spector, formerly an executive at a medical equipment company in Russia, was previously sentenced to more than three years in prison in September 2022 for enabling bribes to an aide of former deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich. The aide, Anastasia Alekseyeva, was sentenced to 12 years in April for taking bribes of two expensive overseas vacation trips. Dvorkovich was a deputy prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev from 2012 to 2018. He is currently head of the international chess federation FIDE.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-imprisoned-in-russia-sentenced-to-new-15-year-jail-term-for-espionage/7913592.html	2024-12-25T06:47:18-08:00

Taliban allege Pakistani military strikes kill dozens in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials in Afghanistan reported Wednesday that at least 46 people were killed in an eastern border region because of an overnight aerial bombing that allegedly was conducted by Pakistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government spokesperson, stated that the attack on Tuesday evening targeted four locations in Barmal, a remote mountainous district in the Afghan border province of Paktika. 'The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,' Mujahid told the Agence France-Presse news agency, adding that six more civilians were wounded. The veracity of his claims regarding the purported casualties could not be ascertained from independent sources. While Pakistan has not commented on the allegations it had carried out the strikes, Pakistani security officials told reporters on condition of anonymity that the country carried out counterinsurgency precision airstrikes in Barmal. The officials, who were not authorized to interact with the media publicly, asserted that the military actions targeted multiple locations in the Afghan district that were associated with the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Islamabad maintains that the globally designated terrorist group orchestrates lethal attacks on Pakistani civilians and security personnel from its Afghan sanctuaries. The Afghan Ministry of National Defense condemned the strikes as 'barbaric' and a 'clear act of aggression' by Pakistan in violation of international laws. It asserted that both Afghan nationals and Pakistani refugee families residing in Barmal were the victims of the attack. 'The Islamic Emirate considers this brutal bombing a violation of international principles and a clear act of aggression,' said the Afghan Ministry of National Defense, using the official title of the Taliban government. 'This cowardly attack will not go unanswered,' the statement warned, without elaborating. The aerial attack came two days after heavily armed TTP militants stormed a security outpost in South Waziristan, a Pakistani district bordering Barmal, and killed 16 soldiers in one of the deadliest insurgent raids on Pakistan's military in recent months. Tuesday's strikes also came on a day when Taliban leaders hosted meetings with a high-level Pakistani delegation, marking the resumption of such interactions after a yearlong pause because of terrorism allegations. Taliban leaders have consistently denied allegations that Afghan territory is being used as a launching pad for attacks. The de facto Afghan government maintains it does not support the TTP or any other foreign militant group, describing the violence in Pakistan as an 'internal problem' for the neighboring country to resolve rather than blaming Kabul for the crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-allege-pakistani-military-strikes-kill-dozens-in-afghanistan/7913526.html	2024-12-25T05:49:19-08:00	
China, Japan foreign ministers meet and agree on visit, security dialog	BEIJING/TOKYO — Talks between China and Japan's foreign ministers in Beijing have paved way for Japan to host China's foreign affairs chief next year, and mutual agreement to hold a security dialog as soon as possible, Japan said on Wednesday. No details were given for when the events will take place but Japan's Takeshi Iwaya told reporters after his meeting and a working lunch with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that both agreed on continued high-level talks, including potentially an economic dialog during the 2025 visit. The one-day visit is Iwaya's first to the Chinese capital since becoming Japan's foreign minister in October, to discuss thorny issues with his country's largest trading partner. It follows an agreement between leaders of both countries to work towards a mutually beneficial strategic relationship. Ties between the neighbors -- trade partners with close economic and investment ties but rivals in security and territorial claims -- are complicated with long-standing geopolitical disagreements and historical wartime sensitivities. Iwaya raised several security concerns, urging China to take 'necessary action' including removing a buoy Japan had identified and believe was installed by China in the exclusive economic zone near one of Japan's southernmost islands. 'I also expressed my serious concerns about the situation in the East China Sea...and the increasing activity of the Chinese military,' he said. On regional concerns, Wang and Iwaya discussed North Korea. Iwaya sought for China to partake in 'a responsible role in maintaining peace and security in the international community,' he said. Japan has expressed 'grave concern' over North Korea's security alliance with Russia, in which North Korea stands to gain advanced military technology and combat experience. Wang stressed in the meeting that the significance of the countries' relationship went beyond bilateral ties. 'If China-Japan relations are stable, Asia will be more stable,' Wang said at the start of their meeting. Visa rules and seafood ban In reciprocity to China's eased visa rules, Japan will remove some requirements for three-year multiple entry tourist visas for Chinese citizens and allow those on group visas to stay up to 30 days, an increase from the previous 15. The country also has introduced a new 10-year multiple entry tourist visa. Last month, Beijing expanded its visa-free arrangements to include Japan until the end of 2025, restoring a policy that was suspended during the pandemic. China also extended the stay period to 30 days from 15. Japanese citizens were able to enter China without a visa for up to 14 days before COVID-19. Iwaya pointed out that addressing the safety and security of Japanese nationals was important to increase travel between Japan and China. Cases of Japanese nationals detained under China's anti-espionage law and the lack of transparency around the law have led to Japanese people feeling hesitant about traveling to China, Iwaya said, calling for more transparency and the release of those detained. Their discussion of China's ban on Japanese seafood, highly expected on the agenda, did not indicate any easing on restrictions, but only that both sides agreed to 'properly implement' a recent agreement. A major sticking point in bilateral ties has been Japan's discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant that Beijing strongly opposed and responded to by tightening inspections on Japanese goods. China was Japan's largest export market for aquatic products until Beijing fully banned them in protest against Tokyo's actions. Both governments reached an agreement in September that obligates Japan to set up a long-term international monitoring arrangement allowing stakeholders such as China to conduct independent sampling of the treated water. That was expected to restart the imports but China still wants reassurances from Tokyo that it would fulfill its commitment before 'adjusting relevant measures' and gradually restore imports that meet standards and regulations. However, both countries were ready to restart talks on resuming Japanese beef and rice imports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-japan-foreign-ministers-meet-and-agree-on-visit-security-dialog/7913478.html	2024-12-25T04:55:49-08:00	
Bosnia's Serb MPs move to block state institutions, EU integration	SARAJEVO — Lawmakers in Bosnia's Serb Republic regional parliament on Wednesday ordered Serb representatives in state institutions to block decision-making and reform laws needed for the Balkan country's integration into the European Union. An emergency session of parliament was called on Tuesday evening to discuss a 'degradation of a legal system' in relation to the ongoing trial of the region's president Milorad Dodik at Bosnia's state court. Dodik, a Serb separatist leader, is being tried for defying decisions by the international High Representative which oversees peace in the country under the 1995 Dayton Accords which ended 3-1/2 years of ethnic war. The MPs said the trial was 'politically mounted,' based on the 'illegal decisions' of current envoy Christian Schmidt and of the state court and prosecution which they regard as unconstitutional because they were set up by the peace envoy and not by the Dayton treaty. Pro-Russian Dodik has tried hard to separate his Serb-dominated region from Bosnia in recent years but halted the process after the start of the war in Ukraine. Under the Dayton treaty, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and a Federation dominated by Croats and Bosniaks linked via a weak central government. That secured peace but left Bosnia dysfunctional as a state. After years of political obstructions to joining the EU, Bosnia received a boost last year when EU leaders agreed to open negotiations once it had reached the necessary compliance with membership criteria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnia-s-serb-mps-move-to-block-state-institutions-eu-integration/7913446.html	2024-12-25T03:57:14-08:00	
Houthis claim missile attack targeting central Israel	The Yemen-based Houthi militant group said Wednesday it fired a ballistic missile at the Tel Aviv area in central Israel, an attack that prompted air raid sirens to sound but caused no damage. Israel’s military said it intercepted the missile before it crossed into Israeli territory. The missile was the second in the span of two days launched by the Houthis and the latest in a campaign they say is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In addition to launching missiles at Israel, the Houthis have also disrupted the key shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with attacks against ships. Israeli officials have become more direct in their rhetoric toward the Houthis in recent days, pledging to take action against the Iran-backed group. Hostage deaths The presence of Israeli troops inadvertently contributed to the deaths in August of six hostages held in Gaza, according to the results of an investigation by the Israeli military released Tuesday. The six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were taken by Hamas militants during the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel. They were killed by Hamas after nearly 330 days in captivity. The military's report found that 'ground activities in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision' to kill the six hostages. Their bodies were found 48 to 72 hours later in a tunnel in late August, the report said. The military was operating in that area of southern Gaza because the likelihood that hostages were there was considered medium to low, the report said. 'The investigation published tonight proves once again that the return of all hostages will only be possible through a deal,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Tuesday. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,300 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-claim-missile-attack-targeting-central-israel/7913392.html	2024-12-25T02:19:57-08:00	
Passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashes in Kazakhstan with many feared dead	ASTANA — An Embraer passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday with 62 passengers and five crew on board, Kazakh authorities announced, saying that 27 people had survived. Unverified video of the crash showed the plane, which was operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, bursting into flames as it hit the ground and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact. The Central Asian country's emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including three children, were being treated at a nearby hospital. Azerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 aircraft, with flight number J2-8243, had been flying from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Russia's Chechnya, but had been forced to make an emergency landing approximately 3 km from the Kazakh city of Aktau. Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny. Authorities in Kazakhstan said they had begun looking into different possible versions of what had happened, including a technical problem, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Russia's aviation watchdog said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. Following the crash, Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, was returning home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, Russia's RIA news agency reported. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/passenger-plane-flying-from-azerbaijan-to-russia-crashes-in-kazakhstan-with-many-feared-dead/7913375.html	2024-12-25T01:15:42-08:00	
India Faces Diplomatic Challenge as Bangladesh Calls for Hasina’s Extradition	NEW DELHI — A formal request by Bangladesh to India to extradite former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after she was ousted by mass student-led protests, poses a diplomatic conundrum for New Delhi, say analysts. Since Hasina’s exit, who was New Delhi’s close ally during her 15-year rule of neighboring Bangladesh, India has been trying to build ties with the new administration that has requested her return to 'face a judicial process.' Confirming that it has received a diplomatic note for her extradition, India’s foreign ministry said on Monday that 'we have no comment to offer on this matter.' Political analysts say relations with Dhaka, which are already fraught, are likely to be further strained over the extradition request. 'This places Delhi in an uncomfortable position and will undermine ties with the interim government because India simply cannot accede to this request,' said Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'She has sought political sanctuary here.' The extradition request for Hasina came two months after the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrants for the country’s former prime minister. She was summoned to appear to face charges of 'crimes against humanity' that took place during demonstrations in which hundreds were killed. However, analysts say there is no likelihood of India acceding to the extradition request. Both countries have an extradition treaty, but it allows for requests to be refused if the offense is of 'political nature.' 'There are no circumstances under which I can envision New Delhi granting this request,’’ said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute, Wilson Center, in Washington. ‘’Hasina has arguably been India's closest friend in the neighborhood, and for a long time. New Delhi isn't about to turn on her. It will likely try to invoke one of the clauses in the extradition treaty to justify not turning her over to Dhaka.' The formal request to New Delhi comes two weeks after talks between India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, and the interim government in Dhaka raised hopes that ties between the South Asian neighbors would stabilize. It was the first high-level diplomatic meeting between the two countries since Hasina’s exit stressed relations. India has complained about what it said were attacks on minority Hindus in the Muslim-majority country in recent months. Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, who met Misri, said the reports were exaggerated and asked India to help clear the 'clouds' that have cast a shadow over the relationship in recent times. Both countries said they were keen to pursue constructive relations. The extradition request, however, will be seen as a dampener on efforts to bring the relationship back on an even keel. 'The Bangladesh government is putting pressure on India, saying that if you want friendly ties, then repatriate her,' said analyst Joshi. India’s strong backing for Hasina during her 15-year rule was seen by many in Bangladesh as having contributed to the erosion of democracy in the country and had deepened anger against India, according to analysts in Dhaka. Hasina was perceived as an authoritarian ruler who had clamped down on dissent. 'In Bangladesh, there is widespread support to bring Hasina back to face trial. If India does not repatriate her, which it is unlikely to do, this will deepen anti-India sentiment in the country,' according to Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, a researcher with the Bangladesh Peace Observatory in Dhaka. Hasina’s presence in India has made it challenging for Delhi to develop friendly ties with the new interim government in Dhaka. For India, a strong relationship with Bangladesh is important to ensure stability along their 4096-kilometer-long border in a neighborhood where it already confronts Pakistan and China along hostile borders. It is also important for the security of its northeastern states that share a border with Bangladesh. Trade has grown and both countries have built connectivity projects to boost economic ties. 'India will soft pedal the extradition issue for the time being,’’ said Tara Kartha, director of research and analysis at the Center for Land Warfare Studies in New Delhi. ‘’Hopefully, once an elected government comes, they will moderate their stand, over a period of time. There is an anti-India feeling, but you will certainly not give a signal to the entire neighborhood that you will not stand by a former ally.' Yunus has said Bangladesh's next elections will be held in late 2025 or early 2026. While the issue will be an irritant over the coming months, analysts say in the long run, both countries will smoothen ties. 'India likely knew Bangladesh would make the (extradition) request, and I'm sure Dhaka assumes New Delhi will say no,' said Kugelman, who said that while the relationship is in a 'bad place,’’ the issue is 'something that they can work around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-faces-diplomatic-challenge-as-bangladesh-calls-for-hasina-s-extradition/7913341.html	2024-12-24T23:35:02-08:00	
Sweeping Vietnam internet law comes into force	BANGKOK — New Vietnamese internet rules requiring Facebook and TikTok to verify user identities and hand over data to authorities came into force on Wednesday, in what critics say is the latest attack on freedom of expression in the Southeast Asian nation. Under 'Decree 147,' all tech giants operating in Vietnam are required to verify users' accounts via their phone numbers or Vietnamese identification numbers, and store that information alongside their full name and date of birth. They must provide that data to authorities on request and remove any content the government regards as 'illegal' within 24 hours. The new rules came into force on Wednesday, state media VNExpress said. All social media sites had been given 90 days to provide data on 'the total number of regular visits from Vietnam' and the number of regular users per month to authorities, the website said. 'Decree 147 will be used to publicly suppress those with different viewpoints,' said activist Dang Thi Hue, who writes about politics and social issues on her Facebook account, which has 28,000 followers. The decree was 'the latest sign of infringement of basic freedoms... with a vague line between what is legal and what is not,' said former political prisoner Le Anh Hung. 'No one wants to go to jail. So, of course, some activists will be more cautious and afraid of this decree.' Vietnam's hardline administration generally moves swiftly to stamp out dissent and arrest critics, especially those who find an audience on social media. In October, blogger Duong Van Thai -- who had almost 120,000 followers on YouTube, where he regularly recorded livestreams critical of the government -- was jailed for 12 years on charges of publishing anti-state information. Decree 147 builds on a 2018 cybersecurity law that was sharply criticized by the United States, European Union and internet freedom advocates who said it mimics China's repressive censorship of the internet. 'Just keep playing' The decree also says that only verified accounts can livestream, impacting the exploding number of people earning a living through social commerce on sites such as TikTok. Aside from the ramifications for social media firms, the new laws also include curbs on gaming for under-18s, designed to prevent addiction. Game publishers are expected to enforce a time limit of an hour per game session and not more than 180 minutes a day for all games. Just over half of Vietnam's 100 million population regularly plays such games, says data research firm Newzoo. A large proportion of the population is also on social media, with the Ministry of Information and Communications estimating the country has around 65 million Facebook users, 60 million on YouTube and 20 million on TikTok. The force of the decree was yet to be felt Wednesday at a small online gaming cafe in capital Hanoi, where around a dozen young people were glued to their desktop screens. 'I don't know anything about a time limit for the games,' said one 15-year-old boy who said he had skipped class to come and play. 'I just keep playing, and as you see, it still works.' 'I never have to show an ID or student card to enter a gameshop or for my game account online. I don't know how (the decree) will work. Let's see.' The owner of the cafe, who charges around 30 cents for an hour of gaming, was similarly nonchalant. 'I have no idea what this decree is about. I don't know if it will work or not.' 'My business is still going normally. They pay and we let them use the desktop for their gaming. It's simple.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweeping-vietnam-internet-law-comes-into-force/7913333.html	2024-12-24T22:38:47-08:00	
Prosecutors find workers in 'slavery like' conditions at Chinese car company site in Brazil	RIO DE JANEIRO — A task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in 'slavery-like' conditions at a construction site in northeastern Brazil, where Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is building a factory. On Tuesday, the Labor Prosecutor’s Office released videos of the dorms where the construction workers were staying, which showed beds with no mattresses and rooms without any places for the workers to store their personal belongings. In a statement issued Monday, the prosecutor’s office said the workers had been hired in China by Jinjiang Construction Brazil, one of the contractors on the site, which is located in Camaçari, a city in the Salvador metropolitan region. Officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated the workers' passports and held 60% of their wages. Those who quit would be forced to pay the company for their airfare from China, and for their return ticket, the statement said. Efforts to reach Jinjiang Construction in Brazil were unsuccessful as a contact phone number and email address were not immediately available. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world’s largest producers of electric cars. The company said on Monday night that it will 'immediately terminate the contract' with the Jinjian group and is 'studying other appropriate measures.' BYD said that the Jinjiang workers will be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and that they will not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been revising working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that 'adjustments' had to be made. Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD’s site in Camaçari was especially critical, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up and get ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m. Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker’s freedom of movement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-find-workers-in-slavery-like-conditions-at-chinese-car-company-site-in-brazil/7913328.html	2024-12-24T22:12:59-08:00	
Ukraine reports ‘massive’ Russian missile attack on Kharkiv	Officials in northeastern Ukraine reported a 'massive missile attack' Wednesday on the city of Kharkiv that injured at least three people. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram there was a series of explosions in the city. Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor, said the attack damaged civilian infrastructure. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday its air defenses destroyed 58 Ukrainian aerial drones, a number that is higher than typical in the daily exchange of drone attacks between the two sides. The ministry said 26 of the intercepts took place over the Belgorod region and 23 over Voronezh, with other drones being shot down over Kursk, Bryansk, Tambov and the Sea of Azov. Voronezh Governor Aleksandr Gusev said on Telegram that the Ukrainian attacks damaged several houses and a power line.

China to focus on stabilizing housing market in 2025, housing regulator says	BEIJING — Efforts will continue in 2025 to stabilize and prevent further declines in China's real estate market, China Construction News reported, citing a work conference held by the housing regulator on Tuesday and Wednesday. China will vigorously promote the reform of the commercial housing sales system, and expand the scope of urban village renovation beyond the addition of one million units, the report said. China will strictly control the supply of commercial housing, while increasing the supply of affordable housing to help solve the living problems of a large number of new citizens, young people and migrant workers, it said. Policymakers have stepped up efforts to revive the real estate market by introducing new measures to encourage home demand after a government-led campaign to rein in highly leveraged developers, triggered a crisis in 2021. Since September, measures aimed at encouraging homebuying have included cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payments, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions. The real estate market has shown some momentum of stabilizing, with home transactions in October and November seeing year-on-year and month-on-month growth for two consecutive months, said the conference. China's home prices fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November, supported by government efforts to revive the sector, official data showed. An official of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission in December called for policy measures with direct impact on stabilizing the real estate market to be adopted as soon as possible, with local governments getting greater autonomy to buy housing stock.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-focus-on-stabilizing-housing-market-in-2025-housing-regulator-says/7913316.html	2024-12-24T20:57:09-08:00	
Ecuadorian police investigate if bodies are those of missing children allegedly taken by soldiers	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian police on Tuesday found an undisclosed number of bodies in an area close to a military base, officials said, and were investigating whether the bodies could be of some of the four children who were last seen taken by men in military uniform earlier this month. The case of the children, aged 11 to 15, who went missing on December 8, has profoundly shaken Ecuador, with rights groups and the public demanding information about their whereabouts and asking that the case be investigated as a forced disappearance. Under pressure for answers, authorities said 16 soldiers had been placed in custody and were being investigated in the disappearance of the minors. Also Tuesday, prosecutors said they are looking to charge some members of the military with forced disappearance in the case. They did not provide further details, and no charges have yet been raised. According to a police official who spoke with The Associated Press, the bodies discovered Tuesday were found in a mangrove area near the western city of Taura, where the military base is located. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the case, did not say how many bodies were found but added that they are now being analyzed to determine whether they were the children. Two other officials following the case, who also asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, told the AP that the bodies were charred and showed signs of violence. President Daniel Noboa, whose government has used the military to fight soaring crime as part of a security strategy with which he seeks to be reelected in February, has promised that his administration would not cover up for anyone in the disappearance. The children went missing in the coastal city of Guayaquil, where dozens of people demonstrated on Monday demanding accountability and answers. Defense Minister Gian Carlo Loffredo on Tuesday ordered the army to keep 16 soldiers in custody pending investigation, according to a statement posted on X. The bodies were found near the Taura Military Base, on the outskirts of Guayaquil, where the Ecuadorian Air Force is headquartered, according to the police official. The 16 troops in custody were assigned to that base. Surveillance videos emerged this week showing men in military uniform grabbing two boys and driving off with them. The two are believed to be among four children who disappeared that night. Loffredo on Monday confirmed the four were detained in the area where the footage was taken. The videos, seen by the AP, show a group of children running, men in uniform, two children being placed in the back of a pickup truck and the vehicle moving through the streets of Guayaquil. The footage appears to back up the account of Luis Arroyo, the father of two of the missing children. Arroyo earlier told local media that his children were on their way home after playing soccer when two vehicles carrying people in military uniforms arrived in the area. The children, he said, were chased and four were caught and driven away. It wasn't clear how he knew this. Loffredo, the defense minister, told reporters on Monday that, according to a military report, the children were detained by a patrol with 16 agents who 'observed eight people who were allegedly robbing a woman.' He said the military later released the minors and did not hand them over to the police. The footage reviewed by the AP does not show the alleged robbery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuadorian-police-investigate-if-bodies-are-those-of-missing-children-allegedly-taken-by-soldiers-/7913294.html	2024-12-24T18:59:20-08:00	
Legendary Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal dies at age 90	NEW DELHI — Shyam Benegal, a renowned Indian filmmaker known for pioneering a cinema movement that tackled social issues in the 1970s, has died after chronic kidney disease. He was 90. His contribution to cinema was recognized as a director, editor and screenwriter. He came into the limelight with films — Ankur (1974), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976) and Bhumika (1977) — that challenged mainstream Bollywood by dealing with the social realities of a poor nation. Benegal died Monday at Mumbai's Wockhardt Hospital, and his cremation will take place on Tuesday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, citing his daughter Piya. 'Benegal had been suffering from chronic kidney disease for several years but it had gotten very bad,' Piya said. Many paid tribute to the filmmaker on social media platform X. Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt wrote that Benegal told stories without pretense. 'They were raw and real, about the struggles of ordinary people. His films had craft and conviction.' 'Deeply saddened by the passing of Shyam Benegal, whose storytelling had a profound impact on Indian cinema. His works will continue to be admired by people from different walks of life,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted. Benegal was a mentor to top Indian actors including Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri, who made their mark in Bollywood's popular cinema as well. 'I have lost my foster father, a man to whom I owe more than I can say,' Shah posted. 'Shyam Benegal was not just a legend; he was a visionary who redefined storytelling and inspired generations,' said actor Manoj Bajpayee. The film Ankur explored the feudal divide in India, while Manthan was based on the story of the country's cooperative dairy milk movement. Benegal also was widely known for Bharat Ek Khoj, a landmark 53-episode television series based on the book Discovery of India, written by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It chronicled the country's troubled passages, from ancient times to modernity. He also directed a 2023 biopic on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh's freedom struggle against Pakistan in the 1970s. Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August following a student movement, is the daughter of Rahman. Benegal was born in 1934 in Hyderabad in southern India. He earned an economics degree from Hyderabad's Osmania University and established the Hyderabad Film Society. He also ventured into advertising, where he directed over 900 sponsored documentaries and advertising films. Benegal also is survived by his wife, Nira Benegal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7913285.html	2024-12-24T17:54:13-08:00

France has new government, again. Politics and crushing debt complicate next steps	Paris — France's president and prime minister managed to form a new government just in time for the holidays. Now comes the hard part. Crushing debt, intensifying pressure from the nationalist far right, wars in Europe and the Mideast — challenges abound for President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Francois Bayrou after an already tumultuous 2024. The most urgent order of business is passing a 2025 budget. Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to bring down its deficit, to comply with European Union rules limiting debt and keep France's borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the stability and prosperity of all countries that share the euro currency. France's debt is currently estimated at a staggering 112% of gross domestic product. It grew further after the government gave aid payments to businesses and workers during COVID-19 lockdowns even as the pandemic depressed growth, and capped household energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. The bill is now coming due. But France's previous government collapsed this month because Marine Le Pen's far-right party and left-wing lawmakers opposed $62.4 billion (60 billion euros) in spending cuts and tax hikes in the original 2025 budget plan. Bayrou and new Finance Minister Eric Lombard are expected to scale back some of those promises, but the calculations are tough. 'The political situation is difficult. The international situation is dangerous, and the economic context is fragile,' Lombard, a low-profile banker who advised a Socialist government in the 1990s, said upon taking office. 'The environmental emergency, the social emergency, developing our businesses — these innumerable challenges require us to treat our endemic illness: the deficit,' he said. 'The more we are indebted, the more the debt costs, and the more it suffocates the country.' This is France's fourth government in the past year. No party has a parliamentary majority, and the new Cabinet can only survive with the support of lawmakers on the center-right and center-left. Le Pen — Macron's fiercest rival — was instrumental in ousting the previous government by joining left-wing forces in a no-confidence vote. Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government and Le Pen remains a powerful force. That angers left-wing groups, who had expected more influence in the new Cabinet, and who say promised spending cuts will hurt working-class families and small businesses hardest. Left-wing voters, meanwhile, feel betrayed ever since a coalition from the left won the most seats in the summer's snap legislative elections but failed to secure a government. The possibility of a new no-confidence vote looms, though it's not clear how many parties would support it. Macron has repeatedly said he will remain president until his term expires in 2027. But France's constitution and current structure, dating from 1958 and called the Fifth Republic, were designed to ensure stability after a period of turmoil. If this new government collapses within months and the country remains in political paralysis, pressure will mount for Macron to step down and call early elections. Le Pen's ascendant National Rally is intent on bringing Macron down. But Le Pen faces her own headaches: A March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office. The National Rally and hard-right Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau want tougher immigration rules. But Bayrou wants to focus on making existing rules work. 'There are plenty of [immigration] laws that exist. None is being applied,' he said Monday on broadcaster BFM-TV, to criticism from conservatives. Military spending is a key issue amid fears about European security and pressure from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Europe to spend more on its own defense. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, who champions military aid for Ukraine and ramping up weapons production, kept his job and stressed in a statement Tuesday the need to face down ''accumulating threats'' against France. More immediately, Macron wants an emergency law in early January to allow sped-up reconstruction of the cyclone-ravaged French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean off Africa. Thousands of people are in emergency shelters, and authorities are still counting the dead more than a week after the devastation. Meanwhile, the government in the restive French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia collapsed Tuesday in a wave of resignations by pro-independence figures — another challenge for the new overseas affairs minister, Manuel Valls, and the incoming Cabinet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-has-new-government-again-politics-and-crushing-debt-complicate-next-steps/7913279.html	2024-12-24T17:24:53-08:00

NASA probe makes closest-ever pass by the sun	WASHINGTON — NASA's pioneering Parker Solar Probe made history Tuesday, flying closer to the sun than any other spacecraft, with its heat shield exposed to scorching temperatures topping 930 degrees Celsius (1,700 degrees Fahrenheit). Launched in August 2018, the spaceship is on a seven-year mission to deepen scientific understanding of our star and help forecast space-weather events that can affect life on Earth. Tuesday's historic flyby should have occurred at precisely 11:53 Greenwich Mean Time, although mission scientists will have to wait until Friday for confirmation as they lose contact with the craft for several days due to its proximity to the sun. 'Right now, Parker Solar Probe is flying closer to a star than anything has ever been before,' at 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) away, NASA official Nicky Fox said in a video on social media Tuesday morning. 'It is just a total 'yay, we did it,' moment.' If the distance between Earth and the sun is the equivalent to the length of an American football field, 109.7 meters, the spacecraft should have been about four meters from the end zone at the moment of closest approach — known as perihelion. 'This is one example of NASA's bold missions, doing something that no one else has ever done before to answer long-standing questions about our universe,' Parker Solar Probe program scientist Arik Posner said in a statement on Monday. 'We can't wait to receive that first status update from the spacecraft and start receiving the science data in the coming weeks.' So effective is the heat shield that the probe's internal instruments remain near room temperature — around 29 C (85 F) — as it explores the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona. Parker will also be moving at a blistering pace of around 690,000 kilometers per hour (430,000 miles per hourph), fast enough to fly from the U.S. capital, Washington, to Japan's Tokyo in under a minute. 'Parker will truly be returning data from uncharted territory,' said Nick Pinkine, mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. 'We're excited to hear back from the spacecraft when it swings back around the sun.' By venturing into these extreme conditions, Parker has been helping scientists tackle some of the sun's biggest mysteries: how solar wind originates, why the corona is hotter than the surface below, and how coronal mass ejections — massive clouds of plasma that hurl through space are formed. The Christmas Eve flyby is the first of three record-setting close passes, with the next two — on March 22 and June 19, 2025 — both expected to bring the probe back to a similarly close distance from the Sun.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-probe-makes-closest-ever-pass-by-the-sun/7913023.html	2024-12-24T16:25:18-08:00	
Kurdish-led forces push back Turkish-backed Syrian rebels	QAMISHLI, SYRIA — The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Tuesday they have launched a counteroffensive against the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army to take back areas near Syria's northern border with Turkey. The SDF is Washington's critical ally in Syria, targeting sleeper cells of the extremist Islamic State group scattered across the country's east. Since the fall of the totalitarian rule of Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, clashes have intensified between the U.S.-backed group and the SNA, which captured the key city of Manbij and the areas surrounding it. The intense weekslong clashes come at a time when Syria, battered by over a decade of war and economic misery, negotiates its political future following half a century under the Assad dynasty's rule. Ruken Jamal, spokesperson of the Women's Protection Unit under the SDF, told The Associated Press that their fighters are just over seven miles (11 kilometers) away from the center of Manbij in their ongoing counteroffensive. She accused Ankara of trying to weaken the group's influence in negotiations over Syria's political future through the SNA. 'Syria is now in a new phase, and discussions are underway about the future of the country,' Jamal said. 'Turkey is trying, through its attacks, to distract us with battles and exclude us from the negotiations in Damascus.' A Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says since the SNA's offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds started earlier this month, dozens from both sides have been killed. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke on Tuesday with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, according to Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder. He said they discussed the ongoing situation in Syria, and Austin emphasized that close and continuous coordination is crucial to a successful effort to counter IS in the country. They also discussed the importance of setting the conditions to enable a more secure and stable Syria. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large border. While the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — that toppled Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria's second key actor for its political future. On Monday, the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said the group's forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij. The British-based war monitor said on Tuesday that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam. Turkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days. During Syria's uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him. Even with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara's position won't change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa of HTS. 'It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,' Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. 'The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides [against IS].' With the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong IS resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremist group's scattered sleeper cells. Tens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of IS militants are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kurdish-led-forces-push-back-turkish-backed-syrian-rebels/7913011.html	2024-12-24T15:53:35-08:00

Armed men fire on Haiti hospital reopening, killing at least 2	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — At least two people were killed and others injured on Tuesday when armed men opened fire on a group of journalists who gathered for a government press conference set to announce the reopening of Haiti's largest public hospital, a witness to the attack told Reuters. A reporter and a police officer were killed, said a journalist at the scene who asked not to be named. Haiti's national police did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for information. The attack comes as armed gangs gain territory in Haiti in the face of under-resourced security forces and little international response and follows several mass killings in the capital and surrounding rural areas. Haiti's transitional presidential council said in a post on Facebook that the act would not go without consequences. 'We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particular, to the Haitian National Police and all the journalists' associations,' it said, without confirming the number of people killed. Journalists were invited to arrive at the hospital in the downtown area of the capital Port-au-Prince from 8 a.m. for the press conference with Haiti's new health minister. They were still awaiting the minister when shooting began about 11 a.m. Health Minister Duckenson Lorthe Blema was installed in November in a Cabinet reshuffle when former Prime Minister Garry Conille was ousted after just six months in office. The State University of Haiti Hospital, known locally as the General Hospital, is the country's largest public hospital, but it has been closed since a March surge in gang attacks that saw former Prime Minister Ariel Henry ousted from power. In July, authorities celebrated retaking control of the hospital with a press conference in the facility, but Conille was forced to flee alongside security officers and journalists under a flurry of gunfire. The hospital is a stone's throw from the central Champ de Mars square, an area that has seen frequent gun battles and clashes between police and a citywide alliance of gangs known as Viv Ansanm. Gangs are estimated to control 80% to 90% of the capital, while neighboring countries have been slow to deliver on promises of security support for the Caribbean nation. An international mission approved last year has so far seen just a fraction of troops deploying, while Haitian calls to shore up its resources by converting it to a peacekeeping force met opposition at the United Nations Security Council. A spokesperson for the mission, led by Kenya, told Reuters after shooting began that its personnel had not been invited to the conference, and it had sent in reinforcements. Only 24% of health facilities in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area are currently operating, according to a recent U.N. report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-men-fire-on-haiti-hospital-reopening-killing-at-least-2-/7912982.html	2024-12-24T14:35:56-08:00	
Searchers believe US journalist Tice still alive	The nonprofit group Hostage Aid Worldwide, one of the teams looking for U.S. journalist Austin Tice in Syria, said Tuesday it believes he is still alive. 'We have data that Austin is alive till January 2024, but the president of the U.S. said in August that he is alive, and we are sure that he is alive today,' said Nizar Zakka, president of Hostage Aid Worldwide, according to Agence France-Presse. 'We are trying to be as transparent as possible and to share as much information as possible,' he told a news conference Tuesday in Damascus but did not offer information on where Tice might be. Earlier this week, Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy, said a network of secret prisons run by the former Syrian government is more extensive than the U.S. had realized and is complicating efforts to find Tice. The U.S. government initially estimated Syria had about 10 to 20 secret prisons, but there may be 40 or more, Carstens told reporters Friday following a brief trip to Damascus, the Syrian capital. 'I've been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said. 'They're in little clusters at times. Sometimes they're in the far reaches of Damascus.' The scale of the prison network has made it hard to locate Tice, according to Carstens. Not seen since 2012 Tice, 43, was working for Agence France-Presse, McClatchy News, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets in Syria. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him. Over the past 12 years, the U.S. government has pinpointed about six prisons where Tice was believed to have likely been, Carstens said. But new information means as many as three more facilities have been added to the list. Limited resources make checking them a difficult endeavor, Carstens said. In the absence of sufficient U.S. government personnel on the ground, nongovernmental organizations, journalists and Syria's transitional government have been searching for Tice. 'In a perfect world, we'll find Austin and bring him home, and we'll stop the search,' Carstens said. 'We're not going to stop until we find the information we need to conclude what has happened to Austin, where he is, to return him home to his family.' Assad's ouster raises hope In the aftermath of the Assad government's collapse this month, thousands of prisoners have been released from facilities run by the government. That has raised hopes among the Tice family that Austin will be among them. 'I feel like we're standing in line, and we're not the only ones that are still standing in line,' Tice's mother, Debra Tice, told reporters on Monday. 'We just need to get all those prisons opened, get all those families reunited, including us.' Tice is the longest-held American journalist abroad. Shortly before the Assad government fell, the Tice family revealed that it had received information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirmed Austin was alive and held in the Damascus area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/searchers-believe-us-journalist-tice-still-alive/7912966.html	2024-12-24T14:09:50-08:00	
Medellin cartel victims demand justice as boss Ochoa walks free in Colombia	BOGOTA, Colombia — The return of former drug trafficker Fabio Ochoa to Colombia following his deportation from the United States has reopened old wounds among victims of the Medellín cartel, with some expressing dismay at the Colombian authorities' decision to let Ochoa walk free. Some of the cartel victims said Tuesday they are hoping the former drug lord will at least cooperate with ongoing efforts by human rights groups to investigate one of the most violent periods of Colombia's history and demanded that Colombian prosecutors take Ochoa in for questioning. In the late '80s and early '90s the Medellín cartel killed police officers, politicians, judges, journalists and bystanders as it waged war on the Colombian state, which had stepped up its efforts to cut off drug shipments, arrest drug traffickers and seize their properties. Some historians in Colombia attribute 10,000 killings to cartel leader Pablo Escobar. Ochoa was one of the cartel's key operators at the time and lived for several years in Miami where he ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel. He has denied being involved in the cartel killings. But many victims of the cartel and their relatives are highly skeptical of that claim. Bogotá Mayor Carlos Fernando Galán was 12 when his father, presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán was killed by cartel hitmen in 1989. On Monday night Galán wrote in a message on X that it was 'unacceptable' for Ochoa not to be facing any charges in Colombia. Galán's older brother, Juan Manuel Galán, went further. 'The majority of the [Medellín cartel's] crimes are in impunity' he wrote on X. 'Along with thousands of victims we hope to know the truth about Ochoa's responsibility and that of his allies in kidnappings, murders and indiscriminate acts of terrorism.' Ochoa was deported to Colombia on Monday after serving more than 20 years in prison in the U.S. for a drug trafficking conviction, which was not related to any killings in Colombia. The 67-year-old had his fingerprints taken at the airport and was let go by immigration officials who ran his name through a database and confirmed he is not wanted by Colombian authorities. Speaking to journalists, who frantically swarmed around him in Bogotá's airport, Ochoa claimed he had been 'framed' by U.S. prosecutors. He added that he had paid for his drug trafficking crimes in Colombia in the early 1990s, when he spent several years in a Colombian prison. Ochoa was released in 1996 but was once again arrested in 1999 and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 others as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy. Gonzalo Enrique Rojas was a young boy in 1989 when his father died on a commercial plane that was blown up by the Medellín cartel, killing all 107 people on board. Rojas, who now leads a foundation for victims of Colombia's conflict said that Ochoa's return to Colombia presents an opportunity for more details to be known about that incident, such as what motivated the cartel to attack a plane full of civilians, and what were its relations with members of the Colombian government. He said that Colombian prosecutors should interrogate Ochoa about this event and other crimes committed by the cartel. He added that his foundation, Colombia with Memory, will also try to seek a meeting with the former cartel boss. 'The years in prison [for cartel leaders] are not that relevant for those of us who are victims of the Medellín cartel,' Rojas said. 'What really repairs the pain is justice and truth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/medellin-cartel-victims-demand-justice-as-boss-ochoa-walks-free-in-colombia/7912971.html	2024-12-24T13:54:26-08:00	
Pope Francis kicks off year-long Jubilee that will test his stamina, Rome's patience	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis kicked off the 2025 Holy Year on Tuesday, inaugurating a celebration of the Catholic Church that is expected to draw some 32 million pilgrims to Rome in a test of the pope's stamina and the ability of the Eternal City to welcome them. From his wheelchair, Francis knocked a few times, and the great Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica swung open. He was wheeled across the threshold as bells tolled across Rome and the choir inside the basilica began Christmas Eve Mass. In his homily, Francis said the Holy Year is an opportunity to relieve the debt of poor countries and commit to protecting the planet. The aim of the Jubilee, he said, is 'to bring hope to the interminable, dreary days of prisoners, to the cold and dismal lodgings of the poor and to all those places desecrated by war and violence.' The ceremony inaugurated the once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome. Francis has dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to the theme of hope, and he will underscore that message when he opens a Holy Door on Thursday at Rome’s Rebibbia Prison in a bid to give inmates hope for a better future. Francis has long incorporated prison ministry into his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia and other prisons during his travels. Security around the Vatican was at its highest levels following the Christmas market attack last week in Germany, the Interior Ministry said. Italian authorities were using extra police patrols and camera surveillance around Rome, while pilgrims faced metal detectors and other security checks to access St. Peter's Square via a reinforced police barricade passage. Francis, who turned 88 last week, went into the Christmas week and Jubilee launch with a cold that forced him to deliver his weekly Sunday blessing from indoors. But he appeared in fine form Tuesday night. His health and stamina, already compromised because of his tendency to get bronchitis, are a concern given the rigorous calendar of events during the Holy Year. One of the highlights will be the canonization of the teenage internet whiz Carlo Acutis, considered the first millennial and digital-era saint, during the Jubilee dedicated to adolescents in April. This week, Francis also delivers his annual 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) speech on Christmas Day from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica. In addition to the outing at Rebibbia, he will celebrate New Year’s Eve vespers and a New Year’s Day Mass. The city of Rome entered the Jubilee with some trepidation. It has undergone two years of traffic-clogging public works upgrades of transportation, hospital emergency rooms and other vital services, testing residents' patience. But only about a third of the 323 projects have been completed, and the city is already groaning under the weight of overtourism. Visitors have returned to Italy in droves following COVID-19, and the explosion of short-term vacation rentals has exacerbated a housing crisis. Some of Rome's prized monuments have reopened recently, including the Trevi Fountain. And the main Jubilee project was finished just in time: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square, was unveiled Monday. Vatican officials insist that Rome has a tradition of welcoming pilgrims and point to how past Jubilees have left their mark on the Eternal City’s urban and spiritual landscape. The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475, and the big Vatican garage was built for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II. Pope Boniface VII called the first Holy Year in 1300, and in recent times, they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of purgatory free' card. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy, and the next one is planned for 2033 to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church’s third millennium. The one before that, in 1975, was notable because Pope Paul VI was nearly hit by falling plaster when he opened the Holy Door. The door was still behind a fake wall and Paul had used a ceremonial hammer to bang on it three times to open it. The fake wall now is removed well in advance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7912956.html	2024-12-24T13:26:06-08:00

Iran cyberspace council votes to lift ban on WhatsApp	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran's top council responsible for safeguarding the internet voted Tuesday to lift a ban on the popular messaging application WhatsApp, which has been subject to restrictions for over two years, state media reported. 'The ban on WhatsApp and Google Play was removed by unanimous vote of the members of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace,' the official IRNA news agency said. The council is headed by the president, and its members include the parliament speaker, the head of the judiciary and several ministers. It was not immediately clear when the decision would come into force. 'Restrictions ... achieved nothing but anger' The move has sparked a debate in Iran, with critics of the restrictions arguing the controls were costly for the country. 'The restrictions have achieved nothing but anger and added costs to people's lives,' presidential adviser Ali Rabiei said on X Tuesday. 'President Masoud Pezeshkian believes in removing restrictions and does not consider the bans to be in the interest of the people and the country. All experts also believe that this issue is not beneficial to the country's security,' Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday. Lifting restrictions 'a gift to enemies' Others, however, warned against lifting the restrictions. The reformist Shargh daily on Tuesday reported that 136 lawmakers in the 290-member parliament sent a letter to the council saying the move would be a 'gift to [Iran's] enemies.' The lawmakers called for allowing access to restricted online platforms only 'if they are committed to the values of Islamic society and comply with the laws of' Iran. Iranian officials have in the past called for the foreign companies that own popular international apps to introduce representative offices in Iran. Meta, the American giant that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has said it had no intention of setting up offices in the Islamic republic, which remains under U.S. sanctions. Iranians have over the years grown accustomed to using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to bypass internet restrictions. Other popular social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, remain blocked after being banned in 2009. Telegram was also banned by a court order in April 2018. Instagram and WhatsApp were added to the list of blocked applications following nationwide protests that erupted after the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's dress code for women. Hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, were killed in the subsequent months-long nationwide protests, and thousands of demonstrators were arrested. Pezeshkian, who took office in July, had vowed during his campaign to ease the long-standing internet restrictions. in the past several years, Iran has introduced domestic applications to supplant popular foreign ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-cyberspace-council-votes-to-lift-ban-on-whatsapp/7912891.html	2024-12-24T12:45:09-08:00	
Amsterdam court sentences 5 men for violence linked to Ajax-Maccabi soccer game	The Hague, Netherlands — An Amsterdam district court on Tuesday sentenced five men to up to six months in prison for violence that erupted around a UEFA Europa League football match between the Dutch club Ajax and Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv in November. The riots, which caused an international outcry and accusations of deliberate antisemitic attacks, left five people in the hospital and 20 others with minor injuries. More than 60 people were detained. The court on Tuesday sentenced one man to 6 months in prison, another to 2 1/2 months and two to 1 month in jail. A fifth defendant received 100 hours of community service. A series of violent incidents took place between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soccer fans around the soccer match. Some of the violence was condemned as antisemitic, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering to evacuate Maccabi supporters. The violence, which garnered headlines worldwide, damaged Amsterdam’s reputation as a beacon of tolerance and a haven for persecuted religions, including Jews. 'It seems that the violence arose from strong pro-Palestine sentiments and dissatisfaction with the situation in Gaza, and related anger against the Israelis present,' the prosecutors’ office said in a statement at the conclusion of hearings two weeks ago. The five defendants, who are all Dutch residents and aged between 19 and 32, were accused of public violence, theft and assault. The November 8 game was allowed to go ahead after the Netherlands’ counterterror watchdog found there was no 'concrete threat' to Israeli fans, and the match wasn’t considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena. According to an investigation, the day before the game the authorities reported several incidents, including Israeli fans tearing a Palestinian flag from an Amsterdam building and attacking a taxi. Six more suspects will have their trials at a later date, including three minors. Under Dutch rules, proceedings for juveniles are held behind closed doors. Police are continuing to investigate the violence and have released images of several suspects they want to identify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amsterdam-court-sentences-5-men-for-violence-linked-to-ajax-maccabi-soccer-game/7912895.html	2024-12-24T12:20:18-08:00	
Hong Kong issues arrest warrants, bounties for 6 democracy activists	Hong Kong police on Tuesday announced a new round of arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists based abroad, with bounties set at 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $129,000, for information leading to their arrests. The six activists are wanted on charges that include secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The move underscores how the government of Hong Kong — which is a special administration region of China — targets activists living in exile in retaliation for their work. The six include Chloe Cheung, a 19-year-old activist with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong; Carmen Lau, a former district councilor and current activist with the Hong Kong Democracy Council; and Tony Chung, the former leader of the now-defunct pro-independence group Studentlocalism. 'Fear cannot restrain me. Suppression cannot silence me. I will wear this burden with pride and without fear,' Cheung, who is based in the United Kingdom, wrote in a statement on Tuesday. Lau said she would not let the arrest warrant and bounty deter her work. 'I have always considered serving Hong Kongers and fighting for freedom and democracy my lifelong obligation,' she said in a statement on social media platform X. 'As a member of the diaspora and as a Hong Konger, I swear to put our fight for Hong Kong before anything else, even before myself,' Lau added. Others on the list Tuesday include Chung Kim-wah, a former member of independent polling organization Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute; Joseph Tay, co-founder of Canada-based group HongKonger Station; and YouTuber Victor Ho. The Hong Kong government has previously issued two rounds of arrest warrants and bounties for prominent pro-democracy activists, including ex-lawmakers Ted Hui and Nathan Law, and activists Anna Kwok, Joey Siu and Frances Hui. The latest arrest warrants bring the total number of wanted people to 19. Government orders passports canceled In a separate move on Tuesday, the Hong Kong government also issued orders for the cancellation of passports belonging to seven 'absconders,' including Kwok, who leads the Hong Kong Democracy Council; Siu, a prominent activist; and Frances Hui, with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong. 'Our crime? Calling on the world to hold the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] accountable for violating the autonomy of our home,' Frances Hui said in a Tuesday statement on X. She made the statement in solidarity with her colleague Cheung. The passports of former Hong Kong lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok also were canceled. The orders were made under Hong Kong's domestic national security law, which is known as Article 23. 'This is one of the first instances in which Hong Kong authorities have utilized one of the provisions in Article 23,' Siu said in a post on X. 'The international community must continue to monitor its use and implications closely. And of course, please continue to watch our friends who are still in prison.' Siu, who is an American citizen, also called on the U.S. government to do more to help exiled Hong Kongers who are targeted with transnational repression. Group calls charges 'absurd' The free expression group Article 19 condemned the arrest warrants and passport cancellations as 'an outrageous escalation in transnational repression against overseas Hong Kongers.' 'These absurd, arbitrary charges only serve to further drive home the farce of Hong Kong authorities claiming to follow the rule of law,' Michael Caster, the head of Article 19's China program, said in a statement on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Security Bureau did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The arrest warrants and passport cancellations come as the trial against pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai continues in Hong Kong. The trial is widely viewed as a politically motivated sham. Lai, 77, rejects the national security charges against him. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-issues-arrest-warrants-bounties-for-6-democracy-activists/7912819.html	2024-12-24T11:49:08-08:00	
Big banks, business groups sue US Federal Reserve over annual 'stress tests'	Major banks and business groups sued the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, alleging the U.S. central bank's annual 'stress tests' of Wall Street firms violate the law. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, claims the Fed's practice of determining how big banks perform against hypothetical economic turmoil, and assigning capital requirements accordingly, do not follow proper administrative procedure. Plaintiffs included the Bank Policy Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bank Association. The lawsuit marks the latest example of the banking industry growing bolder and challenging in court their regulators' powers, particularly in the wake of recent Supreme Court rulings placing fresh restrictions on administrative authority. In June, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to such power by overturning a 1984 precedent that granted deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The so-called 'Chevron doctrine' had called for judges to defer to reasonable federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous. While the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed following the global financial crisis broadly requires the Fed to test banks' balance sheets, the capital adequacy analysis the Fed performs as part of tests, or the resulting capital it directs lenders to set aside, are not mandated by law. Specifically, the groups are calling for the Fed to make public and subject to feedback the now-confidential models the regulators use to gauge bank performance, as well as details of the annual scenarios they create to test for weaknesses. The groups said they did not want to kill the stress testing program, which provides an annual bill of health to the nation's biggest firms, but argue the process needs to be more transparent and responsive to public feedback. On Monday, the Fed announced plans to pursue similar changes ahead of the 2025 exams, citing recent legal developments, but the industry opted to proceed with its lawsuit. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit on Tuesday. 'The opaque nature of these tests undermines their value for providing meaningful insights into bank resilience,' Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement. 'We remain hopeful the Fed will address long-standing issues with the stress tests, but this litigation preserves our ability to seek legal remedies if the Fed falls short.' These tests, which banks have complained for years are opaque and subjective, are a central piece of the U.S. regulatory bank-capital structure. The Fed has long resisted calls to completely open up the testing process, due to concerns that it could make it easier for banks to clear the exams. How banks perform on the test informs how much capital they must set aside to meet their obligations and dictate the scope of dividend payouts and stock buybacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-banks-business-groups-sue-us-federal-reserve-over-annual-stress-tests-/7912850.html	2024-12-24T11:46:02-08:00	
Report alleges shrinking media space in Zambia	Lusaka — A new report says that media freedoms in Zambia are under attack. The report says more than 60 percent of people surveyed think that the media cannot operate freely, due to frequent instances of harassment and intimidation faced by journalists and bloggers. The Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, launched its report on December 17 in Zambia’s capital, Lusaka. MISA chairperson Lorraine Mwanza said that journalists in Zambia still face censorship and violence in the course of their duties. Both she and the report cited the case of Thomas Zgambo, an investigative journalist, who has been arrested three times in the last 13 months for writing stories that Zambian authorities deemed overly critical. Zgambo faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of charges that include libel and sedition. Zgambo told VOA that he will not stop writing and reporting. 'All the three cases basically, it’s a journalist trying to find answers on behalf of the public but I’m now in court because instead of the government answering, they have decided to use the police to criminalize journalism and take me to court. So I’m in court with three criminal charges. I’m in court with three criminal cases before three different magistrates,' he said. Zgambo’s legal troubles started in November 2023, when he was arrested in connection with an article in which he alleged a government institution was renting a property from President Hakainde Hichilema. In August of this year, he was arrested for a 2022 story about an allegedly illegal government purchase of fertilizer. And in October, he was arrested for an article he wrote about food imports. The most recent arrest came hours after President Hichilema promised to uphold press freedom in a speech read on his behalf by chief government spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa. Joan Chirwa, the founder of a Zambian media advocacy group, the Free Press Initiative, told VOA she agrees with the findings of the MISA report. 'We have seen political party figures still storming radio stations to disturb programming and threaten journalists there,' she said. 'We have seen journalists being detained by the police. We have also seen journalists been lumped with criminal charges just because of what they have written and our biggest worry right now is what may likely happen as we get closer to the 2026 election.' Chirwa criticized colonial-era laws being used by authorities against journalists in Zambia. These include criminal defamation, sedition and state security laws which Chirwa says are a hindrance to journalists playing their role as a watchdog on the government. However, at the launch of the MISA report, an official at the information ministry, Mumanga Morden Mayembe, argued that the government has not interfered with media freedoms at all. Mayembe said the government has opened up the media space, as evidenced by its licensing of more than 200 radio stations, 50 TV stations and many online platforms. 'When platforms are few, then there will be few people expressing themselves on those platforms. When we just had [one] tv station, for you to appear on tv you needed to be a president, you needed to be a vice president, a minister or at least somebody with a name in society,' said Mayembe. However, Muthoki Mumo, the Africa program coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a recent statement that the continued harassment of Zgambo paints a stark picture of the emptiness behind the government ‘s pledges to protect journalists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-alleges-shrinking-media-space-in-zambia-/7912610.html	2024-12-24T10:17:02-08:00	
Vietnam signs $286 million in defense contracts at 2024 international expo	Taipei, Taiwan — Vietnam's ambitions to modernize its military and diversify international partnerships were on full display at the 2024 Vietnam International Defense Expo, an exhibition that concluded with defense enterprises signing 16 contracts worth over $286 million, along with 17 strategic cooperation agreements with international defense firms. The exhibition, which took place from Dec. 19-22 in Hanoi, featured more than 240 defense industry companies and represented 49 countries. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said the expo was 'an affirmation of Vietnam's role and contribution in international defense cooperation' and a 'symbol of trust, respect and goodwill in cooperation between nations for a world of peace, stability and prosperity.' Experts noted that the vast number of international companies at the exhibition reflected Vietnam’s long-term approach to diversifying its foreign partners. 'If you look at the list of invited firms and defense firms and companies at the expo, you can see there’s a wide range of companies from many different countries,' said Hanh Nguyen, a research fellow at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies based in Japan. 'This decision reflects Vietnam's long-standing foreign policy approach, which is to strive to build partnerships with every country regardless of their political system or ideology,' he added. Bich Tran, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, shared a similar sentiment, explaining to VOA that the presence of Chinese, Russian and Western countries at the expo showed that Vietnam is committed to the principle of diversifying its foreign relations. 'Vietnam has talked about diversifying its arms supplies for many years, but I think Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced Vietnam to facilitate the process. So with this expo, [Vietnam] has the opportunity to talk with many different partners, to look around to see what will work,' Tran said. American firms Boeing and Lockheed Martin, French company Airbus, and Chinese state-owned China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) attended the expo. NORINCO's participation marked the first time for a Chinese company. Concurrently, Vietnam’s general-secretary of the Communist Party, To Lam, met with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun. Despite the active participation and discussion between Beijing and Hanoi officials, Nguyen said the expo is unlikely to become a breakthrough point for arms sales between the two countries, noting that Vietnam has concerns over the transparency performance of Chinese military equipment. Nguyen The Phuong, a doctoral candidate in maritime security at the University of New South Wales, told VOA that 'Vietnam will never, ever buy any lethal weapons from China,' adding that Vietnam’s reluctance to buy weapons from China is a 'long-standing principle dating back to the ‘70s and '80s.' Phuong said Vietnam is preparing to advance and upgrade its outdated systems, 'focusing on the modernization of the Vietnamese army and maritime defense needs.' 'Vietnam is trying to modernize its navy and air force and trying to turn them into modernized and capable services after 2030. So, there are a lot of things that the Vietnamese military wants to improve from buying more aircraft for its air force, building more warships for its navy, and especially the capability to monitor.' Contributing to Hanoi’s need to modernize is the potential for conflict in the South China Sea, a geopolitically disputed territory that is both a critical maritime route for global trade and a region rich in resources, including oil, natural gas and fish stock. On Dec. 10, the South China Morning Post reported that Vietnam is actively building military facilities on several islands and reefs in the Spratly Islands — key territories in the South China Sea. 'Vietnam's military strategy in the South China Sea can be summed up in one word: deterrence. Or more precisely, deterrence by denial,' said Phuong, explaining that Vietnam’s decisions at the expo reflect an ambition to increase its coastal military capabilities. Another takeaway from the expo is Hanoi’s cooperation with the United States. Speaking at the expo, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Marc Napper said the United States' goal is to ensure that Vietnam 'has everything it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace.' Tran said this goal demonstrates that the U.S.-Vietnam defense cooperation is shifting from a single arms assistance model to a broader multilateral cooperation framework.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-signs-286-million-in-defense-contracts-at-2024-international-expo/7912717.html	2024-12-24T09:55:45-08:00	
Syrians welcome new rulers' pledge of moderation but are concerned about extremists in their midst	Washington — With the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) consolidating power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad, many Syrians fear the influence of extremist factions within the Islamist organization. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, emerged as the de facto ruler of Syria after Assad’s fall on December 8, following an 11-day rebel offensive. Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, the HTS was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. Since seizing control of Damascus, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa -- formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has adopted a more moderate stance, pledging to establish a state founded on tolerance and coexistence among the country’s diverse ethnic and religious groups. Despite such overtures, many Syrians remain skeptical about the new rulers’ ability to rein in the more radical elements within HTS. Al-Masri, a resident of Damascus who provided only his last name, acknowledged that the new authorities have largely maintained order in the capital and elsewhere but expressed concerns that this stability could be short-lived. 'We know that Hayat Tahir al-Sham is trying to change, and we welcome that,' he told VOA via a messaging app. 'But there are two things that people in my circle are really concerned about. One is how genuine al-Sharaa is, and the other is how much control he really has over the more radical people in his group,' said al-Masri, who is a Sunni Muslim. His fears were echoed by another resident of Damascus who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. 'Syrians in general, including the conservative ones, are not inclined to extremism,' the resident said. 'If al-Jolani keeps his promises and controls his men, then Syrians will support him. But if extremists dominate, Syrians will rise against them just as they rose against Bashar al-Assad,' the resident added, referring to the popular uprising against the former regime that began in 2011. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, an expert on Islamist groups in Syria, says one of the main tensions he sees is 'between the HTS leadership under al-Jolani and the action of individual members who for years were fed propaganda' about other religions and sects. 'They may collectively impute guilt to Alawites and others like Christians and engage in attacks and insults,' he told VOA. On Monday, armed gunmen burned down a Christmas tree in the Christian-majority town of Suqaylabiya in Hama province in central Syria. Shortly after that, the HTS issued a statement saying the perpetrators, whom it described as foreign fighters, will be punished. While their exact numbers are unknown, fighters from several countries have joined HTS over the years, with Uighurs from China’s Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang being most notable. Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there have not been any indications of opposition within the main ranks of HTS toward al-Jolani’s current moderate approach. 'Even if there are people on their farther right flank that might be upset with them, it is plausible that if they then act out, the HTS and the caretaker government will arrest them,' he told VOA. 'I’m sure there are a lot of internal discussions and debates about how far they can go,' Zelin added. 'There are also the questions for some of them like ‘We will wait and see what this is like until the transition is over,’ and if this is just a public relations campaign, then maybe we will see some differences and changes and more reactions,' Zelin added. HTS has appointed a caretaker government, composed of loyalists, to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots Portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, believes 'that ultimately al-Sharaa will sideline the more extremist factions within HTS, the caretaker government, and the new government post-March 1.' She told VOA that this approach could particularly work if foreign governments 'keep normalization, sectoral sanctions relief, and delisting [from lists of designated terrorist groups] as an opportunity and a ‘carrot’ to incentivize behavioral change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrians-welcome-new-rulers-pledge-of-moderation-but-are-concerned-about-extremists-in-their-midst-/7912678.html	2024-12-24T09:51:51-08:00	
Blast at Turkish ammunition factory kills 11 people	Istanbul — An explosion at an ammunition factory in northwest Turkey left 11 dead and five injured Tuesday morning. The blast occurred in Balikesir province, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. The factory is in a rural area away from population centers. Balikesir Governor Ismail Ustaoglu said the explosion collapsed the capsule production building and the surrounding buildings had minor damage. 'The explosion was due to a technical issue. There is no possibility of sabotage,' he added. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc wrote on social media platform X that public prosecutors have been assigned to investigate the cause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blast-at-turkish-ammunition-factory/7912650.html	2024-12-24T08:58:22-08:00	
Chad’s online journalists decry ban ahead of December 29 elections	Yaounde — Online media journalists in Chad are voicing dissatisfaction and frustration over officials’ refusal to lift a ban on the broadcasting of audiovisual content. The High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, accuses journalists of reposting videos without the content producers’ permission but journalists say they are being silenced from reporting on critical election issues. Journalists reporting for online media platforms say they are surprised that Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, has refused to respect a December 20 Supreme Court decision ordering an immediate end to a ban on broadcasting online media content. Bello Bakary Mana, the president of the Association of Online Media of Chad, Mana took part in a protest Tuesday in N'djamena against what he calls a deliberate attempt by HAMA to silence Chad's online media. Mana said several hundred online reporters assisted by local radio, print and TV journalists are in N'djamena to let the world know that the media is being silenced in Chad. 'They will continue protesting until HAMA stops threatening journalists and lifts what he calls its illegal December 4 ban on the broadcast of online audiovisual content,' he said. Bello, who spoke to VOA from N'djamena via a messaging app, also said only police can compel HAMA to respect the lifting of a ban on the broadcasting of online audiovisual content, but that police are controlled by the government, which ordered the ban. HAMA says it prohibited online newspapers from broadcasting audiovisual content because many of the newspapers refused to obey an order earlier this year to stop reposting videos from foreign sources, including international media outlets, without the author or media outlets’ permission, as required by law. Journalists say the decision, taken before elections on December 29 to mark an end to Chad's three-year transitional period, is an indication the government, through HAMA, wants to silence online media that the government has described as highly critical. HAMA has always complained that online media regularly publish unverifiable information about President Mahamat Idriss Deby. Deby became Chad's transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power. Deby was declared the winner of Chad's contested May 6 presidential polls amid opposition and civil society allegations the victory was stolen. Government officials in Chad complained after the presidential elections that online media were reporting on and posting videos of opposition and civil society members saying that Deby wants to continue his late father's rule, according to local media. Journalists in Chad say by banning online audiovisual content, HAMA wants to silence online media that have been reporting that Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, wants to use the polls to consolidate its grip on power at all costs. Abderrahmane Barka, the president of HAMA, created by Chad's government to regulate the media in the central African state, says Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority that he leads noticed that before elections, rich politicians hire media organizations to broadcast campaign messages, and that poses a disadvantage to politicians who don’t have a lot of money. He says HAMA is reinforcing the law, which requires the media to give equal access without pay to all political parties taking part in elections. Barka spoke on state TV on Tuesday. He said Chadian laws do not permit online newspapers to broadcast audiovisual content but did not comment on whether a Supreme Court decision to lift the ban will be respected. Chad's online journalists say the ban has affected about 60% of their audience who no longer have access to online media. They say they are surprised that HAMA also ordered them to stop broadcasting audiovisual content that they produce locally. Before the ban and ahead of the December 29 elections, HAMA suspended all interactive online, radio and TV programs, arguing that the media do not have sufficient human resources to produce such programs during election periods — a claim the media deny. Last week, Reporters Without Borders asked Chad to reverse its decision and lift the ban. The media rights group says the job of HAMA is regulating and not prohibiting the media from informing, educating and entertaining their audience. RSF acknowledges that broadcasting content without the consent of the producers is wrong and has asked Chad to allow online reporters to broadcast local content they create.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-s-online-journalists-decry-ban-ahead-of-december-29-elections-/7912532.html	2024-12-24T08:40:01-08:00	
Pakistan resumes senior-level contacts with Afghanistan's Taliban to address mutual tensions	Islamabad — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan hosted meetings Tuesday with a high-level delegation from neighboring Pakistan, marking the resumption of such interactions after a year-long pause due to terrorism allegations. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s newly appointed special envoy for Afghan affairs, led his country’s team at the talks in Kabul with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, among others. Muttaqi’s office said in a post-meeting statement that the delegations focused on enhancing diplomatic, trade, and transit relations between the countries, which share a nearly 2,600-kilometer border. The chief Taliban diplomat stated that Kabul 'desires positive relations' with Islamabad. Muttaqi said without elaborating that to develop trade and transit ties further, both governments 'must enhance mutual coordination, facilitate travelers’ cross-border movement, and address issues straining relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban’s statement quoted Pakistani envoy Sadiq as saying that his mission was to 'bolster' bilateral political, economic, commercial, and transit relations. 'Held wide-ranging discussions. Agreed to work together to further strengthen bilateral cooperation as well as for peace and progress in the region,' the Pakistani envoy wrote on his X social media platform. Sadiq’s predecessor, Asif Ali, visited Kabul in September 2023 when Pakistan was experiencing a dramatic rise in terrorist attacks attributed to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, with Islamabad persistently alleging the militant group was orchestrating the deadly cross-border violence from its Afghan 'hideouts.' TTP attacks have since intensified and killed hundreds of Pakistani civilians as well as security forces, leading to a further deterioration in relations. 'Given the current circumstances, we must expedite our collaborative efforts to safeguard the relationship between our peoples and ensure regional stability and development,' Haqqani’s office quoted him Tuesday as telling the Pakistani delegation. He stressed 'the urgency of accelerating joint efforts to resolve security and political challenges,' according to the statement. Taliban leaders have consistently denied allegations that Afghan territory is being used as a launching pad for attacks. The de facto Afghan government maintains it does not support the TTP or any other foreign militant group, describing the violence in Pakistan as an 'internal problem' for the neighboring country to resolve rather than blaming Kabul for the crisis. Afghanistan is landlocked, relying heavily on Pakistani overland routes and seaports to conduct bilateral and international trade. Tensions over terrorism charges have led to a significant decline in Afghan trade and transit activities through Pakistan in recent months. The Taliban swept back to power in 2021, but no country has officially recognized them as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. Several neighboring and regional countries, including Pakistan, China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have retained their embassies in Kabul since the Taliban takeover, allowing the fundamentalist de facto rulers to take charge of Afghan diplomatic missions in their respective territories. Western countries have refused to open official contacts with the Taliban over their sweeping restrictions on Afghan women’s access to education, work, and most aspects of public life. The United Nations has turned down Taliban requests to let them represent Afghanistan at the global organization, citing the treatment of women. Taliban leaders defend their governance in line with Islamic law, known as Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting international criticism as interference in the country’s internal matters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-resumes-senior-level-contacts-with-afghanistan-s-taliban-to-address-mutual-tensions/7912605.html	2024-12-24T08:31:44-08:00	
People in Russia 'need the truth,' says journalist who sacrificed home and security to keep reporting	Prague — The list of sacrifices that Alesya Marokhovskaya has made to keep reporting on Russia from exile runs long: her home, her country, family, friends, culture, safety. This month alone, Russian authorities searched the home of the journalist’s parents in the eastern port town of Magadan and opened a criminal case against Marokhovskaya for violating Russia’s foreign agent law. When she spoke with VOA in Prague this fall, Marokhovskaya searched for words to explain why the sacrifices are worth it. Eventually, she settled on the Russian people. 'They’re poisoning Russians,' she said, explaining how she views Kremlin propaganda. 'Information in our world is one of the most important things, and I am completely against manipulating people’s minds.' As editor-in-chief of the exiled Russian investigative outlet IStories, breaking through propaganda to bring ordinary Russians the truth is Marokhovskaya’s core focus. But in doing so, Marokhovskaya and her team face legal threats and surveillance, even while based in Prague. Marokhovskaya had not planned to leave Russia, even when Moscow declared the journalist a so-called foreign agent in 2021. Instead, the reporter followed the strict rules that accompany the designation. For months, she labeled all of her social media posts — even ones that were photos of her dog — as the work of a so-called foreign agent, and she submitted financial reports to the Justice Ministry. 'It was really humiliating,' Marokhovskaya said. But she followed the rules because she wanted to keep reporting from inside Russia. 'For me, it was important to stay in Russia as long as I could. Because I was thinking there is no way to be a Russian journalist not inside Russia,' Marokhovskaya said. But when Russia invaded Ukraine, Marokhovskaya said it became clear that Moscow would ramp up its persecution of independent journalists. Soon after, she and many of her colleagues at IStories fled for the Czech capital of Prague. At the time, Marokhovskaya worried the relationship between IStories and its primary audience inside Russia wouldn’t survive the distance. 'It was our fear to become media for immigrants. We want to be media for Russians [inside Russia] in the first place,' Marokhovskaya said. But IStories survived. 'I still have this fear, but now I see we can work in such circumstances.' Marokhovskaya has worked for IStories, or 'Important Stories,' since it was founded in 2020. In September, at the age of 29, she became the outlet’s editor-in-chief. She took over the role from IStories founder Roman Anin, who is now the publisher. A former Novaya Gazeta reporter, Anin says he never expected something as extreme as the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he predicted reporters would eventually have to leave because of Moscow’s rising repression. 'It was obvious that at some point, they will come after us as well,' Anin said. To Anin, a focus on collaborative journalism is one of the things that makes IStories distinct. The outlet also prioritizes publishing investigations and exclusive stories instead of daily news that other outlets are covering. 'The main job of reporters is actually to find the truth, not to republish it,' Anin said. Russia has labeled IStories as a foreign agent and an undesirable organization. The latter exposes its staffers, sources and donors to potential fines, criminal charges and jail time. That harassment shows how impactful IStories’ work has been, according to Karol Luczka, who covers Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'Investigative journalism definitely is the kind of journalism which angers political decision-makers the most,' he said. As the outlet’s new top editor, Marokhovskaya is tasked with leading what has become one of the most prominent exiled investigative Russian news outlets at a time when the stakes are especially high, she said. With the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war looming, Kremlin-backed harassment against exiled journalists posing a daily threat, and Russia’s future remaining uncertain, Marokhovskaya says their work is all the more important. Among her priorities is figuring out how to maintain the connection between IStories and its audience inside Russia — and, ideally, how to grow that audience. 'When you are living in Russia, you are surrounded by propaganda,' she said. 'Lots of people in Russia, they need the truth.' IStories doesn’t have much of a problem reaching people inside Russia who already oppose President Vladimir Putin and his war. Marokhovskaya wants to turn her focus to those who aren’t necessarily pro- or anti-Putin but lie somewhere in the ambivalent middle. 'These people are of interest to us. It’s [a] potential audience,' Marokhovskaya said. Part of that strategy is talking to people in a way that doesn’t isolate them, says Artem, the head of the IStories video department. 'We don’t say to them that you’re idiots, that you’re war criminals,' Artem said. 'We just present real life in Russia as it is. We’re talking to real people. We’re talking about their problems. We’re always trying to find something that’s interesting to just ordinary people.' A former journalist with Russian state-run media, Artem requested to be identified by only his first name for security reasons. Video is a primary focus at IStories. The site publishes on YouTube, where IStories has nearly 720,000 subscribers, and where most of its videos attract around 1 million views. In August, Russian authorities appeared to begin throttling YouTube loading speeds in an apparent attempt to limit access. Artem admitted he’s concerned about how that will affect IStories. The YouTube channel and videos have made an impact. A 2022 documentary that featured a Russian soldier confessing to killing a Ukrainian civilian has more than 2.5 million views. It also became the center of a lawsuit in Russia. The documentary’s lead reporter — Ekaterina Fomina, who now works at TV Rain — and IStories founder Anin are accused of spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the Russian military. The pair are being tried in absentia and reject the charges. That lawsuit underscores the Moscow-backed threats facing exiled Russian journalists in a process known as transnational repression. Legal harassment — or 'lawfare' — is common. Surveillance, hacking and even suspected poisonings have also been documented. Over the course of several months last year, threatening messages were directed at Marokhovskaya and her colleague that suggested they were being surveilled. 'I’m physically in danger here. I put my family in potential danger,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It’s a big sacrifice.' Russia’s Prague embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. With threats high, many of the outlet’s staffers work anonymously. 'It’s a pity, but it’s part of our work now,' Artem said. 'We’re fighting with criminals in the Kremlin, and they don’t follow rules. They just do what they want, and we’ll do the same,' he added. The personal cost of that work is high. But, said Anin, 'It’s so important in these historical moments to preserve the truth about what was really going on in the country, to preserve the truth about the crimes of Putin’s regime.' And for Marokhovskaya, it’s comforting to know that she’s doing the right thing for her country. 'It’s really simple to me,' she said. 'I’m a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they’re not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-istories-russia-media-exile/7912431.html	2024-12-24T08:06:39-08:00

'We don’t say to them that you’re idiots, that you’re war criminals,' Artem said. 'We just present real life in Russia as it is. We’re talking to real people. We’re talking about their problems. We’re always trying to find something that’s interesting to just ordinary people.' A former journalist with Russian state-run media, Artem requested to be identified by only his first name for security reasons. Video is a primary focus at IStories. The site publishes on YouTube, where IStories has nearly 720,000 subscribers, and where most of its videos attract around 1 million views. In August, Russian authorities appeared to begin throttling YouTube loading speeds in an apparent attempt to limit access. Artem admitted he’s concerned about how that will affect IStories. The YouTube channel and videos have made an impact. A 2022 documentary that featured a Russian soldier confessing to killing a Ukrainian civilian has more than 2.5 million views. It also became the center of a lawsuit in Russia. The documentary’s lead reporter — Ekaterina Fomina, who now works at TV Rain — and IStories founder Anin are accused of spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the Russian military. The pair are being tried in absentia and reject the charges. That lawsuit underscores the Moscow-backed threats facing exiled Russian journalists in a process known as transnational repression. Legal harassment — or 'lawfare' — is common. Surveillance, hacking and even suspected poisonings have also been documented. Over the course of several months last year, threatening messages were directed at Marokhovskaya and her colleague that suggested they were being surveilled. 'I’m physically in danger here. I put my family in potential danger,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It’s a big sacrifice.' Russia’s Prague embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. With threats high, many of the outlet’s staffers work anonymously. 'It’s a pity, but it’s part of our work now,' Artem said. 'We’re fighting with criminals in the Kremlin, and they don’t follow rules. They just do what they want, and we’ll do the same,' he added. The personal cost of that work is high. But, said Anin, 'It’s so important in these historical moments to preserve the truth about what was really going on in the country, to preserve the truth about the crimes of Putin’s regime.' And for Marokhovskaya, it’s comforting to know that she’s doing the right thing for her country. 'It’s really simple to me,' she said. 'I’m a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they’re not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-in-russia-need-the-truth-says-journalist-who-sacrificed-home-and-security-to-keep-reporting/7912431.html	2024-12-24T07:34:09-08:00

American Airlines operations up and running again after technical issue grounded US flights	American Airlines flights were cleared to fly by regulators early Tuesday after a brief grounding due to a systemwide technical issue. Just before 7 a.m. Eastern time, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all American Airlines flights grounded in the U.S. at the airline’s request. American had reported a technical issue affecting its entire system with millions traveling for the holiday. In social media replies to frustrated travelers, the airline said: 'Our team is currently working to rectify this. Your continued patience is appreciated.' The company has not issued a press release explaining the issue and an email was not immediately returned. A post on the Federal Aviation Administration's website acknowledged the airline's request for a 'nationwide groundstop' for all American Airlines planes and their subsidiary airlines. The grounding occurred with millions of travelers expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through Jan. 2.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-airlines-operations-up-and-running-again-after-technical-issue-grounded-us-flights/7912411.html	2024-12-24T06:16:33-08:00	
Syrian authorities say armed groups will dissolve	Syria’s new authorities said Tuesday that armed groups in the country agreed to dissolve and be integrated into the Defense Ministry. A statement said the decision followed a meeting between leaders of the armed groups and Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebel advance that pushed longtime leader Bashar al-Assad from power. Rebels seized control of Syria’s capital December 8 after a lightning advance that saw them claim several key cities in a matter of days after many years of relative stalemate in the country’s 13-year civil war. Since Assad’s ouster, governments throughout the region have sent envoys to Damascus amid questions about Syria’s political future and concerns about additional instability in the region. One concern is the potential resurgence of the Islamic State group, which seized areas of eastern Syria in 2014 and western Iraq before losing much of that territory. The U.S. military said Monday it carried out an airstrike that killed two Islamic State militants in eastern Syria’s Deir Ezzour province. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the militants were 'moving a truckload of weapons, which were destroyed during the strike.'

Bethlehem is set to mark a second subdued Christmas during the war in Gaza	BETHLEHEM, West Bank — Bethlehem prepared Tuesday to mark another somber Christmas in the traditional birthplace of Jesus under the shadow of war in Gaza. The excitement and cheer that typically descends on the Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank on Christmas were nowhere to be found: The festive lights and giant tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing. Throngs of foreign tourists that usually fill the square weren’t expected and youth marching bands that gather each year to mark the holiday were absent. Palestinian security forces arranged barriers near the Nativity Church, built atop the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born, and a worker cleared garbage bins. 'Always the message of Bethlehem is a message of peace and hope,' said Mayor Anton Salman. 'And these days, we are also sending our message to the world: peace and hope, but insisting that the world must work to end our suffering as Palestinian people.' The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town's economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of it from the Christmas season. Salman said unemployment is hovering around 50% — higher than the 30% unemployment across the rest of the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Finance Ministry. The number of visitors to the town plunged from a pre-COVID high of around 2 million visitors per year in 2019 to fewer than 100,000 visitors in 2024, said Jiries Qumsiyeh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Tourism Ministry. Bethlehem is an important center in the history of Christianity, but Christians make up only a small percentage of the roughly 14 million people spread across the Holy Land. There are about 182,000 in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,300 in Gaza, according to the U.S. State Department. While the war in Gaza has deterred tourists and pilgrims alike, it has also prompted a surge of violence in the West Bank, with more than 800 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire and dozens of Israelis killed in militant attacks. Since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, access to and from Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass Israeli military checkpoints. Restrictions have also prevented some 150,000 Palestinians from leaving the territory to work in Israel, causing the economy there to contract by 25%. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there, while some 90% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. Officials say more than half of the dead are women and children, though they don't give a breakdown of how many are civilians and how many fighters. In the Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 250 hostages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bethlehem-is-set-to-mark-a-second-subdued-christmas-during-the-war-in-gaza-/7912280.html	2024-12-24T04:31:06-08:00	
Global hunger monitor says famine in war-torn Sudan is spreading	LONDON/CAIRO/DUBAI — Famine in Sudan has expanded to five areas and will likely spread to another five by May, the global hunger monitor reported Tuesday, while warring parties continue to disrupt humanitarian aid needed to alleviate one of the worst starvation crises in modern times. Famine conditions were confirmed in Abu Shouk and al-Salam, two camps for internally displaced people in al-Fashir, the besieged capital of North Darfur, as well as two other areas in South Kordofan state, according to the Famine Review Committee of the Integrated Food Phase Classification, or IPC. The committee also found famine, first identified in August, persists in North Darfur's Zamzam camp. The committee, which vets and verifies a famine finding, predicts famine will expand to five additional areas in North Darfur — Um Kadadah, Melit, al-Fashir, Tawisha and al-Lait — by May. The committee identified another 17 areas across Sudan at risk of famine. The IPC estimated about 24.6 million people - about half of all Sudanese - urgently need food aid through February, a sharp increase from the 21.1 million originally projected in June for the same period. The findings were published despite the Sudanese government's continued disruption of the IPC's process for analyzing acute food insecurity, which helps direct aid where it is most needed. On Monday, the government announced it was suspending its participation in the global hunger-monitoring system, saying it issues 'unreliable reports that undermine Sudan's sovereignty and dignity.' The IPC is an independent body funded by Western nations and overseen by 19 large humanitarian organizations and intergovernmental institutions. A linchpin in the world’s vast system for monitoring and alleviating hunger, it is designed to sound the alarm about developing food crises so organizations can respond and prevent famine and mass starvation. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are engaged in a civil war with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and are adamantly opposed to a famine declaration for fear it would result in diplomatic pressure to ease border controls and lead to greater foreign engagement with the RSF. In a Dec. 23 letter to the IPC, the famine review committee and diplomats, Sudan’s agriculture minister said the latest IPC report lacks updated malnutrition data and assessments of crop productivity during the recent summer rainy season. The growing season was successful, the letter says. It also notes 'serious concerns' about the IPC's ability to collect data from territories controlled by the RSF. Under the IPC system, a 'technical working group,' usually headed by the national government, analyzes data and periodically issues reports that classify areas on a one-to-five scale that slides from minimal to stressed, crisis, emergency and famine. In October, the Sudanese government temporarily stopped the government-led analysis, according to a document seen by Reuters. After resuming work, the technical working group stopped short of acknowledging famine. The Famine Review Committee report released today said the government-led group excluded key malnutrition data from its analysis. A recent Reuters investigation found that the Sudanese government obstructed the IPC’s work earlier this year, delaying by months a famine determination for the sprawling Zamzam camp for displaced people where residents have resorted to eating tree leaves to survive. The civil war that erupted in April 2023 has decimated food production and trade and driven more than 12 million Sudanese from their homes, making it the world’s largest displacement crisis. The RSF has looted commercial and humanitarian food supplies, disrupted farming and besieged some areas, making trade more costly and food prices unaffordable. The government also has blocked humanitarian organizations’ access to some parts of the country. 'We have the food. We have the trucks on the road. We have the people on the ground. We just need safe passage to deliver assistance,' said Jean-Martin Bauer, director of food security and nutrition analysis for the U.N.'s World Food Program. In response to questions from Reuters, the RSF said the accusations of looting were 'baseless.' The RSF also said millions of people in areas it controlled were facing 'the threat of hunger,' and that it was committed to 'fully facilitating the delivery of aid to those affected.' The government said that problems delivering aid were caused by the RSF. At least a dozen aid workers and diplomats contacted by Reuters for this report said tensions increased between the Sudanese government and humanitarian aid organizations after the IPC determined Zamzam was in famine in August. The sources said the government is slowing the aid response. The government’s general and military intelligence services oversee aid delivery, subjecting international aid approvals to the SAF's political and military goals, the sources said. The government is slow to approve visas for aid workers, and several aid workers said it has discouraged NGOs from providing relief in the hard-hit Darfur region, which is largely controlled by RSF forces. The government has told aid organizations 'there are no legitimate needs in Darfur, so you should not work there, and if you continue to respond to needs there, you should not expect visas,' said one senior aid official, who asked not to be named. The number of visa applications awaiting approval for non-UN aid workers has skyrocketed in the last four months, and the percentage approved has plummeted, according to data maintained by Sudan's INGO Forum, which represents and advocates for international non-governmental organizations in the country. The government didn't respond to specific questions about the blocking of visas. In the past, it has said that the majority of visa requests are approved. In October, the Sudanese government pressured the U.N. to remove the top humanitarian aid official for Sudan's embattled Darfur region after the person traveled there without government authorization, three sources told Reuters. Requests for authorization had stalled, the sources said. The government told the U.N. it would throw the official out if he was not withdrawn, the sources said. The U.N. complied. The government didn't respond to questions about the aid official's removal. A U.N. spokesperson said the organization doesn't comment on staff 'working arrangements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-hunger-monitor-says-famine-in-war-torn-sudan-is-spreading-/7912264.html	2024-12-24T04:14:35-08:00	
Mozambique’s highest court upholds victory for the ruling Frelimo Party	Maputo — Mozambique's top court has declared election victory for the country’s ruling Frelimo Party and its 47-year-old presidential candidate, Daniel Chapo, in an election process marred by widespread rigging that sparked nearly two months of violent protests, causing the deaths of more than 100 people and injuring several others. Frelimo has been in power for 49 years. After more than 55 days of waiting, the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, Lucia Ribeiro, on Monday acknowledged irregularities in the election but said this did not substantially influence the results, and that Daniel Chapo of the governing Frelimo Party won with 65.17% of the vote, while opposition politician Venâncio Mondlane had 24.29%. The Constitutional Council also gave Frelimo a majority in parliament and all the 10 provincial governors. The results were initially announced by the National Election Commission in late October and triggered protests for more than eight weeks after Mondlane rejected the result and called for protests that resulted in at least 130 deaths in clashes with the police. 'One, proclaims citizen Daniel Francisco Chapo, elected president of the Republic of Mozambique. Two, validates the results of the parliamentary elections on October 9, 2024,' said Ribeiro. According to the final ruling, for parliament, Frelimo's number of seats was cut from 195 to 169. The Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique, which supported Mondlane, remains the second-largest party. Its number of seats increased from 31 to 43. Mozambique held several elections on October 9: presidential, legislative and provincial. The results announced by the National Election Commission in October gave victory to Chapo. In his acceptance speech on Monday, Chapo said he is ready to serve the interests of all Mozambicans and not just for his party and promised to introduce several reforms. 'It has become clear during these days that our electoral system needs profound reforms, and we all agree,' said Chapo. 'We need to build a new democratic architecture that responds to the aspirations of our society and not just partisan interests. I want to take this opportunity to say that I am willing to lead this reform process of our society and not just partisan interests. I want to take this opportunity to say that I am willing to lead this reform process.' Soon after the announcement of the results, Mondlane’s supporters again protested in the capital, Maputo, burning tires and blocking roads. Mondlane accused Frelimo of rigging the vote and called for a national shutdown starting this Friday. Human rights activist and director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights Adriano Nuvunga says the results proclaimed by the Constitutional Council will only bring problems to the country instead of solving them. 'It is unbelievable that the Constitutional Council read these results knowing that the general state of the nation in Mozambique feels attacked by these results. This would have been the moment for the Council bringing the nation together, mobilizing to find a formula for everyone to feel represented in what will be the next government,' said Nuvunga. Multiple human rights organizations reported that violent and repressive measures were used by security forces against protesters who were taking part in peaceful demonstrations. At least 300 protesters have been arrested since October in connection with these demonstrations. With all the contesting parties rejecting the results on Monday, violent protests will continue in Mozambique at least for the coming weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-s-highest-court-upholds-victory-for-the-ruling-frelimo-party-/7912249.html	2024-12-24T03:50:29-08:00

Finnish youth taught how to spot disinformation	HELSINKI, FINLAND — Finland is consistently ranked as Europe's most media literate country and the skills needed to spot online hoaxes are on the school curriculum, amidst a boom of mis- and disinformation campaigns. 'Who knew what a troll was before?' literature and Finnish language teacher Saara Varmola asked her 14-to-15-year-old students, who all raised their hands during a class at a Helsinki school in November. 'Who produced the material that you watch, what do you produce yourself and whether you have an ethical responsibility,' Varmola tells AFP, as she lists the critical questions to ask when living in a global information environment increasingly characterized by misleading information. By teaching its citizens how to critically engage with media content to debunk hoaxes, mis- and disinformation, as well as to produce content of their own, Finland wants to promote media literacy as a civic skill. The Nordic country was among the first in Europe to outline a national policy for media literacy in 2013. Updated in 2019, the national policy ensures media literacy is integrated in subjects throughout education from early childhood to upper secondary classes. To enhance skills among adults and the elderly, libraries and NGOs are offering courses. 'Media literacy is essential to building societal resilience, and Finland realized this quite early on,' Anders Adlercreutz, Minister of Education, told AFP. ‘’As traditional media is responsible for less and less of the information we receive, it's especially important to be able to critically evaluate what you read,' he added. 'Not immune to influence' Considered a forerunner, Finland has been ranked first on the European Media Literacy Index every year since it was first published in 2017 by the Bulgarian Open Society Institute. The index compares 41 countries' resilience to disinformation based on indicators such as quality of education, media freedom and trust in society. Neighbours Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Sweden trailed Finland's top ranking last year. A collaborative approach between many sectors help explain Finland's success in promoting media literacy among its 5.5 million residents, according to Adlercreutz. 'It's not just the school, it's the media, the newspapers, businesses, the libraries, museums. Everybody sort of takes part in this work,' he said. According to Leo Pekkala, Deputy Director of Finland's National Audiovisual Institute (KAVI) -- an institution mandated to implement the country's media literacy policy -- it also boils down to Finns' trust in its societal institutions. 'We Finns still have a very strong trust in the defense forces, the army, the police and the government. We trust our politicians and we also trust the media,' he said. Still, between sharing a 1,340-kilometer border with Russia and facing the rise of artificial intelligence, Finland is not immune to the influence of dis- and misinformation campaigns, Adlercreutz warned. 'I'm not so sure that we have yet been tested fully in this matter', he said. Critical thinking key In the snow-covered school in Helsinki, Varmola handed out assignments to her students with questions related to online disinformation: 'Can youtubers and streamers mislead?' and 'Is sponsored content a way of influencing through information?' 'Yes, youtubers and streamers and people on social media can do it. In my opinion, it's something you come across,' 8th grader Bruno Kerman said in a discussion with some of his fellow students. 'Yes, and who is preventing them?' classmate Niilo Korkeaoja continued. The students said the education system had equipped them with abilities to spot suspicious information online, critically analyze content and verify sources they encounter on social media networks such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. 'School has taught me to interpret messages in the media, also those written between the lines,' Ronja Turunen, another student, said. The country has a long tradition of promoting media skills among its citizens — when its free comprehensive school system was introduced in the 1970's, the first education curriculum already referenced mass media education. While education has evolved and adapted to the changing media environment and the advent of digital technologies, the key objective of teaching critical thinking has persisted, Pekkala noted. 'Our overall objective is to promote the kind of skills that will enable people to think and act critically and be active members of a democratic society,' he said. A major challenge now is to keep all its citizens up to date with the rapid changes in the digital sphere, including for the country's growing elderly population who may never have learned how to detect fake news on the internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-youth-taught-how-to-spot-disinformation-/7912218.html	2024-12-24T02:58:38-08:00	
Japanese PM Ishiba: important to strengthen US-Japan alliance	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Tuesday he wanted to strengthen his country's alliance with the United States, as he pushed for as early as possible a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Japan is neighbors with an increasingly assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea that has been deepening military ties with Russia. 'I think it's important to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance even further... and share a common understanding of the situation in north-east Asia,' he said at a press conference, adding that no dates for a potential meeting were set yet. Ishiba, in office since October, has sought a meeting with Trump, but told reporters last month that the president-elect's camp had said meetings with world leaders were restricted under the Logan Act before Trump's January inauguration. Trump has met with Akie Abe, the widow of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ishiba also said his cabinet plans to approve on Dec. 27 a draft state budget for the next fiscal year from April. He also pledged to work on measures to raise minimum wages and to eliminate public concerns for the future to boost private consumption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-pm-ishiba-important-to-strengthen-us-japan-alliance/7912212.html	2024-12-24T02:38:19-08:00	
Explosion sinks Russian cargo ship in Mediterranean, Russian Foreign Ministry says	MOSCOW — An engine room explosion sank a Russian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria and two of its crew are missing, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. The vessel, built in 2009 and called ‘’Ursa Major,’’ was controlled by Oboronlogistika, a company that is part of the Russian Defense Ministry's military construction operations, which had previously said it was en route to the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok with two giant port cranes lashed to its deck. The Foreign Ministry's crisis center said in a statement that 14 of the ship's 16 crew members had been rescued and brought to Spain, but that two crew were still missing. It did not say what had caused the engine room explosion. Unverified video footage of the ship heavily listing to its starboard side with its bow much lower down in the water than usual was filmed on Dec. 23 by a passing ship and published on Russia's life.ru news outlet on Tuesday. Oboronlogistika, the ship's ultimate owner, said in a statement on Dec. 20 that the ship, which LSEG data showed was previously called Sparta III, had been carrying specialized port cranes due to be installed at the port of Vladivostok as well as parts for new ice-breakers. Two giant cranes could be seen strapped to the deck in the unverified video footage. LSEG ship tracking data shows the vessel departed from the Russian port of Saint Petersburg on Dec. 11 and was last seen sending a signal at 2204 GMT on Monday between Algeria and Spain. On leaving Saint Petersburg it had indicated that its next port of call was the Russian port of Vladivostok, not the Syrian port of Tartous which it has called at previously. The operator and owner is a company called SK-Yug, part of Oboronlogistika, according to LSEG data. Oboronlogistika and SK-Yug declined to comment on the ship's sinking. Spanish news outlet El Espanol said on its website that crew members had been evacuated to the Spanish port of Cartagena and that several vessels, including a Spanish Navy ship, had taken part in rescuing the crew. It said the vessel had been due to arrive in Vladivostok on Jan. 22.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-sinks-russian-cargo-ship-in-mediterranean-russian-foreign-ministry-says-/7912196.html	2024-12-24T01:47:34-08:00	
Ukrainian forces destroy 36 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 36 of the 60 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks.

Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram that the drone attacks and Russian shelling damaged several homes and a power line. In Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported the Russian attack damaged several homes. Officials in the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine said a farm building was damaged there. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday its air defenses destroyed four Ukrainian aerial drones, including three over the Rostov region and one over Voronezh. Both Rostov and Voronezh are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drones. The governors of Rostov and Voronezh each said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties as a result of the Ukrainian attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-forces-destroy-36-russian-drones/7912194.html	2024-12-24T01:43:12-08:00

UN investigative team says Syria's new authorities 'very receptive' to probe of Assad war crimes	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. organization assisting in investigating the most serious crimes in Syria said Monday the country’s new authorities were 'very receptive' to its request for cooperation during a just-concluded visit to Damascus, and it is preparing to deploy. The visit led by Robert Petit, head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria, was the first since the organization was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 2016. It was created to assist in evidence-gathering and prosecution of individuals responsible for possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since Syria’s civil war began in 2011. Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving documents and other evidence before it is lost. Since the rebel overthrow of Syria’s President Bashar Assad and the rebel opening of prisons and detention facilities there have been rising demands from Syrians for the prosecution of those responsible for atrocities and killings while he was in power. 'The fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground,' Petit said. 'Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold.' U.N. associate spokesperson Stephane Tremblay said Monday the investigative team 'is preparing for an operational deployment as early as possible and as soon as it is authorized to conduct activities on Syrian soil.' The spokesperson for the organization, known as the IIIM, who was on the trip with Petit, went further, telling The Associated Press: 'We are preparing to deploy on the expectation that we will get authorization.' 'The representatives from the caretaker authorities were very receptive to our request for cooperation and are aware of the scale of the task ahead,' the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of not being named. 'They emphasized that they will need expertise to help safeguard the newly accessible documentation.' The IIIM did not disclose which officials in the new government it met with or the site that Petit visited afterward. 'Even at one facility,' Petit said, 'the mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime’s atrocity crimes.' He said that a collective effort by Syrians, civil society organizations and international partners will be needed, as a priority, ' to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.' In June 2023, the 193-member General Assembly also established an Independent Institution of Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic to clarify the fate and whereabouts of more than 130,000 people missing as a result of the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-investigative-team-says-syria-s-new-authorities-very-receptive-to-probe-of-assad-war-crimes/7912161.html	2024-12-23T23:56:04-08:00	
Amicorp Group to dispute $1 billion legal claim by Malaysia's 1MDB for alleged fraud	KUALA LUMPUR — Amicorp Group has said it will dispute a claim for more than $1 billion filed by scandal-hit Malaysian fund 1MDB, denying allegations it knowingly facilitated more than $7 billion in fraudulent transactions related to the misappropriation of 1MDB funds. Corporate services provider Amicorp, in a statement late Monday, said it would defend itself and challenge the effort by sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, which filed a legal claim last week in the British Virgin Islands. 1MDB has alleged Hong Kong-headquartered Amicorp and its CEO played a vital role in enabling the Malaysian fund to be defrauded between 2009 and 2014. The claim is one of the biggest filed by 1MDB related to the multibillion-dollar graft scandal. Malaysian and U.S. investigators have previously estimated $4.5 billion was siphoned away from 1MDB in a complex, globe-spanning scheme that implicated former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman Sachs staff and high-level officials elsewhere. 1MDB alleges Amicorp created and managed a complex conspiracy consisting of layers of shell companies, sham transactions, and fraudulent financial structures that obscured the true origin and destination of the funds. But Amicorp said the misappropriated 1MDB funds were 'ill-gotten by or for the benefit' of Malaysian senior government officials and the top senior management of Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co and its unit Aabar Investments PJS. The two UAE firms agreed in 2023 to pay $1.8 billion to Malaysia to settle a legal dispute over the 1MDB scandal. Najib, who helped found 1MDB in 2009, is currently in prison for corruption and money laundering for receiving about $10 million from former 1MDB unit SRC International and has consistently denied wrongdoing. Najib's 12-year prison sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's former king, but he faces several other graft trials related to 1MDB. Amicorp said it has not been the subject of any administrative investigations or party to any civil suits, and has cooperated with Singapore and Swiss government agencies and criminal prosecutors based on 'mutual assistance' in criminal matters. It did not provide further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amicorp-group-to-dispute-1-billion-legal-claim-by-malaysia-s-1mdb-for-alleged-fraud-/7912158.html	2024-12-23T23:47:16-08:00	
Hong Kong offers bounties for six more democrats in security squeeze	HONG KONG — Hong Kong on Tuesday imposed bounties of HK$1 million, or $128,728, on six more pro-democracy campaigners deemed to have violated national security laws, and revoked the passports of seven others, in a continuing security squeeze in the financial hub. Hong Kong's Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the six -- all based overseas in countries including Britain and the United States -- had engaged in the alleged crimes of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The six included UK-based commentator Chung Kim-wah, former head of a pro-independence group Tony Chung, and Carmen Lau, a member of the Hong Kong Democracy Council. '(I) will not back down only because of an arrest warrant and a bounty. And I hope to have every one of you standing with me in this fight for Hong Kong,' wrote Lau on Twitter. The move to add more names to Hong Kong's wanted list comes as the city strives to revive its economic growth and international reputation after a years-long crackdown on dissent that has drawn global criticism. China and Hong Kong authorities have defended the clampdown under sweeping national security laws, saying stability has been restored after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019. Tang said the six pro-democracy campaigners had engaged in activities including giving speeches, social media posts and lobbying for Hong Kong officials and judges to be sanctioned by foreign governments, thus endangering national security. China's office for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong said in a statement it supported the actions because these individuals had engaged in 'anti-China' and destabilizing acts. Others were deemed to have advocated Hong Kong's independence from China. Hong Kong, a former British colony for over 150 years, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 'Instead of celebrating Xmas, it (Hong Kong) is taking a major step to escalate its transnational repression campaign,' wrote Anna Kwok, a U.S. based Hong Kong activist. There are now a total of 19 opposition figures on the city's wanted list including lawyers Kevin Yam and Dennis Kwok, former lawmaker Ted Hui and activists Nathan Law and Joey Siu. Hui had $100,000 of his money confiscated from an unspecified bank in the city, Tang said. Notices bearing black and white photographs of the 'fugitives' have been posted in public including at Hong Kong's international airport. Seven 'absconders,' including Hui, who are now based overseas, also had their passports revoked under a fresh set of national security laws known as Article 23, enacted this year. 'They will become someone without an identity,' Tang told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-offers-bounties-for-six-more-democrats-in-security-squeeze/7912151.html	2024-12-23T23:16:23-08:00	
Israeli intercepts missile from Yemen, warns of ‘severe blow’ to Houthi militants	Israel’s military said early Tuesday it intercepted a missile that was launched from Yemen. The missile prompted air sirens, but caused no damage after being destroyed before entering Israeli territory, the military said. The Yemen-based Houthi militants have fired scores of missiles at Israel since Hamas launched its attack on Israel in October 2023, sparking the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s response has included airstrikes on Houthi targets, and on Monday Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Houthi leaders would face the fate as leaders from Hamas and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group who have been killed in Israeli strikes. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are all backed by Iran, and all have been designated as terror groups by the United States and others. Katz on Monday confirmed Israel was responsible for the August explosion in Tehran that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Israel was widely believed to have been behind the attack, but Monday’s comments appeared to be Israel’s first public acknowledgment. Israeli forces killed a number of Hezbollah leaders in recent months amid intensified fighting in southern and eastern Lebanon. That conflict has cooled with a month-old cease-fire, while negotiators including Egypt, the United States and Qatar have been working to try to achieve an elusive halt in fighting in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Monday in the Knesset that there has been 'some progress' in the ongoing negotiations to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. 'Everything we are doing cannot be disclosed,' Netanyahu said. 'I wish to say cautiously that there has been some progress and we will not stop acting until we bring them all home.' Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,200 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Netanyahu also said Monday that he wants to sign new peace agreements with Arab countries, similar to the 2020 Abraham Accords negotiated by the U.S. for Israel and several Arab countries. 'Moderate Arab countries view Israel as a regional power and a potential ally,' Netanyahu said. 'I intend to seize this opportunity to the fullest.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-intercepts-missile-from-yemen-warns-of-severe-blow-to-houthi-militants/7912133.html	2024-12-23T21:25:27-08:00	
Report: Panel unable to reach consensus on Nippon's US Steel bid	tokyo — The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has told the White House it is unable to reach a consensus on national security risks involved in Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, The Washington Post reported Monday. The decision now lies with President Joe Biden, who has 15 days to act. Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have said they oppose the $15 billion deal, which Nippon Steel announced last December. Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it did not receive any updates from CFIUS. U.S. Steel did not immediately reply to request for a comment. Both companies had previously planned to close the deal before the year's end. CFIUS, a government interagency committee that reviews security implications of foreign investment in the United States, said Monday that allowing Nippon Steel to take over U.S. Steel could result in lower domestic steel production, representing 'a national security risk,' according to the Post. Nippon Steel said it could eliminate that risk by appointing U.S. citizens to top management and board of director positions at U.S. Steel, but the committee was divided in its view of whether those remedies would be sufficient, the newspaper said. The U.S. Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS; the Commerce Department; and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nippon Steel faces a $565 million penalty to U.S. Steel if the deal collapses, which would also be a major blow to the Japanese steelmaker's overseas expansion. It said earlier that it could pursue legal action against the U.S. government if the deal fell apart. With U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel aimed to raise its global steel production capacity to 85 million metric tons per year from 65 million tons now, and the asset is core to its goal of lifting production capacity to more than 100 million tons in the long term. With Japan being the largest foreign investor in the U.S., Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last month sent a letter to Biden asking him to approve Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-panel-unable-to-reach-consensus-on-nippon-s-us-steel-bid/7912095.html	2024-12-23T18:56:13-08:00	
El Salvador lawmakers overturn mining ban in win for president	SAN SALVADOR, El salvador — El Salvador's legislature overturned a seven-year-old ban on metals mining Monday, a move that President Nayib Bukele had pushed for to boost economic growth, but that environmental groups had opposed. El Salvador in 2017 became the first country in the world to ban all forms of metals mining. Bukele, who took office in 2019, has called the ban absurd. All 57 of Bukele's allies in the Central American country's 60-seat legislature voted for the president's legislation to overturn the ban. The legislation will grant the Salvadoran government sole authority over mining activities within the country's land and maritime territory. 'By creating a law that puts the state at the center, we are guaranteeing that the population's well-being will be at the center of decision-making,' lawmaker Elisa Rosales, from Bukele's New Ideas party, said in a speech to the legislature. The legislation does prohibit the use of mercury in mining and seeks to declare some areas incompatible with metals mining as protected nature reserves. El Salvador's economy is expected to grow 3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, but it has a heavy debt burden that hit a level of around 85% of gross domestic product earlier this year. Bukele, who enjoys wide popularity among voters after a gang crackdown, has touted mining's economic potential for the country of roughly 6 million people. The president shared on social media last month that studies conducted in just 4% of Salvadoran territory where mining is possible had identified gold deposits worth $132 billion, equivalent to about 380% of El Salvador's gross domestic product. 'This wealth, given by God, can be harnessed responsibly to bring unprecedented economic and social development to our people,' Bukele wrote at the time. Dozens of people protested Monday near Congress against the reauthorization of mining, arguing that future projects could affect the communities and ecosystem of the smallest country in Central America. 'We oppose metals mining because it has been technically and scientifically proven that mining is not viable in the country,' environmentalist Luis Gonzalez told reporters. 'The level of contamination that would be generated in the water, soil and biodiversity is unacceptable for life as we know it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-lawmakers-overturn-mining-ban-in-win-for-president-/7912091.html	2024-12-23T18:41:12-08:00	
Videos appear to show 2 of 4 missing Ecuadorian kids taken by men in military uniform	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa on Monday pledged that his government would not cover up for anyone involved in the disappearance of four children who were last seen running away from a military convoy this month. The statement came as Noboa's government, which has leaned on the armed forces to try to rein in soaring crime, is under pressure from human rights organizations and fellow Ecuadorians over the case. Dozens of people demonstrated Monday in Guayaquil, where the children ages 11 to 15 went missing December 8, demanding information about their whereabouts and asking that the case be investigated as a forced disappearance. Meanwhile, surveillance videos have emerged from Guayaquil, showing men in military uniform grabbing two boys and driving off with them. The two are believed to be among the four children who disappeared that night. Ecuador's defense minister, Gian Carlo Loffredo, on Monday confirmed the four were detained in the area where the footage was taken. The Associated Press on Monday reviewed the videos, including those from a security camera at an intersection across from a public hospital near the Las Malvinas neighborhood, where the missing children lived. The videos were handed over by a city contractor to the attorney general's office, the anti-kidnapping unit of the National Police and the National Assembly. The videos show a group of children running, men in uniform, two children being placed in the back of a pickup truck and the vehicle moving through the streets of Guayaquil. The footage appears to back up the account of the father of two of the children given to local media. In related developments, the attorney general's office, in response to questions from the AP, confirmed that authorities raided an air force base on the outskirts of Guayaquil early Monday. The raid seized two white vans and the cellphones of 16 soldiers who carried out an unspecified operation the day the children went missing, according to the authorities. In the videos seen by the AP, two boys — one in a blue shirt and the other in an orange shirt — are taken by the uniformed men, placed face down in the back of a white pickup truck with tinted windows. One of the children is then punched in the head. The vehicle has a flashing siren, no license plate and a black bench in the back, similar to those used in military patrols. The men in the video are armed and in camouflage uniforms with badges resembling those of the Ecuadorian Air Force. Luis Arroyo, the father of two of the missing children, earlier told local media his children were on their way home after playing soccer when two vehicles carrying people in military uniforms arrived in the area. The children, he said, were chased, and four were caught and driven away. It wasn't clear how he knew this. Part of the footage shows 11 children near an overpass. A while later, some children are seen running and two of them get stopped, one by a person in uniform and the other by a civilian. The two are the ones later being pushed into the back of the pickup truck. Loffredo, the defense minister, told reporters Monday that according to a military report, the children were detained by a patrol with 16 agents who 'observed eight people who were allegedly robbing a woman.' He said the military later released the minors and did not hand them over to the police. The footage reviewed by the AP does not show the alleged robbery. Noboa told the local Radio Democracy station that it was still premature to classify the children's absence as a forced disappearance. 'We are on the side of justice, and whether it was a civilian, a priest, a policeman, a soldier who was involved, at the end of the day, people need answers,' said Noboa, who is seeking reelection in February. 'We are not going to cover up for anyone.' Fernando Bastias, a member of Ecuador's Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, an NGO, said the disappearances constitute 'a serious violation of human rights' and called for the prosecution of any military personnel involved.	https://www.voanews.com/a/videos-appear-to-show-2-of-4-missing-ecuadorian-kids-taken-by-men-in-military-uniform/7912073.html	2024-12-23T17:30:51-08:00	
Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupts, spewing columns of lava	LOS ANGELES — One of the world's most active volcanoes sprang into life again Monday, spewing columns of lava 80 meters above Hawaii, U.S. vulcanologists said. Images showed enormous fissures in the caldera of Kilauea, on Hawaii's Big Island, spraying jets of molten rock into the air. The U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the eruption began just after 2 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) in the southwestern section of the caldera. 'At 4:30 a.m., lava fountains were observed with heights up to 80 meters [262 feet],' the agency said. 'Molten material, including lava bombs, is being ejected from the winds on the caldera floor up onto the west caldera rim.' The eruption was also sending matter much higher into the atmosphere. 'The plume of volcanic gas and fine volcanic particles is reaching elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level ... and winds are transporting it to the southwest,' the observatory said. The observatory said sulfur dioxide emanating from the fissure would react with other gases in the atmosphere. So-called vog — volcanic smog — can affect people and animals, as well as crops. Kilauea has been very active since 1983 and erupts relatively regularly, including most recently in September. It is one of six active volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, which include Mauna Loa, the largest volcano in the world, though Kilauea is far more active.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hawaii-s-kilauea-volcano-erupts-spewing-columns-of-lava-/7912065.html	2024-12-23T17:14:25-08:00	
Holy Year about to start in Rome	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Tuesday formally inaugurates the 2025 Holy Year, reviving an ancient church tradition encouraging the faithful to make pilgrimages to Rome, amid new security fears following a Christmas market attack in Germany. At the start of Christmas Eve Mass, Francis will push open the Holy Door on St. Peter's Basilica, which will stay open throughout the year to allow the estimated 32 million pilgrims projected to visit Rome to pass through. The first Holy Year was called in 1300, and in recent times they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — the centuries-old feature of the Catholic Church related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church's third millennium. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy and the next one planned is in 2033, to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. What are indulgences? According to church teaching, Catholics who confess their sins are forgiven and therefore released from the eternal or spiritual punishment of damnation. An indulgence is designed to remove the 'temporal' punishment of sin that may remain — the consequence of the wrongdoing that might disrupt the sinner's relationships with others. Martin Luther's opposition to the church's practice of selling indulgences inspired him to launch the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s. He was excommunicated, and the practice of buying and selling indulgences has been illegal since the 1562 Council of Trent. But the granting of them has continued and is an important element in Holy Year pilgrimages. According to the norms issued for the 2025 Jubilee, Catholics can obtain an indulgence if they: Undertake a pious pilgrimage, participating in Masses and other sacraments, at any of the four papal basilicas in Rome or the Holy Land, or other sacred Jubilee sites 'so as to manifest the great need for conversion and reconciliation.' Participate in works of charity, mercy or penance, such as visiting prisoners, sick people or elderly people or undertaking corporal works of mercy 'to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, welcome the stranger, heal the sick, visit the imprisoned and bury the dead.' Abstain, in a spirit of penance, for at least one day of the week from 'futile distractions,' such as social media, or from 'superfluous consumption,' such as fasting; or donating a proportionate sum to the poor or to help migrants. Why the focus on prisoners? Francis has long made ministry to prisoners a hallmark of his priestly vocation, and a Holy Year dedicated to a message of hope is no exception. In fact, the only other Holy Door that Francis will personally open this year is located at the chapel of Rome's Rebibbia prison, to draw attention to the need to give prisoners in particular hope of a better future. The final big event of the Holy Year before it closes on January 6, 2026, is the Jubilee of Prisoners on December 14, 2025. What's on the calendar? The Jubilee calendar is a compilation of official and unofficial Holy Year events that will test the stamina of Francis, who just turned 88 and went into the Christmas season with a cold that made it hard for him to catch his breath. Every month has two, three or four official Jubilee events that Francis is expected to attend that are designated for particular categories of people: the armed forces, artists, priests, poor people, volunteers and teachers. Then there are the unofficial Jubilee events, in which individual dioceses and other groups have organized their own pilgrimages to Rome. One item on the Jubilee's unofficial calendar, September 6, has made news because it has been organized by an Italian association, 'La Tenda di Gionata' or 'Jonathan's Tent,' which is dedicated to making LGBTQ+ Catholics feel more welcome in the Catholic Church. What about security for so many people? Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has said the security plans call for a mix of traditional policing — a reported 700 extra officers — plus high-tech surveillance using drones and closed-circuit cameras that, thanks to algorithms informed by artificial intelligence, can keep track in real time of crowd sizes and congestion points. 'There will be more vehicles, more men, and very, very, shall we say, robust and important security devices,' Gualtieri told reporters last week. The Vatican has tried to reduce congestion for pilgrims by allowing them to reserve their visits to St. Peter's Basilica online in advance. After a driver plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people, Italian authorities last week sent a circular to police stations around the country recommending 'maximum' investigative efforts and to immediately boost surveillance and police patrols around Christmas markets and displays and tourist attractions. The Vatican, with its life-sized creche and giant Christmas tree in St. Peter's Square and outdoor exhibit of nativity scenes in the Bernini colonnade ringing it, qualifies as an at-risk target. How else is Rome preparing? Rome has had two years of intense preparations for the Holy Year that involved major public works projects and artistic renovations that have coincided with separate initiatives paid for by the European Union's COVID-19 recovery funds. Fewer than a third of the 323 Jubilee projects have been finished or will wrap up by next month, meaning traffic headaches and eyesores will continue well into 2025 and even 2026. But Romans and visitors are beginning to see some of the finished products. Bernini's fountains in Piazza Navona are glistening white again after a monthslong cleaning. A spiffed-up Trevi Fountain reopened over the weekend, and on Monday the main Jubilee project was unveiled: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square.	https://www.voanews.com/a/holy-year-about-to-start-in-rome/7911812.html	2024-12-23T16:11:05-08:00

MSF: South Sudan 'overwhelmed' by refugee influx and cholera outbreaks	Nairobi, Kenya — South Sudan is facing a 'completely overwhelming' influx of refugees from war-torn Sudan as well as a rapidly growing cholera epidemic, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned Monday. The medical charity said up to 5,000 people were crossing the border every day. The United Nations recently put the figure even higher at 7,000 to 10,000 a day. Sudan is suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian emergencies since conflict broke out between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April 2023, with tens of thousands killed and millions displaced. An MSF emergency coordinator in Renk town, near a transit center holding some 17,000 people, according to the U.N., said they were working with the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide care. 'But the situation is completely overwhelming, and it's not enough,' said Emanuele Montobbio. Facilities are expanding, but 'over 100 wounded patients, many with serious injuries, still await surgery,' he said. Alhida Hammed fled to Renk after his village was attacked, and he was shot in Sudan's Blue Nile state. 'The houses were blazing, and everyone was running in different directions,' he said. He now has no shelter and is living under a tree but does not want to return to Sudan. 'Home is no longer a home. It is filled with bad memories,' he said. 'Death's door' South Sudan is ill-equipped to handle the arrival of thousands seeking shelter from war, with the young country itself battling violence, endemic poverty and natural disasters. Huge numbers of its own citizens are living in camps for internally displaced people, and many now face an 'alarming and rapid increase' in cholera cases, MSF said. It said 92 people had died following an outbreak in Unity state, and that it had treated over 1,210 people in just four weeks in Bentiu city. In sprawling camps near the capital, Juba, home to tens of thousands, MSF said it had treated some 1,700 suspected cases, with 25 deaths reported by the community. 'What we are witnessing is not just a cholera outbreak — it is the result of systemic neglect,' said MSF's South Sudan head of mission Mamman Mustapha. He described 'mountains of uncollected waste,' broken latrines and raw sewage in the camps, leaving behind a legacy of contaminated drinking water and infected inhabitants at 'death's door.' Without immediate action, Mustapha said, 'we expect cholera cases to skyrocket in the coming days and weeks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/msf-south-sudan-overwhelmed-by-refugee-influx-and-cholera-outbreaks/7911800.html	2024-12-23T15:42:28-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: 2024 was 'roller coaster' year for China's stock market	China's stock market has experienced a tumultuous year. As 2024 draws to a close, the Chinese government has rolled out a series of fiscal incentives, including implementing a moderately loose monetary policy. Analysts believe these measures indicate significant downward pressure on the Chinese economy. Analysts say that while the stock market may see a 'slow bull' trend due to ongoing interest rate cuts, in the long term there are still no clear signs of substantial recovery for China's overall economy.

Going home? Syrians in Europe are not so sure	Orleans, France — Nabil Attar sprinkles sesame and pomegranate over creamy mutabal, a roasted eggplant dip from his native Syria — one of his mother's many recipes now featured at his restaurant, Narenj. A plate of stuffed grape leaves sits nearby, ready for the swelling lunchtime crowd. The tiny kitchen where he works seems an unlikely place for Attar, once a successful Damascus businessman specializing in electronic fund transfers. That was before Bashar al-Assad's regime kidnapped one of his sons, nearly a decade ago. 'It was so complicated,' recalled Attar, describing extortive practices wielded by the state to fill its coffers. 'I paid a lot of money to get my son back.' In 2015, Attar and his family joined the hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing their war-torn country for Europe. He settled in the Loire Valley city of Orleans, an hour's train ride from Paris and best known for its historical ties to France's patron saint Joan of Arc. Then came news earlier in December that the Assad era was over. 'I never imagined in my lifetime it could happen,' Attar said, scrolling through videos of himself and fellow Syrians in Orleans, rejoicing in the dictator's downfall. 'Now Syria is free.' For a growing number of European Union countries, Assad's ouster is triggering more than celebrations. Amid growing anti-immigration sentiment across the region, several have suspended Syrian asylum claims on grounds that the reasons that triggered them no longer exist. That's the case of Germany, which took in nearly a million Syrian asylum-seekers at the peak of the refugee influx, in 2015-16. While Chancellor Olaf Scholz says those 'integrated' were welcome, one opposition Christian Democratic Union lawmaker suggested paying Syrians roughly $1,040 apiece to go home — a position already adopted by neighboring Austria. Hardening attitudes are also evident in France, despite its having only about 30,000 Syrian refugees. A CSA poll this month found 70% of French supported suspending new asylum claims. French authorities say they are studying the matter. 'Since we hear that Syrian refugees are rejoicing in the fall of dictator Assad, let's engage in sending them home,' Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally, told a cheering crowd recently. 'And let's hope Europe shuts the door after they leave.' For Syria's diaspora in Europe and rights advocates, the vanishing welcome mat is triggering alarm. In interviews across the region, many refugees say they fear returning. 'The situation in Syria is extremely volatile, extremely unpredictable,' said Olivia Sundberg Diez, the European Union migration and asylum advocate for Amnesty International. 'What is most important should be the safety of Syrian refugees and people that are seeking protection — this has to be prioritized over political interests.' 'Rushing the return of millions of Syrians would put even more pressure on Syria at an extremely fragile moment and would undermine the prospect of a successful transition,' warned Will Todman, deputy director and a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research group, in a commentary. The debate is echoed among the Syrian community around Orleans. 'I'm worried about the country, I'm worried about the future,' said Ramez Ghadri, a Syrian gynecologist who settled in France decades ago. Of Syria's new leaders, he added, 'they're extremists.' Ehad Naily, a Syrian rights lawyer living outside the city, is also concerned. Like Attar, he arrived in France in 2015 and set up a local association to support fellow refugees. 'You can't say 'the regime is destroyed, you can now live in Syria,'' Naily said, describing shattered infrastructure and towns, and a tangle of religious and ethnic tensions simmering in his homeland. After nearly a decade living in France, his 15-year-old daughter does not speak Arabic. 'You can't force people to leave host countries if there's no stability there,' he said. Attar is more optimistic about Syria's near future. 'I believe that Syria will be better — much, much better than before,' he said. Like other Syrians here, he described Orleans residents as welcoming the newcomers. His older son, who was kidnapped, is now a pilot. His youngest is still in school. 'We never had any problem' in France, Attar said. After receiving asylum, he learned how to run a restaurant. In 2018, he and his wife opened Narenj, which means 'bitter orange' in Arabic. 'He's well-known here. He's got lots of loyal customers,' said Sophie Martinet, Attar's former French teacher who has now become a friend. 'He's undeniably talented. And people like Nabil.' Throughout the years, however, Assad's secret service kept tabs on him, Attar said, demanding money to leave him alone. 'This regime, they keep tracking everyone,' he said. 'It was a business, a network. It was organized crime.' Now a French citizen, Attar doesn't have worry about being sent back to Syria. But he believes other refugees here with legitimate reasons to stay in France have nothing to fear. 'People who are working, who are doing their best, who are well integrated in society — they will not be affected by what's happening in Syria,' he said. Attar himself is eager to return to a post-Assad Syria. 'I would like to go back, visit my family, my friends,' he said. 'See the streets where I worked, where I lived.' But not for good. Today, Attar said, his life and future are in France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/going-home-syrians-in-europe-are-not-so-sure/7911777.html	2024-12-23T15:32:59-08:00	
Over 200 killed in Haiti's Cite Soleil massacre, UN report finds	At least 207 people were killed by members of the Wharf Jeremie gang in Haiti's portside neighborhood of Cite Soleil earlier this month, the United Nations said in a report on Monday, revising a death toll it initially estimated at 187. In a new report on the massacre, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said at least 134 men and 73 women, most of them elderly residents accused of witchcraft, were killed in less than a week of mass executions, abductions and raids by some 300 members of the Wharf Jeremie gang. Gang leader Monel 'Mikano' Felix ordered the attacks after his child got sick, accusing local residents of causing the illness through Vodou. Many of the victims were abducted from Vodou temples and religious ceremonies, the U.N. said. The killings shocked the Caribbean nation, which has been engulfed in a worsening gang conflict, compounding devastating food shortages, while its neighbors lag on delivering long-promised security assistance. Felix's gang has controlled a small but strategic area between key ports, surrounding warehouses and national highways out of the capital for some 15 years, according to the U.N. After the killings, gang members attempted to erase evidence by confiscating mobile phones, burning bodies and dumping them into the sea. Over 5,300 people have been killed in Haiti since January and more than 12,000 since the start of 2022, according to the U.N., while over 700,000 have been internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-200-killed-in-haiti-s-cite-soleil-massacre-un-report-finds/7911790.html	2024-12-23T15:22:12-08:00

FAA probes holiday drone show accident that injured boy in Florida	ORLANDO — The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has launched an investigation into why several drones collided and fell from the sky during a holiday show over the weekend in downtown Orlando, Florida, injuring a 7-year-old boy who required surgery. The drones fell into a crowd of thousands of people watching the show Saturday night at the city's Lake Eola Park. The show was permitted through the FAA. 'Our thoughts are with the family and all those impacted by the outcome of this event,' the city of Orlando said in a statement. 'The city remains in contact with the vendor and FAA who will conduct a thorough investigation.' Adriana Edgerton told Orlando television station WESH that her son, Alexander, required surgery after being hit in the chest with a drone. 'The blade cut his mouth, but there's an actual imprint of the drone on his chest,' she said. Sky Elements Drone Shows, the Fort Worth, Texas, vendor that put on the show, didn't immediately respond to an emailed inquiry on Monday. On the company's website, it said, 'Every step of the way, we put accuracy, execution, and compliance first.' Drone shows typically require a waiver to operate more than one drone at a time, and the FAA reviews each drone show application to make sure 'the flying public and people on the ground will be safe,' the agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/faa-probes-holiday-drone-show-accident-that-injured-boy-in-florida-/7911775.html	2024-12-23T14:56:18-08:00	
Botswana issues 400 elephant hunting licenses, drawing fresh opposition	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana has issued 400 elephant hunting licenses amid fresh opposition from conservationists. International hunters pay up to $50,000 to obtain a license in order to hunt an elephant. In a recent notice from the Wildlife and National Parks department, the elephants are among other wildlife species that will be offered to hunters. Botswana’s hunting season runs from April to November, attracting enthusiasts from abroad. However, a group of local and international conservationists has petitioned Botswana’s new government, which came into power after the Oct. 30 general election, to stop the practice of trophy hunting. Oaitse Nawa of the nonprofit Elephant Protection Society is part of those petitioning the government against hunting the big game. He said the organization is surprised the government has released the hunting quota for the new season. 'We did a petition — the idea was to ask the government to take time, to stop the elephant quota in the meantime because there was not enough consultation regarding all the stakeholders,' Nawa said. 'For this quota to come out, it was a big surprise to us.' The government held a consultative meeting at the beginning of December to decide on the number of animals to put up for the shoot. Nawa said the group wants the new government to intervene and stop the hunts. 'It is a very big concern looking at the fact that hunting does not benefit the community,' he said. 'Anything that has to do with hunting has to be reviewed. Remember, we are still dealing with the old regime and we are not surprised to see them come up with these numbers.' The government said nearly $3 million was raised by communities in the previous hunting season, mainly from the sale of elephant licenses. Conservationists opposed to the hunts argue the targeting of male elephants disturbs the animals’ breeding patterns. The chief executive of the Botswana Wildlife Producers Association, Isaac Theophilus, backs hunting. 'The petition to government is unfortunate and misguided,' he said. 'Trophy hunting does not target prime breeding bulls. It is highly selective. It targets animals that are past their breeding prime. So it [hunting] will nowhere affect the breeding patterns.' Wildlife management expert biologist Dr. Erik Verreynne said hunting will not disturb elephant populations in Botswana. 'It is possible that hunting activity in an area can affect the movements of a breeding herd,' he said, 'but if we see it within the larger context of 400 bulls being hunted in a population of 130,000 to 140,000 elephants in Botswana, then it’s highly unlikely that we are going to see an impact on the breeding rate or population growth of elephants.' Botswana has the world’s largest elephant herd at more than 130,000. The country resumed trophy hunting activities in 2019 following a five-year moratorium. Botswana also has one of the world’s highest incidences of human-wildlife conflict, with the animals moving closer to human settlements in search of water and forage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-issues-400-elephant-hunting-licenses-drawing-fresh-opposition-/7911746.html	2024-12-23T14:14:16-08:00	
Canada records 50,000 opioid overdose deaths since 2016	OTTAWA, CANADA — Nearly 50,000 people in Canada died of an apparent opioid overdose from January 2016 to June 2024, with fentanyl playing an increasingly prominent role in fatalities, the national health agency said Monday. The prevalence of fentanyl in Canada has drawn additional attention after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump cited the drug as part of his justification to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Trump has accused Ottawa of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States and said his promised 25% tariff would remain in place until Canadian authorities address the problem. Health Canada on Monday reported a total of 49,105 'apparent opioid toxicity deaths' from the start of 2016 to June of this year. Fentanyl was involved in 79% of opioid deaths so far this year, a figure that has increased by 39% since 2016, the agency said. Canadian authorities have acknowledged a significant spike in domestic fentanyl production. The seizure of Canadian-made fentanyl in the United States, Australia and elsewhere indicates that domestic production exceeds demand, and Canada has become a net fentanyl exporter, the Foreign Ministry has said. But experts do not believe Canadian-sourced fentanyl is a major player in the United States. Health Canada said that so far this year, an average of 21 people have died each day from an apparent opioid overdose, 72% of whom were males. Those figures marked an improvement compared to the same period in 2023, Health Canada said, but noted the figures are preliminary and subject to change. 'We must remain cautious in drawing conclusions on the trends for 2024,' he said in a statement. 'The extent of opioid and stimulant-related harms remains very high.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-records-50-000-opioid-overdose-deaths-since-2016/7911744.html	2024-12-23T14:01:09-08:00

Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City celebrates its first-ever metro line	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Thousands of selfie-taking Ho Chi Minh City residents crammed into train carriages Sunday as the traffic-clogged business hub celebrated the opening of its first-ever metro line after years of delays. Huge queues spilled out of every station along the $1.7 billion line that runs almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city center — with women in traditional 'ao dai' dress, soldiers in uniform and couples clutching young children waiting excitedly to board. 'I know it (the project) is late, but I still feel so very honored and proud to be among the first on this metro,' said office worker Nguyen Nhu Huyen after snatching a selfie in her jam-packed train car. 'Our city is now on par with the other big cities of the world,' she said. It took 17 years for Vietnam's commercial capital to reach this point. The project, funded largely by Japanese government loans, was first approved in 2007 and slated to cost $668 million. When construction began in 2012, authorities promised the line would be up and running in five years. But as delays mounted, cars and motorbikes multiplied in the city of 9 million people, making the metropolis hugely congested, increasingly polluted and time-consuming to navigate. The metro 'meets the growing travel needs of residents and contributes to reducing traffic congestion and environmental pollution,' said the city's deputy mayor, Bui Xuan Cuong. Cuong admitted authorities had to overcome 'countless hurdles' to get the project over the line. According to state media reports, the metro was late because of 'slow capital disbursement, unexpected technical problems, personnel difficulties and the Covid-19 pandemic.' 'The delays and cost overruns have been frustrating,' professor Vu Minh Hoang said at Fulbright University Vietnam, who warned that with just 14 station stops, the line's 'impact in alleviating traffic will be limited in the short run.' However, it is still a 'historic achievement for the city's urban development,' he added. With lessons learned, 'the construction of future lines will be increasingly easier, faster and more cost-efficient,' Hoang told AFP. Back on the train, 84-year-old war veteran Vu Thanh told AFP he was happy to experience below ground in a more positive way after spending three years fighting American troops in the city's famous Cu Chi tunnels, an enormous underground network. 'It feels so different from the underground experience I had years ago during the war. It's so bright and nice here,' he said. Reflecting on the delays, he added: 'We built the tunnels to hide from our enemies in the past, so building a tunnel for a train should not be that hard,' he added. 'Finally, we made it!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-ho-chi-minh-city-celebrates-its-first-ever-metro-line-/7911715.html	2024-12-23T13:25:36-08:00	
US ship departs Cambodia after first port visit in nearly a decade	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The USS Savannah departed from Cambodia last Friday, after the first port visit by the U.S. Navy to the Southeast Asian nation in eight years. Despite being a close partner of China, analysts say the stop in Cambodia’s port city of Sihanoukville shows that the country is looking to improve its relations with the United States. The Savannah arrived in Sihanoukville last Monday and docked there about 30 kilometers from the Chinese-funded Ream Naval Base, which has drawn concern from U.S. analysts as a potential permanent base for Chinese forces. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense says the U.S. warship’s five-day visit was aimed at 'strengthening and expanding friendship' and 'promoting bilateral cooperation.' In June 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Minister of National Defense Tea Seiha, with the two sides agreeing to strengthen their bilateral defense relationship. Recent anti-democratic reforms, human rights violations and an increasing Chinese presence within Cambodia have strained relations. The Ream Naval Base is a particular sore spot for the two nations, with the U.S. imposing sanctions in 2021 on two senior Cambodian military officials accused of profiting from the Chinese-built base. However, last week’s port call and official promises suggest that Cambodia wishes to push back against its reputation as a client state of Beijing, analysts say. 'I think that Cambodians are trying to show that — look, we’re not taking the side of the Chinese or the Americans,' said Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a researcher at the Lowy Institute in Australia. Yaacob said that Cambodia is using the return of a U.S. defense presence to its shores to demonstrate its adherence to self-proclaimed principles of nonalignment to the broader Asian region. Sam Seun, a policy analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told VOA that the international community too often focuses on Cambodia’s relationship with China, and that this port call proves Cambodia can have good relationships with the United States and other countries too. He said China’s presence in Cambodia’s defense infrastructure is normal for a small country looking to 'strengthen its military capabilities.' One port call, though, might not be enough to quell U.S. fears about Chinese military influence in Cambodia and mend the U.S.-Cambodian relationship. Although he viewed it as a 'good start,' the warship docking in Cambodia 'will not lead to a full restoration of relations between Cambodia and the United States. The United States will still accuse Cambodia of allowing China to establish a military base in its territory,' Seun said. China's two Type 056A frigates, the Aba and the Tianmen, had been stationed at Ream Naval Base for nearly 12 months by the time the Savannah arrived in Cambodia. Cambodian officials earlier stated that the ships were there for training engagements with the Cambodian navy. The base’s location holds strategic significance to China, given its proximity to potential conflict arenas and vital shipping routes in the South China Sea, said Sun Kim, assistant dean and lecturer at the Faculty of Social Sciences and International Relations at the Pannasastra University of Cambodia. Sun said the base is important to Chinese oil and gas transportation, as it allows for a greater ease of transport of fuel from Africa and the Middle East. Additionally, in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait, Ream Base could prove even more important, analysts say. 'If China needs to deploy its navy, Ream Naval Base may be used as one of the bases for deployment by China,' said Sun. However, according to Cambodian law, foreign forces are prohibited from being permanently stationed in the country and from conducting military operations out of Cambodian bases. Cambodia has denied that the Ream Naval Base is controlled by China. On Friday, Cambodia’s former Prime Minister Hun Sen said Japan would be granted visitation rights to Ream Naval Base, according to a post on his Facebook page. The announcement came during a visit to Cambodia by Japan national security adviser Akiba Takeo.

Azerbaijani journalist says he was jailed over his work	WASHINGTON — A journalist jailed in Azerbaijan for nearly seven months has said he believes his arrest is linked to his reporting. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has been jailed since May on charges including conspiring to smuggle foreign currency. The journalist, his employer and press freedom groups believe the case is retaliatory and part of a wider crackdown in Azerbaijan. In messages relayed to VOA through his wife, Mehralizada spoke about his passion for journalism and said he believed he was targeted for his work. 'I’ve always enjoyed working with statistical data and numbers. As a journalist and economist, it was my job to interpret them,' Mehralizada said. Mehralizada says he believes he is being detained in retaliation for his work, which is often critical of the government’s economic policy. 'I think my arrest highlighted how authoritarian governments, like Azerbaijan’s, fear the power of numbers and the reality they reveal through statistics,' Mehralizada said. Among the journalist’s criticisms was that the Azerbaijani government isn’t diversifying the economy’s reliance on oil and gas. Mehralizada is one of at least 14 journalists jailed in the past year for their work in Azerbaijan, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Several of them work at Abzas Media, one of the country’s most prominent anti-corruption investigative outlets. Mehralizada did not work with Abzas Media but he sometimes provided expert commentary to the outlet. Still, he is facing charges of 'conspiring to smuggle foreign currency' in connection to a case brought against Abzas Media. Mehralizada denies the charge. Mehralizada and Abzas Media have both said that he never worked for the outlet. Mehralizada is facing additional charges of 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He faces up to 12 years behind bars if convicted of all the charges against him. He denies the accusations. A trial against Mehralizada and six Abzas Media staffers began on Dec. 17 in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. Press freedom groups say the charges against the group of journalists are politically motivated. The trial 'epitomizes the way the Azerbaijani government has used retaliatory criminal charges to lock up vast swathes of the country’s leading independent journalists over the past year,' Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement. RFE/RL has condemned the trial and called for Mehralizada’s immediate release. 'Farid is being punished for reporting uncomfortable truths about Azerbaijan’s economy. Azerbaijan must end this sham trial and release Farid to his wife and newborn daughter,' RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement last week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also called for the release of Mehralizada and other journalists jailed in Azerbaijan. 'The United States is deeply concerned not only by these detentions, but by the increasing crackdown on civil society and media in Azerbaijan,' Blinken said in a statement earlier in December. Azerbaijan’s Washington embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment. When the trial began, Mehralizada’s wife, Nargiz Mukhtarova, said it was difficult to see her husband and the other defendants in handcuffs. 'But their courage was incredibly impressive,' she told VOA. 'They were smiling during [the] hearing.' In prison, Mukhtarova said, her husband spends his days reading books — nearly 200 of them since he was detained — and doing crossword puzzles. He is being treated well, but without internet access, he 'mostly suffers' from a lack of economic news, Mukhtarova added. Mukhtarova and her husband are permitted one weekly meeting, which she said they always look forward to. 'He is doing good,' she said. 'His mood is better now because at least they have a chance to talk publicly about their case.' The trial is set to resume on Dec. 28.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijani-journalist-says-he-was-jailed-over-his-work/7911687.html	2024-12-23T13:11:40-08:00	
Experts urge US to use Taiwan logistics pact to counter China's military coercion	WASHINGTON — A recently released U.S. government report details China's ongoing efforts to 'erode long-standing norms in and around Taiwan' through various pressure tactics, including increased military flights crossing the Taiwan Strait median line. While U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns, some military experts argue that Washington's response has been ineffective in curbing Chinese aggression. To deter further coercion, some former U.S. military officials propose leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) to allow American military jets to refuel there as a clear demonstration of resolve. The ACSA, a rarely discussed logistics agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, allows the U.S. Department of Defense to exchange supplies, services, and logistical support with its partners and allies. In its 2024 report, Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China, released last week as mandated by Congress, the Pentagon highlights China's ongoing military buildup to secure national interests and assert territorial claims along its periphery. The report notes that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is increasingly focused on 'military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait while simultaneously delaying or denying third-party intervention.' The report also details the PLA's extensive joint land, air and sea exercises around Taiwan throughout 2023 to enhance combat readiness and operational coordination. It notes that more than 1,500 PLA aircraft entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone in both 2022 and 2023. Officials in Washington say U.S. defense engagement with Taiwan has evolved in response to China's growing capacity and willingness to use military coercion against Taiwan. But in Beijing, officials are warning against what they call 'foreign military intervention,' asserting that Taiwan is part of China's 'internal affairs.' 'China urges the U.S. to immediately stop arming Taiwan,' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Monday, following President Joe Biden's recent authorization of up to $571 million in Defense Department materials, services, and military training for the self-ruled island. The spokesperson condemned the U.S. announcement of military aid, warning that Washington is 'playing with fire' and will get 'burned.' Founded in 1949, the Communist Party-led People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. It has never excluded the possibility of using force to bring the island under its control. The U.S. maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity, taking neither an official stance on Taiwan's sovereignty nor supporting its independence. A State Department spokesperson recently said that the U.S. remains concerned about 'elevated' PLA activity near Taiwan, describing it as consistent with levels observed during previous 'Joint Sword' military exercises. The statement followed PLA naval drills near Taiwan and along the First Island Chain earlier in December. Trey Meeks, a senior defense fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, told VOA that low-cost strategies that would boost Taiwan's morale and demonstrate U.S. resolve could help counter China's 'new normal' of constant and escalated military coercion. Meeks is among the military experts who said President-elect Donald Trump’s team is likely to be much more aggressive only if Taiwan agrees to significantly increase its defense budget. When Chinese military jets cross the median line, he suggested, a pair of U.S. fighter jets could later respond by leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan logistics agreement, the ACSA, by making a refueling stop in Taiwan. Another U.S. option, Meeks said, would be a visit by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel already operating in the region. This would signify a strategic response and signal that larger ships, potentially including U.S. naval vessels, might follow at U.S.-Taiwanese discretion. It wouldn’t be the first time. In June 2021, a U.S. military aircraft traveled to Taiwan to deliver COVID-19 vaccines, while in February 2023, South Korea's 'Black Eagles' aerobatic team made a refueling stop at Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung airport while en route to an air show in Australia. For Taiwan, other options include intercepting Chinese aircraft incursions using radar missile locks. 'The ride stops being fun for the Chinese fighter pilot when you lock him up with a surface-to-air missile,' said Meeks, who's also a former U.S. military official. Forty-five years ago, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which became law on April 10, 1979. TRA policies would provide Taiwan with defensive weapons. U.S. special operations forces have been operating in Taiwan since 2012, and several hundred U.S. troops are currently known to be serving as a training team on the ground in Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-urge-us-to-use-taiwan-logistics-pact-to-counter-china-s-military-coercion/7911644.html	2024-12-23T12:45:50-08:00	
France unveils new government with budget battle looming	PARIS — France unveiled a new government on Monday, composed of former ministers and senior civil servants that Prime Minister Francois Bayrou will hope can oversee the passage of a 2025 budget and avoid a collapse that would deepen the country's crisis. Eric Lombard, 66, the head of Caisse des Depots, the investment arm of the French government, became finance minister, working with Amelie de Montchalin as budget minister. Conservative Bruno Retailleau remained interior minister. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu also remained in post. Elisabeth Borne, who stepped down as prime minister in January, became education minister, while former interior minister Gerard Darmanin will lead the Justice Ministry. Bayrou has struggled for almost 10 days to put together a government as he looks to stave off potential no-confidence votes from the far right and left. He will need to begin work immediately on passing a 2025 budget bill after parliamentary pushback over the proposed legislation led to the toppling of his predecessor, former Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The names were read out by President Emmanuel Macron's chief of staff Alexis Kohler.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-unveils-new-government-with-budget-battle-looming/7911562.html	2024-12-23T11:47:22-08:00	
Women’s football on rise in Zambia	Lusaka — The international success of Zambian footballers Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji is inspiring girls and young women in Zambia to take up the sport. The success of the two stars and the Zambian national women’s team offers a beacon of hope for many girls in Zambia. Women's football has been on the rise in Zambia since 2016. The Zambia women’s national football program has three teams competing internationally and filling up stadiums with thousands of enthusiastic fans. The national women’s team, known as the Copper Queens, was the first landlocked country in Africa to qualify for a World Cup in 2023. The country also boasts of the two most highly paid female football players in the world, Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, both native Zambians now playing for teams in the United States. Football’s governing body, FIFA, recently named Banda its 2024 Women’s Footballer of the Year. Lilian Mwenda is the youngest member of the team at 15 years old. Initially, she said, her parents encouraged her to focus on education, but now they are behind her football dreams. 'They are supporting me very much, especially that I am [on] the national team now where there are a lot of big players. It makes me feel very happy. Even my young siblings are looking up to me. My inspiration is Cristiano Ronaldo, but I also look up to Barbra Banda and Kundananji because they inspire me. They always work hard and reach high levels,' said Mwenda. The growth of women ‘s football in Zambia has led to the rise of grassroots talent development across the country. Oliver Shalala Sepiso is one of the mentors of female footballers in Zambia. He founded the Elite Ladies Football Club, which has produced female football players for the national team as well as the Olympics. 'Young girls in Zambia have it tougher than their male counterparts in the sense that the economy is not one of the best in the world. It's clear that Zambia is quite talented, especially in terms of speed, in terms of stature, so they are able to play football or soccer. So. I am one of those that feels I have the knack and talent and skill and time, as well, to dedicate into trying to develop these young girls,' he said. In an exclusive interview with VOA in Lusaka, Copper Queens captain Banda said she is happy to see young girls looking up to her as a role model. 'Women’s football in Zambia has grown so big. That young child who’s looking up to me, I would say they should keep on chasing their dreams,' she said. Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has been a strong supporter of women’s football in the country. At a luncheon he hosted to honor the athletes in Lusaka on Friday, he reaffirmed his administration‘s support toward developing women's football. 'Let's not write off the young people. When we see them for the first time, we don’t like their faces. We write them off. No, let's give them a chance to prove themselves so they can be the next Barbras, Kundananjis,' he said. FIFA President Gianni Infantino reiterated the world body’s commitment to growing football in Zambia, especially women’s football, during his first visit to Zambia in June. Infantino said FIFA would invest in a training center and an academy to promote football talent and coaches in Zambia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-s-football-on-the-rise-in-zambia/7911391.html	2024-12-23T10:23:32-08:00	
Survivors and advocates reflect on lessons from the massive 2004 earthquake and tsunami	The magnitude 9 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami on Dec. 26, 2004, killed over 230,000 people in 15 countries.

Kenya records 7,000 cases of violence against women since September 2023	NAIROBI — Kenya’s security report this year has been dominated by the violence and killings of women and girls, with more than 7,100 cases of gender-based violence since September 2023. Included in that number are 100 documented cases of murder against women since August 2024. Sarah Wambui said she was attacked one morning by her husband of 20 years. 'He attacked me on Jan. 18, 2024,' she said. 'He stabbed me all over — 38 stabs from my face, the entire body, even my internal organs, my kidney and liver, were affected. I have been in hospital. I was discharged in August.' Speaking last week, Foreign Affairs Minister and acting Interior Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the number of incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, or SGBV, against women worries security officers. 'Nairobi County recorded the highest number of SGBV cases, while Samburu and Mandera counties had the lowest incidents,' Mudavadi said. 'There were 100 murders of women from August to November 2024. So far, the Directorate of Criminal Investigation has completed the investigations on these, and the majority are pending before court.' Two weeks ago, hundreds of people took to the streets in Kenya, demanding an end to the killings of women. The protest was dispersed by police using tear gas and making arrests. The response by police angered demonstrators, human rights groups, and women’s organizations. They accused authorities of not taking the attacks and killings of women seriously. Wambui’s accused attacker is out of prison and has been threatening to kill her, she said. The mother of two has been moving from one place to another to avoid him. 'Right now, my life is in danger,' she said. 'The perpetrator is out, and he has vowed he will finish me, and the case will be discarded. So I am actually in hiding.' Human rights researchers say patriarchal views and a lack of protection are some of the reasons behind the attacks on women and girls. Njoki Gachanja, a human rights defender, said the number of abused women may be higher than reported. 'Most of those numbers come from low-income areas where there is a lot of poverty and that is linked to a lot of violence. So, these numbers may sound staggering for people who are on the ground documenting these cases on a daily basis,' Gachanja said. 'We know that there are more people who have not been covered by those who made the headlines, and this is a catastrophe that must be addressed by the government.' According to the Gender Violence Recovery Centre, one in three Kenyan women has experienced sexual violence before the age of 18, and 38% of married women have experienced physical violence. The government has set up a security team to address attacks on women and ensure justice for the victims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-records-7-000-cases-of-violence-against-women-since-september-2023/7911373.html	2024-12-23T09:13:39-08:00	
Frozen India-China ties thawed in 2024	Ties between India and China witnessed a thaw in 2024, with both sides pulling back some troops from flashpoints along their border.

Analysts also believe the India-China rapprochement will not affect India’s strategic cooperation with the United States.

US House Ethics Committee expected to release long-anticipated Matt Gaetz report Monday	Washington — The U.S. House Ethics Committee is expected to release its long-awaited report Monday into former Representative Matt Gaetz, ending a yearslong investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct with minors and use of illicit drugs while the Florida Republican was in office. The anticipated release comes after at least one Republican joined all five Democrats on the panel earlier this month in a secret vote to release the report about their former colleague despite initial opposition from Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to publishing findings about a former member of Congress. While ethics reports have previously been released after a member's resignation, it is extremely rare. Gaetz has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, saying last week that he would have 'no opportunity to debate or rebut' the findings as a former member of the House. On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit seeking to block the report's release, saying it contains 'untruthful and defamatory information' that would 'significantly damage' his 'standing and reputation in the community.' Gaetz's complaint argues he's no longer under the committee's jurisdiction since he resigned from Congress. 'The Committee's position that it may nonetheless publish potentially defamatory findings about a private citizen over whom it claims no jurisdiction represents an unprecedented expansion of Congressional power that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,' Gaetz's lawyers wrote in their request for a temporary restraining order. The often secretive, bipartisan panel has investigated claims against Gaetz since 2021. However, its work became more urgent last month when President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz as his attorney general nominee. Gaetz resigned from Congress that same day, putting him outside the purview of the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction. But Democrats had pressed to make the report public even after Gaetz was no longer a member and had withdrawn as Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department. A vote on the House floor this month to force the report's release failed; all but one Republican voted against it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-ethics-committee-expected-to-release-long-anticipated-matt-gaetz-report-monday/7911195.html	2024-12-23T07:21:23-08:00	
Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder and other charges in United Healthcare CEO's death	New York — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare pleaded not guilty on Monday to murder and terror charges in a state case that will run parallel to his federal prosecution. Luigi Mangione, 26, was shackled and seated in a Manhattan court when he leaned over to a microphone to enter his plea. The Manhattan district attorney formally charged him last week with multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. His initial appearance in New York's state's trial court was preempted by federal prosecutors bringing their own charges over the shooting. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Authorities say Mangione gunned down Brian Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on the morning of Dec 4. Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald's after a five-day search, carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID, police said. He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives, according to federal prosecutors. At a news conference announcing the state charges last Tuesday, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg said the application of the terrorism law reflected the severity of a 'frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation.' 'In its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror,' he added. 'And we've seen that reaction.' Karen Friedman Agnifilo, an attorney for Mangione, has accused federal and state prosecutors of advancing conflicting legal theories. In federal court last week, she called their approach 'very confusing' and 'highly unusual.' Mangione is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried. Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania on Thursday and quickly rushed to New York City, where he was seen wearing an orange jumpsuit as he was led away from a helicopter by heavily armed police officers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Adams said he was hoping to send a message to the suspect: 'I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city — the city that the people of New York love,' the mayor told a local TV station. 'I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that.' An Ivy-league graduate from a prominent Maryland family, Mangione appeared to have cut himself off from family and friends in recent months. He posted frequently in online forums about his struggles with back pain. He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer. Thompson, a married father of two high-schoolers, had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. The killing has prompted some to voice their resentment at U.S. health insurers, with Mangione serving as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. It also has sent shockwaves through the corporate world, rattling executives who say they have received a spike in threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-to-state-murder-and-other-charges-in-united-healthcare-ceo-s-death-/7911177.html	2024-12-23T07:05:47-08:00

Bangladesh seeks extradition of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA — Bangladesh has sent a formal request to India to extradite ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August amid the student-led protests that ended her 15 years in power, the country's foreign affairs adviser said Monday. Md Touhid Hossain told reporters at his office in Dhaka that the country has sent a diplomatic note to India's Foreign Ministry for Hasina's extradition. 'We have informed India about our request to bring her back for the judicial process,' Hossain said. He didn't give further details. India's Foreign Ministry said it had received Bangladesh's request, but didn't immediately provide further details. Hasina fled to India after being ousted in a mass uprising in July and August in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands were injured. She faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has already issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organization Interpol for her arrest. Last month, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, said that his administration would seek the extradition of Hasina from India. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies. Authorities say that more than 750 people were killed and thousands more hurt during the mass uprising.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-seeks-extradition-of-ousted-leader-sheikh-hasina-from-india-/7911141.html	2024-12-23T06:28:03-08:00	
India-China frozen ties witness thaw in 2024	New Delhi — After a four-and-a-half-year military standoff along their disputed Himalayan border, ties between India and China witnessed a thaw in 2024 with both sides withdrawing troops from two flashpoints. But analysts say mistrust remains a key hurdle to restoration of friendly ties between the Asian giants. Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyan Jaishankar, told parliament this month that the pullback has set New Delhi-Beijing ties 'in the direction of some improvement.' But he stressed the need to restore stability on the frontier. 'We are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties.' While troops have stepped back from face-to-face confrontation along disputed stretches, tens of thousands of soldiers are still spending a fifth winter in the Himalayas while artillery and fighter jets remain deployed along the border. 'The mood on the border for four years has been one of preparing for war, therefore turning them into peacetime deployments is going to be an operational, mental, psychological and structural activity, which is, again, going to take a certain amount of time,' said Swaran Singh, professor at the School of International Studies at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Large stretches of the poorly defined 3,488-kilometer-long frontier between the two countries are disputed. Tensions had spiraled after a 2020 border skirmish that killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. A high-level diplomatic dialogue to discuss the boundary dispute resumed last week after five years. Following a meeting between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Adviser Wang Yi in Beijing, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to seek solutions that were 'fair, reasonable and acceptable to both sides,' according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. The two countries also decided to resume trips by Indian pilgrims to Tibet and restart border trade at a mountain pass. The ground for the thaw was laid by a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia in October. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Li Jian told reporters at a press briefing last week that Beijing is ready to work with India to enhance mutual trust and manage their differences. Analysts in New Delhi say India will be cautious moving ahead. 'Border-related issues is something that India wants to address first, and then expand into an overall larger normalization of relationship with China,' Singh said. Economic cooperation, however, is expected to move faster. China wants to tap into India’s growing market while New Delhi needs more Chinese imports as it seeks to become a manufacturing hub. Although bilateral trade has flourished despite the border crisis, India had put restrictions on Chinese investments and clamped down on issuing visas in the aftermath of the 2020 clash. 'While no one should expect a dramatic shift in political ties, economic ties will perhaps evolve in a much more accelerated manner and perhaps India would be much more liberal in opening up its markets or opening up certain sectors,' according to Harsh Pant, vice president for studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese foreign minister Wang asked his Indian counterpart to restore direct flights between the two countries that were suspended during the pandemic and facilitate visas for Chinese nationals at a meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 countries in Rio De Janeiro. 'China’s and India’s common interests far outweigh their differences. The two sides should see each other’s development as an opportunity,' Wang told Jaishankar. Analysts say the thaw between India and China – Asia’s two biggest countries -- will not impact the trajectory of New Delhi’s ties with Washington, which have gathered momentum in recent years partly over mutual concerns about Beijing’s assertiveness. Besides its Himalayan border, New Delhi is also concerned about China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean – Beijing has built ports in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and is constructing one in Myanmar. 'Both India and the U.S. want a certain kind of Indo-Pacific, a certain kind of geography, strategic geography, which is free, balanced, open and fair, which is also inclusive and, in some ways, those ideas will continue to propel the relationship,' Pant said. The countries are cooperating in areas ranging from defense to high technology. The U.S. is also India’s largest trading partner. New Delhi’s ties with Washington have witnessed some stresses. India, for instance, did not join U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia and has continued to import large quantities of crude oil from Moscow. Speaking recently at the launch of a foreign policy magazine, ‘India’s World,’ in New Delhi, Jaishankar said that ties between India and the U.S. will continue to deepen even if both sides do not see eye to eye on every issue. 'We have very honest conversations on where we agree and where we do not,' Jaishanker said. Calling their relationship 'important and large,' Jaishankar said, 'we factor these conversations but keep advancing that [overall] relationship.' Analysts say India will stay aligned with the United States and other Western countries in forums like the Quad. 'It is a win-win for both sides. China is a structural challenge for both India and the U.S. So irrespective of the fact whether there is a crisis or not, India and U.S. will continue to deepen their relationship,' said Sankalp Gurjar, assistant professor of geopolitics at the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-china-frozen-ties-witness-thaw-in-2024-/7911037.html	2024-12-23T05:05:58-08:00	
Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump can't have them executed	Washington — President Joe Biden announced on Monday that he is commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. The move spares the lives of people convicted in killings, including the slayings of police and military officers, people on federal land and those involved in deadly bank robberies or drug deals, as well as the killings of guards or prisoners in federal facilities. It means just three federal inmates are still facing execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh's Tree of life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. 'I've dedicated my career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system,' Biden said in a statement. 'Today, I am commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on federal death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole. These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.' The Biden administration in 2021 announced a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study the protocols used, which suspended executions during Biden's term. But Biden actually had promised to go further on the issue in the past, pledging to end federal executions without the caveats for terrorism and hate-motivated, mass killings. While running for president in 2020, Biden's campaign website said he would 'work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.' Similar language didn't appear on Biden's reelection website before he left the presidential race in July. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden's statement said. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president, and now president, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.' He took a political jab at Trump, saying, 'In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has spoken frequently of expanding executions. In a speech announcing his 2024 campaign, Trump called for those 'caught selling drugs to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts.' He later promised to execute drug and human smugglers and even praised China's harsher treatment of drug peddlers. During his first term as president, Trump also advocated for the death penalty for drug dealers. There were 13 federal executions during Trump's first term, more than under any president in modern history, and some may have happened fast enough to have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus at the federal death row facility in Indiana. Those were the first federal executions since 2003. The final three occurred after Election Day in November 2020 but before Trump left office the following January, the first time federal prisoners were put to death by a lame-duck president since Grover Cleveland in 1889. Biden faced recent pressure from advocacy groups urging him to act to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The president's announcement also comes less than two weeks after he commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of 39 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. The announcement also followed the post-election pardon that Biden granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges after long saying he would not issue one, sparking an uproar in Washington. The pardon also raised questions about whether he would issue sweeping preemptive pardons for administration officials and other allies who the White House worries could be unjustly targeted by Trump's second administration. Speculation that Biden could commute federal death sentences intensified last week after the White House announced he plans to visit Italy on the final foreign trip of his presidency next month. Biden, a practicing Catholic, will meet with Pope Francis, who recently called for prayers for U.S. death row inmates in hopes their sentences will be commuted. Martin Luther King III, who publicly urged Biden to change the death sentences, said in a statement issued by the White House that the president 'has done what no president before him was willing to do: take meaningful and lasting action not just to acknowledge the death penalty's racist roots but also to remedy its persistent unfairness.' Donnie Oliverio, a retired Ohio police officer whose partner was killed by one of the men whose death sentence was converted, said the execution of 'the person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace.' 'The president has done what is right here,' Oliverio said in a statement also issued by the White House, 'and what is consistent with the faith he and I share.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-gives-life-in-prison-to-37-of-40-federal-death-row-inmates-so-trump-can-t-have-them-executed-/7911024.html	2024-12-23T04:35:20-08:00	
Germany looking into possible security lapses after Christmas market attack	Berlin — Germany searched for answers on Monday on possible security lapses after a man drove his car into a Christmas market, killing at least five people and casting a renewed spotlight on security and immigration ahead of a snap election. The possible motive of the arrested suspect, a 50-year-old psychiatrist from Saudi Arabia with a history of anti-Islamic rhetoric and a sympathy for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, remains unknown. As a nation mourned, with citizens leaving flowers and lighting candles in Magdeburg where the incident took place on Friday, questions swirled about whether more could have been done and whether the authorities could have acted on warnings. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called for tougher internal security laws to be adopted, including a new act to strengthen police forces as well as the introduction of biometric surveillance. 'It is clear that we must do everything to protect the people of Germany from such horrific acts of violence. To do this, our security authorities need all the necessary powers and more personnel,' Faeser told Spiegel newsmagazine. The deputy head of a security committee in the Bundestag (parliament) announced he would convene a special session asking why previous warnings about the danger posed by the suspect, identified only as Taleb A., were not acted on. The arrested man has lived in Germany since 2006. The main opposition Christian Democratic Union, which is on course to form the next government after an election in February, called for the strengthening of intelligence services. 'We can no longer be satisfied with the fact that information about violent criminals and terrorists often only comes from foreign services,' Guenter Krings, justice spokesperson for the CDU, told the Handelsblatt newspaper. 'That is why our German security authorities need more powers of their own in order to gain more of their own knowledge, especially in the digital area.' The security services also must be able to remove dangerous people from circulation based on such knowledge, he said. 'The authority and obligation for official cooperation and data exchange must also be improved,' he said. Germany's data protection rules are among the strictest in the European Union, which federal police say has prevented them from resorting to biometric surveillance to date. Police in the northwestern city of Bremerhaven said on Monday they had arrested a man who had threatened in a TikTok video to commit 'serious crimes' at the local Christmas market. In the video, the man said he would target people who looked Arab or Mediterranean on Christmas Day. AfD LEADERS IN MAGDEBURG A committee in the local parliament of Saxony-Anhalt, the state where Magdeburg is located, will also convene to discuss the possible causes of the attack and its consequences, a state interior ministry spokesperson said. Holger Muench, president of the federal criminal police office (BKA), told public broadcaster ZDF over the weekend that Germany was reviewing security measures at Christmas markets and addressing any vulnerabilities. Muench said Germany had received a warning from Saudi Arabia as far back as 2023 about the suspect, which German authorities investigated but found vague. 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the Internet. He also had various contacts with the authorities, made insults and even threats. But he was not known for acts of violence,' Muench said. Leaders of the AfD, which has surged in support on an anti-immigration platform and is polling in second place ahead of the election, plan to stage an event in Magdeburg on Monday evening. 'The discussion about new security laws must not distract from the fact that #Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration,' AfD leader Alice Weidel said on social media. 'The state must protect citizens through a restrictive migration policy and consistent deportations!'

Lebanese prime minister visits south amid Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday visited Lebanese troops positions and U.N. peacekeeper posts in southern Lebanon, touring the region from which Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw under a nearly month-old ceasefire agreement. Mikati praised the role of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) after meeting with UNIFIL commanders, and began his tour with a visit to a Lebanese army barracks. He highlighted the need for Israeli troops to withdraw from Lebanon, saying the Lebanese military would then be able to carry out its tasks. The ceasefire agreement calls for Lebanese troops to deploy in southern Lebanon as Israeli and Hezbollah forces leave. Israeli troops entered the country at the end of September as part of an offensive aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from the border. The incursion was part of a significant intensification of the conflict, which had included lower-level cross-border attacks since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. Since the ceasefire with Hezbollah, Israeli forces have focused on the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Gaza medics said Monday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 20 people overnight. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Monday that Israel continues to strike densely populated areas in Gaza, 'including on areas where Israeli forces have ordered people to move, causing destruction, displacement and death.' Israeli officials have previously responded to similar assessments by blaming Hamas for operating in populated areas. Fletcher expressed concern about the ability to get aid into Gaza and into the hands of those in need, saying northern Gaza has been under 'a near-total siege for more than two months.' He said Israeli authorities have denied meaningful access to humanitarian workers, and that local gangs inside Gaza have engaged in 'systematic armed looting of our supplies.' 'We deal with tough places to deliver humanitarian support. But Gaza is currently the most dangerous, in a year when more humanitarians have been killed than any on record,' Fletcher said. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, and at least one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,200 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror organizations by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.

China says it provided information, documents in Baltic Sea cables inquiry	BEIJING — China has provided information and documents to a joint investigation into two severed Baltic Sea undersea cables, and has invited Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to participate in and complete the inquiry, the foreign ministry said on Monday. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a news briefing when asked about a Financial Times report that Sweden had criticized China for refusing full access despite an open investigation, and for not allowing its public prosecutor to board the suspect ship, Yi Peng 3. The Chinese bulk carrier is moving again after sitting still for more than a month in Danish waters, the Swedish Coastguard said on Saturday. China last week allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board the vessel for the investigation. 'In order to cooperate with the investigation, the Yi Peng 3 has been suspended for a long period of time, and in order to safeguard the physical and mental health of the crew, the shipowner company has decided to resume its voyage after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with the parties concerned,' Mao said. She added that China had notified all relevant countries in advance and was willing to maintain communication and cooperation. Yi Peng 3 came under investigation following the breach in November of two fiber-optic cables - one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania - that raised suspicions of sabotage and concerns about the security of critical infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-provided-information-documents-in-baltic-sea-cables-inquiry-/7910927.html	2024-12-23T01:55:41-08:00	
South Korean opposition threatens to impeach Han over martial law counsel	SEOUL — South Korea's main opposition party threatened on Monday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo if he failed to approve legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol's failed bid to impose martial law. Prime Minister Han has taken over from the suspended Yoon, who was impeached on Dec. 14 and faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him. With a majority in parliament, the opposition Democratic Party (DP) passed a bill this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations. The party, which has accused Han of aiding Yoon's martial law attempt and reported him to police, said it would 'immediately initiate impeachment proceedings' against the acting president if the legislation was not promulgated by Tuesday. 'The delays show that the prime minister has no intention of complying with the constitution, and it is tantamount to admitting that he is acting as a proxy for the insurgent,' Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae told a party meeting, referring to Yoon. Han is a technocrat who has held leadership roles in South Korean politics for 30 years under conservative and liberal presidents. Yoon appointed him prime minister in 2022. Han's office could not immediately be reached for comment. He has previously said he had tried to block Yoon's martial law declaration, but apologized for failing to do so. Park also accused Yoon of hampering the Constitutional Court trial by repeatedly refusing to accept court documents, intended primarily to notify Yoon of the beginning of the trial. 'Any delay in the investigation and impeachment trials is an extension of the insurrection and an act of plotting a second one,' Park said. Yoon's ruling People Power Party accused the DP of employing what it called 'impeachment politics' and taking Han's political fate 'hostage' to push through the special counsel despite multiple ongoing investigations. A Constitutional Court spokesperson said on Monday it had decided to consider the presidential office's refusal to receive the documents as delivery completed, and proceed with the trial. A joint investigative team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials has made a second attempt to call Yoon in for questioning on Dec. 25, though it was unclear whether he would appear. Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer helping form Yoon's defense team, told reporters on Monday that he was not delaying the trial but needed time to prepare, and would respond to any investigations after a decision on the impeachment was made. Woo Jong-soo, investigation chief of the national police agency, told parliament on Monday that police had tried to raid Yoon's office twice but the presidential security service denied them entry. Woo said his team sent a request to preserve evidence, including a secure phone server.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-opposition-threatens-to-impeach-han-over-martial-law-counsel-/7910923.html	2024-12-23T01:39:20-08:00	
Nissan, Honda announce plans to merge, creating world's No. 3 automaker	TOKYO — Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger, forming world’s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels. The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will pursue unifying their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. The aim is to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal by August 2026, he said. No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said. There are 'points that need to be studied and discussed,' he said. 'Frankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.' Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time. News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi. A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon. Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a 'desperate move.' From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn’t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press. Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said. But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of $61 million. It recently reshuffled its management and Makoto Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. 'We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,' Uchida said. Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan’s credit outlook to 'negative,' citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to $9.4 billion. Nissan’s share price also has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation. At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast-changing global market. 'As the business environment surrounding the automobile industry largely changes, with competitiveness in storage batteries and software is increasingly important, we expect measures needed to survive international competition will be taken,' Hayashi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nissan-honda-announce-plans-to-merge-creating-world-s-no-3-automaker-/7910919.html	2024-12-23T01:18:44-08:00	
South Korea says North Korea preparing to send more troops, weapons to Russia	South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday there are indications that North Korea is preparing to send more troops and weapons to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. The additional weapons being readied include suicide drones, and North Korea has already sent 240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery to Russia, the JCS said in a statement. North Korea has also sent about 12,000 troops already to Russia, according to South Korea, the United States and Ukraine. The JCS said Monday that at least 1,100 of the North Koreans have been killed or wounded. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 47 aerial drones that Russian forces launched in attacks overnight targeting multiple areas of the country. The Ukrainian air force said Russia used a total of 72 drones in its latest round of daily aerial assaults. Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said on Telegram that the drone attacks damaged a business and some homes, while injuring one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed a Ukrainian aerial drone over the Bryansk region, which is located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties from the Ukrainian attack. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-north-korea-preparing-to-send-more-troops-weapons-to-russia/7910907.html	2024-12-23T00:46:43-08:00	
Romanian parliament expected to approve new government	BUCHAREST — Romania's outgoing president Klaus Iohannis is expected Monday to designate leftist Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu to form a new government after three pro-European parties agreed to the details of a parliamentary majority. The Social Democrat Party (PSD) will hold eight cabinet posts including justice, transport, labor and defense, and most of its current ministers will stay on in their posts. The centrist Liberal Party (PNL) will have six cabinet jobs, including energy and interior and foreign ministries. The ethnic Hungarian party UDMR will have two posts, including finance. Together with representatives of local ethnic minorities, the three parties will have a slim majority in the legislative in which three ultranationalist and hard-right parties won over a third of seats in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election. The new government will need to approve a calendar for a new two-round presidential election. The three parties in the coalition have agreed to back a single presidential candidate in an attempt to prevent a representative from the radical right from winning. The original three rounds of votes to elect a new president and parliament in the European Union and NATO state, which shares the longest land border with Ukraine, descended into chaos when a little-known far-right pro-Russian politician won the first presidential round on Nov. 24. His shocking win prompted Romania's top court to annul the election on suspicion of Russian meddling and order that it be re-run, likely in the first part of 2025. Romania's new cabinet will also have the daunting task of lowering the budget deficit from an expected 8.6% of economic output this year - the EU's largest - to around 7% in 2025 and ratings agencies and analysts expect tax hikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-parliament-expected-to-approve-new-government-/7910900.html	2024-12-23T00:20:40-08:00	
Senegal's toy makers thrive ahead of Christmas	Senegal's local toymakers are experiencing a boom in demand ahead of Christmas, with sellers hoping to win market share with high-quality products that reflect the country’s culture and values. Mostly Muslim Senegal has a strong tradition in which different religions share and enjoy each other’s holidays. Christmas is an example in the capital Dakar, where the city is lit up with decorations in December and holiday markets draw families seeking gifts in this West African nation. Awa Gaye, the co-founder of the toy brand Yeewu, was among the sellers at a bustling Christmas market this month. She launched the business after having a daughter and realizing there were few toys that made her feel valued. 'She couldn’t see herself reflected in the toys she played with. So, we decided to create a brand,' Gaye said. Yeewu dolls are adorned with African hairstyles and clothing, and carry inscriptions in the widely spoken local language Wolof. The idea is still new to some Senegalese parents, who sometimes ask her for white dolls or for writing in French. Another local producer, Racky Daffé, founder of Senegalese toy brand Alyfa, is known for toys that promote Senegalese culture, like traditional wrestler figurines or dolls that come in a wide range of skin tones, including albino. Daffé says demand is growing, but there are challenges competing against cheaper, imported products. In Senegal, there are often shortages of raw materials or financing that constrain production. 'The biggest challenge compared with global brands is that we cannot produce at the scale needed to offer these toys at a price affordable for the Senegalese middle class,' said Daffé. Distributors, who have had rising sales in the past few years, are aware of the constraints. At Kidz Palace, a toy distributor in Dakar, chief executive Fatimetou Diop, said the toys sell quickly among families that want educational toys that reflect the country's cultural identity. 'The market cannot always be supplied consistently,' Diop said. 'Sometimes we run out of stock due to raw material shortages or financing issues. Local manufacturers often face these constraints.' Daffé remains optimistic that demand for Senegalese toys will remain strong, and noted that children often point out toys that look like them. 'It’s really about representing an entire community. Every child can see themselves through our toys,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-toy-makers-thrive-ahead-of-christmas/7910892.html	2024-12-22T23:53:18-08:00	
Malaysia's 1MDB files legal claim against Amicorp Group seeking over $1 billion for alleged fraud	KUALA LUMPUR — Scandal-hit Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad said on Monday it has filed a legal claim of more than $1 billion against corporate services provider Amicorp Group and its CEO, alleging the firm knowingly facilitated over $7 billion in fraudulent transactions. The claim, among one of the biggest filed by 1MDB related to the multibillion dollar graft scandal, was filed in the British Virgin Islands against eight Amicorp entities and its Chief Executive Officer Toine Knipping, alleging that they played a vital role in enabling the sovereign wealth fund to be defrauded between 2009 and 2014, 1MDB said in a statement. Amicorp Group did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment and repeated phone calls. Malaysian and U.S. investigators had previously estimated $4.5 billion was siphoned away from 1MDB following its inception in 2009, implicating former Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman Sachs staff and high-level officials elsewhere. Najib is currently in prison but has denied wrongdoing. 1MDB alleges Hong Kong-headquartered Amicorp created and managed a complex conspiracy consisting of layers of shell companies, sham transactions, and fraudulent financial structures that obscured the true origin and destination of the funds. Stolen funds were purportedly routed through Singapore, Barbados, Curacao, Hong Kong, and the British Virgin Islands, 1MDB said. It further alleges that Amicorp provided access to the global financial system through Amicorp Bank, a bank registered in Barbados, and provided fund entities and banking services to allow the repeated cycling of assets, giving the impression that 1MDB’s assets had been invested and generated returns when in fact they had been misappropriated. 1MDB said it is seeking damages for the losses it incurred from Amicorp's 'dishonest' assistance in breaches of fiduciary duty and conspiracy to commit unlawful acts, adding the legal action was part of a global effort to recover stolen 1MDB assets. 'There is, in our view, strong evidence to suggest that Amicorp – at the highest levels – knew they were involved in a dishonest and illegal money laundering scheme designed to transfer large sums of cash away from its intended beneficiary - the people of Malaysia,' a spokesperson for 1MDB said in the statement. As of September this year, Malaysia has recovered $6.06 billion linked to 1MDB, state news agency Bernama reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-1mdb-files-legal-claim-against-amicorp-group-seeking-over-1-billion-for-alleged-fraud-/7910880.html	2024-12-22T23:05:16-08:00	
Makers of Taiwan's 'Zero Day' TV series set around invasion fear backlash from China	TAIPEI — A Chinese war plane goes missing near Taiwan. China sends swarms of military boats and planes for a blockade as Taiwan goes on a war footing. Panic ensues on the streets of Taipei. The premise of 'Zero Day,' a new Taiwan TV drama envisioning a Chinese invasion, is a topic that has for years been considered too sensitive for many Taiwan filmmakers and television show creators, who fear losing access to the lucrative Chinese entertainment market. But as China steps up military threats, including the large massing of naval forces last week and daily military activities close to the island, the upcoming drama confronts the fear by setting the 10-episode series around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. 'We thought there is freedom in Taiwan, but in film and TV production we are restricted by China on many levels,' said Cheng Hsin Mei, the showrunner on 'Zero Day.' China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory over the objections of the government in Taipei, is a much larger market for film and television. Taiwanese entertainers are popular there partly due to language and cultural similarities. Cheng said creators in free and democratic Taiwan, however, are indirectly confined by Beijing's powerful state censorship. Beijing has regularly called out Taiwanese artists seen as violating China's political ideology and has threatened to blacklist those unwilling to cooperate. China pressured a popular Taiwanese rock band to make pro-China comments ahead of Taiwan's presidential vote early this year, sources told Reuters. Beijing denied pressuring the group Mayday. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. BUZZ IN TAIWAN For the 'Zero Day' crew, confronting such a sensitive topic means facing difficulties, from funding and casting, to finding places to film. Cheng said more than half of the 'Zero Day' crew asked to remain anonymous on the crew list, and some people including a director pulled out of the production at the last minute, due to worries it might jeopardize their future work in China or concerns about the safety of their families working there. 'Our freedom is hard-earned,' Cheng said, adding people should not give in easily due to fears over China. 'The People's Liberation Army has launched substantial incursions against us and they are getting closer and closer,' she said. 'We should look at this directly rather than pretending that it is not happening.' The show, which is set to be broadcast online and on yet-to-be announced television channels next year, is already creating buzz in Taiwan after the extended trailer went online in July. The drama focuses on several scenarios Taiwan might face in the days leading up to a Chinese attack, including a global financial collapse, the activation of Chinese sleeper agents and panicked residents trying to flee the island. 'Without freedom, Taiwan is not Taiwan,' the actor who plays a fictional Taiwan president says in a televised speech, urging unity after declaring war on China, in the show's trailer. The live broadcast then gets abruptly cut off, replaced by a feed of a Chinese state television anchor calling for Taiwanese to surrender and to report 'hidden pro-independence activists' to Chinese soldiers after their landing in Taiwan. Milton Lin, a 75-year-old Taipei resident, said he was grateful the TV series was putting a spotlight on the threats by China. 'It helps Taiwanese to understand that we are facing a strong enemy trying to annex us and how we should be on guard with unity to face such an invasion.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/makers-of-taiwan-s-zero-day-tv-series-set-around-invasion-fear-backlash-from-china/7910812.html	2024-12-22T21:38:36-08:00	
Why people in Africa's most populous country are risking their lives for holiday handouts	Abuja, Nigeria — Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children. Families are struggling during the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. At least 35 children were killed in southwestern Oyo state on Wednesday. And on Saturday, 22 people died in southeastern Anambra state while 10 died in the capital, Abuja, where more than 1,000 people had gathered at a church to receive clothes and food. Here are some issues facing Nigerians. Inflation at a 28-year high 'There is hunger in this Nigeria. Every Nigerian needs food,' one woman, in tears, told the local Arise television after the stampede in Abuja. The economic crisis is blamed on the government's policies to save money and attract investors, which have contributed to pushing the inflation rate to a 28-year high of 34.6%. Meanwhile, the naira currency languishes at record lows against the dollar. At least 63% of Nigeria's more than 210 million people population is poor, according to the government's statistics office. The government has struggled to create jobs. And when people gather to protest hardship, security forces are quick to clamp down. In August, more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces during nationwide protests. 'The average Nigerian has seen food go out of their reach,' said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm. In 2022, the firm found that about 97% of Nigerians spend up to 63% of their income on food, but that share must have grown since then, he said. Some of those who died in Abuja had waited overnight outside the church in cold weather for the chance to enter early, according to Loveth Inyang, a witness who rescued a baby from the crush. Security is costly, too Deadly stampedes are not new in Nigeria and are often caused by lack of adherence to public safety measures. But analysts say people's desperation to survive is making crowd control more difficult. Accounts from witnesses and police in Abuja and Anambra showed that the stampedes occurred before the events started as people tried to secure prime positions. In Abuja, the church was forced to cancel the event, leaving bags of rice and clothing items inside. Organizers of such charity events often do not consider security a priority, said Ademola Adetuberu, who runs the Abuja-based Barricade Executive Protection security firm. Meanwhile, the number of events is increasing as philanthropists and organizations try to meet the growing demand for food. 'If organizers of such events brainstorm more, get professionals to advise them and have a budget for security, this can be prevented,' Adetuberu said. How authorities are responding Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has asked authorities to no longer tolerate 'operational lapses' by organizers of such events, while police have made it mandatory for organizers to get prior permission before hosting them. But such commitments are not new and usually difficult to enforce, analysts said. 'People's incomes have been squeezed through the entire year. When they hear somewhere that food is being distributed, their natural instinct is to go,' Nwanze said. 'Add this to our notoriously poor queue culture and you have the perfect storm that will lead to such a stampede.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-people-in-africa-s-most-populous-country-are-risking-their-lives-for-holiday-handouts/7910760.html	2024-12-22T17:37:41-08:00	
El Gordo' lottery in Spain spreads Christmas riches worth $2.8 billion	Madrid — For weeks, Spaniards had anticipated the arrival of 'El Gordo' or 'The Fat One.' But unlike Santa Claus, El Gordo arrived three days before Christmas, before noon on Sunday. El Gordo is the first prize of Spain's hugely popular national Christmas lottery, which is said to be the world's largest based on the total prize money involved, even though other lotteries have larger single prizes. This year's draw will spread riches of around $2.8 billion, much of it in small winnings. Several ticket holders with the number 72480 won the top prize, worth about $417,000 before taxes. The winning tickets were sold in Logrono, a city in northern Spain's La Rioja region that is known for its wines. Multiple tickets with the same number can be sold to different groups and full tickets are divisible into 10 parts. Buying and sharing these fractions, known in Spanish as 'décimos' or tenths, is a popular tradition in the run-up to Christmas. Families, friends, and co-workers often take part, usually spending $21 each. On Sunday, young students from Madrid's San Ildefonso school selected the numbers from two revolving orbs in the capital's Teatro Real opera house and sang them out in turn for nearly five hours in a cadence familiar to Spaniards. After 'El Gordo' was announced, audience members — some dressed in costume as Don Quijote, Christmas elves, Biblical wise men and the lottery itself — began streaming out of the venue, from which the event was televised nationally. María Angeles, a teacher from the southwestern province of Badajoz, said she waited for hours in line to get a seat inside the opera house to watch the event with a group of 14 friends and family members that she traveled with to Madrid. 'The point of coming to see the lottery is the hope,' Angeles said. She reckoned no one in her group won more than $146. The lottery works on the premise of distributing the most winning numbers to the largest number of people possible. There are hundreds of small prizes and 13 major ones, including the 'El Gordo' winner. In the weeks leading up to the draw, lines form outside lottery offices, especially those with a history of selling prize-winning tickets in previous years. Spain's Dec. 22 Christmas lottery began during the Napoleonic wars in 1812 and has continued largely without interruption since then, even during the Spanish Civil War. Students from the San Ildefonso school have been singing the prizes since the start. Spain's national lottery was first established as a charity in 1763 by the Bourbon monarch King Carlos III. It was later used to shore up state coffers. Today, it supports various charities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-gordo-lottery-in-spain-spreads-christmas-riches-worth-2-8-billion/7910758.html	2024-12-22T17:21:36-08:00	
Russia captures two villages in Ukraine as Moscow's forces advance on two cities	Russian forces captured two villages in Ukraine, one in Kharkiv region in the northeast and one in eastern Donetsk region, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday. Donetsk region is where Moscow is concentrating most of its efforts to seize two cities. Russian forces, making steady progress across Donetsk region, are moving on the towns of Pokrovsk, a logistics center and site of an important coking colliery, and appear to be closing in on Kurakhove, farther south. The Defense Ministry statement said troops had taken control of Lozova, near the town of Kupiansk, in an area north of Donetsk region also under Russian pressure in recent weeks. The village of Sontsivka, north of Kurakhove, was also captured. The ministry on Saturday announced the capture of another village near Kurakhove, Kostiantynopolske. The Ukraine military's general staff made no mention of those villages falling into Russian hands, but said Sontsivka was in a sector subject to 26 Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. The general staff also reported heavy fighting near Pokrovsk, with 34 Russian attempts to pierce defenses. The popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said Sontsivka was under Russian control. Russian reports have described intensified pressure on Kurakhove. The Moscow-appointed governor of areas of Donetsk region occupied by Russian forces, Denis Pushilin, said on Telegram that Russian troops now controlled the town center. He also said troops were advancing on Pokrovsk from the south. Russian troops have been moving through eastern Ukraine in the past two months at the fastest rate since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Friday its forces had pulled back from the area around two villages -- one near Pokrovsk, the other near Kurakhove -- to avoid being encircled by advancing Russian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-captures-two-villages-in-ukraine-as-moscow-s-forces-advance-on-two-cities/7910751.html	2024-12-22T17:08:12-08:00	
Pope Francis calls for ceasefire on all fronts in his prayer ahead of Christmas	Vatican City — Pope Francis called for a ceasefire on all war fronts in his Sunday Angelus prayer ahead of Christmas, condemning the 'cruelty' of bombing schools and hospitals in Ukraine and Gaza. 'Let the weapons fall silent and let the Christmas carols ring out!' Francis said, delivering his Sunday blessing from indoors due to a cold and as a precaution ahead of a busy Christmas period. 'Let us pray that at Christmas there will be a ceasefire on all war fronts, in Ukraine, in the Holy Land, throughout the Middle East and throughout the world,' the pope said. Francis recalled, as he often does, the 'battered Ukraine' that continues to be hit by attacks on cities, 'which sometimes damage schools, hospitals and churches.' He also expressed his pain thinking of Gaza, 'of such cruelty, to the machine-gunning of children, to the bombing of schools and hospitals ... How much cruelty!' Francis on Saturday also criticized Israel's actions in Gaza and said that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing. Israeli authorities on Sunday allowed Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, to enter Gaza and celebrate a pre-Christmas Mass with members of the territory's small Christian community. Israel says it has made great efforts to spare civilians and is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war. The pontiff, who turned 88 this past week, appeared in good shape on Sunday, after looking wheezing and congested during his annual Christmas greeting to Vatican bureaucrats on Saturday. The Vatican cited the cold temperatures outside and Francis' strenuous week ahead in deciding to deliver his Sunday blessing indoors. The pope on Tuesday is due to inaugurate his big Holy Year and preside over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day celebrations in St. Peter's Basilica. On Thursday, he is scheduled to travel to Rome's main prison to inaugurate the Jubilee there. Francis has long suffered bouts of bronchitis, especially in winter. In 2023, he ended up in hospital to receive intravenous antibiotics. He had part of one lung removed as a young man and frequently seems out of breath, especially after walking or exerting himself.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-calls-for-ceasefire-on-all-fronts-in-his-prayer-ahead-of-christmas/7910745.html	2024-12-22T16:52:43-08:00	
In a calendar rarity, Hanukkah starts this year on Christmas Day	Hanukkah, Judaism's eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. For some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement. 'This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,' said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents. 'The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,' he said. 'It's others seeing you as you see yourself.' One example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city's Latino and Jewish communities for a 'cross cultural holiday celebration.' The venue: Houston's Holocaust museum. The food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song 'Hava Nagila.' 'What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,' said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. Rabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the partygoers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and 'Anglo' Jews. 'There's too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,' Tarlow said. 'This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.' While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it's taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism. Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they're visible through household windows and in public spaces. 'The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,' Hauer said. 'It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,' he added. 'We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.' Hauer concurred with Stanton that this year's overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is 'an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.' Rabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time. 'Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it's not taken for granted,' Seligson said. 'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.' He said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world. 'There certainly is some apprehension,' Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. 'Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.' 'What I'm hearing is there's no way that we can't,' he added. 'The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.' Stanton concurred. 'Through our history, we've been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,' he said. 'Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.' Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term 'Chrismukkah' — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama 'The O.C.' embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother. This season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called 'Leah's Perfect Gift,' depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly. Despite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays. 'The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,' he said. 'It's a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-a-calendar-rarity-hanukkah-starts-this-year-on-christmas-day/7910740.html	2024-12-22T16:42:06-08:00	
Syria's new leader says all weapons to come under 'state control'	Damascus, Syria — Two weeks after seizing power in a sweeping offensive, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa on Sunday said weapons in the country, including those held by Kurdish-led forces, would come under state control. Sharaa spoke alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, after earlier meeting with Lebanese Druze leaders and vowing to end 'negative interference' in the neighboring country. Ankara-backed rebels played a key role in supporting Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed a rebel alliance that seized Damascus on December 8, toppling longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. During a press conference with Fidan, Sharaa said Syria's armed 'factions will begin to announce their dissolution and enter' the army. 'We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control, whether from the revolutionary factions or the factions present in the SDF area,' he added, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Sharaa traded in the olive-green military shirt he sported just days ago for a suit and tie during his meetings on Sunday at the presidential palace. He also said, 'We are working on protecting sects and minorities from any attacks that occur between them' and from 'external' actors exploiting the situation 'to cause sectarian discord.' 'Syria is a country for all and we can coexist together,' he added. That sentiment was on display at the colorfully lit Christmas market in Damascus, where Batoul al-Law, a dietician, said there were more Muslims than Christians. 'We have always celebrated both Christian and Muslim holidays together,' she said, but 'you feel that people are now happier and more comfortable.' Turkey's Fidan said sanctions on Syria must 'be lifted as soon as possible.' He called for the international community to 'mobilize to help Syria get back on its feet and for the displaced people to return.' Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed more than a half-million people and displaced more than half its population, with many of them fleeing to neighboring countries, including 3 million in Turkey. Turkey has maintained strong ties with Syria's new leaders and has continued military operations against Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria. A senior German diplomat, Tobias Tunkel, on Sunday said on X that he had spoken with SDF leader Mazloum Abdi about rising tensions in the Kurdish-held border town of Kobane 'and urgent steps to diffuse them.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a woman and her child were killed in 'artillery shelling by pro-Turkey factions' in the Kobane countryside, and the factions clashed with the SDF further south. Ankara regards the People's Protection Units (YPG), the main component of the SDF, as being connected to the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) at home, which both Turkey and Western allies deem a 'terrorist' organization. Regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia is also in direct contact with Syria's new authorities, having supported the opposition to Assad for years during Syria's civil war. Riyadh will send a delegation to the country soon, Syria's ambassador in the Saudi capital said. During his meeting with visiting Lebanese Druze chiefs Walid and Taymur Jumblatt, Sharaa said Syria would no longer engage in 'negative interference in Lebanon at all.' Syria 'will stay at equal distance from all' in Lebanon, Sharaa added, acknowledging that Syria has been a 'source of fear and anxiety' for its neighbor. Walid Jumblatt, a fierce critic of Assad and his father, Hafez, who ruled Syria before him, arrived in Damascus on Sunday at the head of a delegation of lawmakers from his parliamentary bloc and Druze religious figures. The Druze religious minority is spread across Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976, only leaving in 2005 after enormous pressure and mass protests following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a killing attributed to Damascus and its ally, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group. The seizure of power by the Sunni Islamists of HTS – considered a terrorist organization by many governments, including the United States -- has sparked concern, though the group has in recent years sought to moderate its image. Global powers, including the United States and the European Union, have stepped up contacts with the war-ravaged country's new leaders, urging them to guarantee protections for women and minorities. The foreign leaders have also stressed the importance of combating 'terrorism and extremism.' Assad had long played a strategic role in Iran's 'axis of resistance,' a loose alliance of regional proxy forces aligned against Israel, particularly in facilitating the supply of weapons to Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. That axis has suffered heavy blows over the past year with Israel's devastation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on Sunday nonetheless denied that these armed groups acted as proxies, adding that: 'If one day we want to take action, we do not need a proxy force.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-leader-says-all-weapons-to-come-under-state-control/7910729.html	2024-12-22T16:17:41-08:00	
Custom clocks designed for Pennsylvania's Capitol a century ago still ticking	Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. As the seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately — and frequently capped by a dome. Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design. The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features. They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls. And every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls — ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking. On a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done — going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one. Gill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee. She's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time. Why? 'My dad was a clock collector growing up,' Gill said. 'And every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.' Pennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy — a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe. Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State. 'The clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,' said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. 'The mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.' Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound. Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation. While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/custom-clocks-designed-for-pennsylvania-s-capitol-a-century-ago-still-ticking/7910492.html	2024-12-22T15:55:02-08:00	
Albanian PM says TikTok ban was not 'rushed reaction to a single incident'	Tirana, Albania — Albania's prime minister said Sunday the ban on TikTok his government announced a day earlier was 'not a rushed reaction to a single incident.' Edi Rama said Saturday the government will shut down TikTok for one year, accusing the popular video service of inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. Authorities have held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents since the November stabbing death of a teenager by another teen after a quarrel that started on social media apps. Ninety percent of them approve of the ban on TikTok. 'The ban on TikTok for one year in Albania is not a rushed reaction to a single incident, but a carefully considered decision made in consultation with parent communities in schools across the country,' said Rama. Following Tirana's decision, TikTok asked for 'urgent clarity from the Albanian government' in the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had 'found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.' 'To claim that the killing of the teenage boy has no connection to TikTok because the conflict didn't originate on the platform demonstrates a failure to grasp both the seriousness of the threat TikTok poses to children and youth today and the rationale behind our decision to take responsibility for addressing this threat,' Rama said. 'Albania may be too small to demand that TikTok protect children and youth from the frightening pitfalls of its algorithm,' he said, blaming TikTok for 'the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on.' Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. Many youngsters in Albania did not approve of the ban. 'We disclose our daily life and entertain ourselves, that is, we exploit it during our free time,' said Samuel Sulmani, an 18-year-old in the town of Rreshen, 75 kilometers north of the capital Tirana, on Sunday. 'We do not agree with that because that's a deprivation for us.' But Albanian parents have been increasingly concerned following reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok. 'Our decision couldn't be clearer: Either TikTok protects the children of Albania, or Albania will protect its children from TikTok,' Rama said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-pm-says-tiktok-ban-was-not-rushed-reaction-to-a-single-incident-/7910489.html	2024-12-22T15:41:36-08:00	
China says US is 'playing with fire' after latest military aid for Taiwan	Beijing — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is 'playing with fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory and says must come under its control. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called 'dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.' U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack. The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's 'commitment to our defense.' In October, the U.S. approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, also drawing China's criticism while Beijing has responded with war drills around Taiwan. Taiwan earlier this month demanded that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-us-is-playing-with-fire-after-latest-military-aid-for-taiwan/7910486.html	2024-12-22T15:24:58-08:00	
Mozambique council to rule on election results Monday	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique's constitutional council will announce Monday whether it will validate the results of elections that have plunged the country into deadly turmoil, the body said. Exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane has threatened to call 'a popular uprising' if the Constitutional Council approves initial results that found he came second in the Oct. 9 vote behind the ruling Frelimo party candidate. Constitutional council president Lucia da Luz Ribeiro will make 'the proclamation of the definitive results' of the presidential and legislative elections at a public hearing on Monday, the council said in a statement. The election commission results said that Mondlane won 20 percent of the presidential vote compared to 71% for Daniel Chapo, the Frelimo candidate. Mondlane has said the result was rigged and that he won 53% of the vote. Several international observer missions have also said there were irregularities. More than two months of political unrest has left at least 130 dead, according to the Plataforma Decide non-government group. Mondlane has said there will be 'chaos' and a 'new popular uprising of a scale never seen' if the earlier results are validated. He has taken refuge abroad, saying he fears for his safety. Frelimo has ruled the poor southern African state since independence from Portugal in 1975.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-council-to-rule-on-election-results-monday/7910484.html	2024-12-22T15:07:09-08:00

Pakistan faces backlash over military court convictions of 25 civilians	Islamabad — The European Union Sunday decried military court verdicts against 25 supporters of Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister, Imran Khan, affirming that these rulings contravene the country’s international obligations to ensure a fair and public trial for civilians. The individuals were tried and sentenced to 'vigorous imprisonment' ranging from two to 10 years in connection with attacks on military facilities during nationwide anti-government protests in May 2023, as announced by the Pakistani army on Saturday. The statement did not provide further details or publicize the verdicts, promising to announce sentences to the dozens of remaining accused 'in connection with the violence as and when the due process is complete.' In a statement released Sunday, the EU expressed concern over the sentencing of the 25 civilians. 'These verdicts are seen as inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),' it said. The multilateral treaty obligates nations to provide individuals 'with a fair and public trial in a court that is independent, impartial and competent, and has the right to adequate and effective legal representation.' The EU stated the treaty mandates that any judgment rendered in a criminal case be made public. The statement emphasized that countries benefiting from the EU’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, or GSP+, facility, including Pakistan, have voluntarily agreed to implement 27 international core conventions, including the ICCPR, effectively. The GSP+ designation grants zero import duties on more than two-thirds of tariff lines when exporting to the European Union, providing Pakistan, a cash-strapped nation, with a major and crucial trade partner. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party, which led the anti-government protests last year, promptly rejected the rulings as a blatant violation of human rights and the rule of law within the country. The party has long asserted that the riots were the result of operatives within the military who had infiltrated ranks of peaceful protesters. 'The actual perpetrators orchestrated a false flag operation on that day and are now utilizing military trials to serve as judge, jury and executioner, targeting innocent civilians,' the PTI asserted in a tweet on its X social media platform. Since August 2023, Khan has been incarcerated and faces multiple charges, including allegedly inciting attacks against military facilities, despite being in police custody when the nationwide protests erupted last year, demanding his release. Pakistan’s prestigious English-language DAWN newspaper slammed the military convictions in a Sunday editorial. 'Can serving officers, bound by military hierarchy, truly provide independent judgments? The one-line descriptions of convictions accompanying the names of the 25 individuals hardly qualify as reasoned judgments,' the paper asked. 'That such trials are occurring under civilian leadership adds a layer of irony to this distressing situation. Pakistan’s democracy, still finding its feet, cannot afford such compromises on core democratic values,' the editorial read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-faces-backlash-over-military-court-convictions-of-25-civilians/7910477.html	2024-12-22T14:36:30-08:00	
Trump threatens to retake control of Panama Canal	West Palm Beach, Florida — President-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona on Sunday, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the 'wrong hands,' warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage. China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed two ports located on the Caribbean and Pacific entrances to the canal. The president-elect's comments came hours after he leveled a similar threat against Panama in a post on Truth Social on Saturday night. 'Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?' Trump said on Sunday at AmericaFest, an annual event organized by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. 'Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.' Trump's comments were an exceedingly rare example of a U.S. leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in U.S. diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts. 'The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, highly unfair,' Trump said. 'It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions. You get to treat us fairly, and they haven't treated us fairly. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.' In a recorded message released by Panamanian President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nation's leader said that Panama's independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canal's administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set 'on a whim.' 'Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging [to Panama],' Mulino said in the statement, which was released on X. Several other Panamanian politicians, including members of the opposition, also took to social media to criticize Trump's statements. The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration. The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5% of global seaborne trade and is critical to U.S. imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for U.S. exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas. It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage. This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place. Trump's appearance at AmericaFest capped a four-day event that drew more than 20,000 activists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-to-retake-control-of-panama-canal/7910466.html	2024-12-22T13:57:10-08:00	
Native American tribe closer to acquiring more land in Arizona after decades of delay	Federal officials have joined with the state of Arizona to begin fulfilling a settlement agreement that was reached with the Hopi Tribe nearly three decades ago, marking what tribal officials described as a historic day. Government attorneys filed condemnation documents on Friday to transfer dozens of square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi. The tribe will compensate the state nearly $4 million for more than 80 square kilometers of land near Winslow. It could mark the first of more transfers of land into trust to help eliminate the checkerboard of ownership that characterizes much of the lands used by the tribe for ranching in northeastern Arizona. A long time coming Friday's filing was born out of the 1996 passage of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act, which ratified an agreement between the Hopi and federal government that set conditions for taking land into trust for the tribe. The wrangling over land in northeastern Arizona has been bitter, pitting the Hopi and the Navajo Nation against one another for generations. The federal government failed in its attempt to have the tribes share land and after years of escalating conflict, Congress in 1974 divided the area and ordered tribal members to leave each other's reservations. The resulting borders meant the Navajo Nation — the country's largest reservation at close to 70,000 square kilometers — surrounded the nearly 6,500-square-kilometer Hopi reservation. Since the 1996 settlement, the Hopi Tribe has purchased private land and sought to take neighboring state lands into trust in hopes of consolidating property for the tribe's benefit. A historic day There have been many roadblocks along the way, including in 2018 when the tribe sought the support of local governments in northern Arizona to back a proposed transfer for land south of the busy Interstate 40 corridor. Those efforts were stymied by the inclusion of national forest tracts in the Flagstaff area. Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma said in a statement Friday that he was grateful for everyone who worked to make the condemnation filing a reality and that the timing for this historic moment was fitting. 'Within Hopi, it is our time of the soyal'ang ceremony — the start of the New Year and the revitalization of life,' he said. Gov. Katie Hobbs, who first visited the Hopi reservation in 2023, acknowledged that the tribe has been fighting for its rights for decades and that politicians of the past had refused to hear the voices of tribal communities. 'Every Arizonan should have an opportunity to thrive and a space to call home, and this agreement takes us one step closer to making those Arizona values a reality,' she said Friday. More transfers and economic opportunities In November, the Navajo Nation signed a warranty deed to take into trust a parcel of land near Flagstaff as part of the federal government's outstanding obligations to support members of that tribe who were forcibly relocated as a result of the Navajo-Hopi dispute. Navajo leaders are considering building a casino on the newly acquired land, saying such a project would provide significant economic benefits. For the Hopi, bringing more land into trust also holds the promise of more economic opportunities. The state lands near Winslow that are part of the condemnation filing are interspersed with Hopi-owned lands and have long been leased to the tribe for ranching and agricultural purposes, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Federal officials said Friday's filing is the first of an anticipated series of condemnation actions that ultimately would result in the transfer of more than 1440 square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi Tribe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-tribe-closer-to-acquiring-more-land-in-arizona-after-decades-of-delay/7910461.html	2024-12-22T13:18:31-08:00	
Media report: More than 3,100 Native American children died in US boarding schools	Washington — At least 3,104 Native American children died in boarding schools in the United States, taken from their families to be forcibly assimilated, The Washington Post reported on Sunday, with its estimate three times higher than that of the American government. In these establishments, some of which were religious and which existed from the beginning of the 19th century to the 1970s, many children suffered physical, psychological or sexual violence, according to a recent government report which estimated that at least 973 students died there. In late October, U.S. President Joe Biden apologized to Native American peoples, calling the atrocities 'a sin that stains our souls.' According to The Washington Post, which conducted a year-long investigation, 3,104 students lost their lives in these schools between 1828 and 1970, in what the newspaper describes as 'a dark chapter in American history that has long been ignored and largely covered up.' And the toll would actually be much higher according to historians, adds the newspaper. The Washington Post says it has 'determined that more than 800 of these students were buried in or near cemeteries at the schools where they attended, underscoring that, as in many cases, the children's bodies were never returned to their families or tribes.' According to documents seen by the daily, 'The causes of death included infectious diseases, malnutrition and accidents.' Dozens of Native American students have died under suspicious circumstances, the article continues, 'and in some cases, documents show indications of abuse or mistreatment that likely led to the children's deaths.' The boarding schools 'were not schools' but 'prison camps, work camps,' Judi gaiashkibos, director of the Nebraska Commission on Native Americans and whose relatives were sent there, told the newspaper. The Joe Biden administration has implemented a series of measures to support Native American nations and improve relations with the federal state. In the United States, reservations now administered by Native Americans are predominantly poor, with high suicide and overdose rates. In neighboring Canada, where the same practice of residential schools for young indigenous people existed, the country has also opened its eyes in recent years to this dark page of history.	https://www.voanews.com/a/media-report-more-than-3-100-native-american-children-died-in-us-boarding-schools-/7910455.html	2024-12-22T12:59:09-08:00	
Sonic 3' bests 'Mufasa' at box office	New York — In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures' 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' sped past the Walt Disney Co.'s 'Mufasa: The Lion King' to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an 'A' on CinemaScore), 'Sonic 3' is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year. It was telling of some wider trends that 'Sonic 3' — made for $122 million — bested one of Disney's top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous 'Sonic' movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth 'Sonic' movie is already in development. 'Mufasa,' however, was humbled in its opening weekend, with its $35 million in domestic ticket sales coming in notably shy of expectations. The photorealistic 'Lion King' prequel even opened wider than 'Sonic 3,' launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for 'Sonic 3.' Though 'Mufasa's' reviews were poor (56% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave it an 'A-' CinemaScore. 'Sonic 3' nearly doubled the haul for 'Mufasa,' which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third 'Sonic' will roll out in most overseas markets in the coming weeks. In director Jeff Fowler's 'Sonic 3,' Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather. 'Moonlight' filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs 'Mufasa's' voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau's 2019 photorealistic 'The Lion King' remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. 'Mufasa' didn't come close to that film's huge $191 million opening weekend. 'We felt strongly that the marketplace could support both movies and we're certainly holding up our side of the bargain,' said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. No major franchise movie is coming this Christmas. The most anticipated Dec. 25 release might be 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan. That means 'Sonic 3' could be looking at several weeks in a row at No. 1. 'The family audience was 59% on 'Sonic 2.' This time it's 46%. That 13% drop reflects the time of year we're dealing with,' said Aronson. 'I think once the marketplace really cooks, 'Sonic' is going to be the dominant force.' Many of Disney's live-action adaptations – including 'Aladdin,' 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Jungle Book' – have been big hits. Others, such as 'Dumbo,' 'Mulan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new 'Snow White' in March, 'Lilo & Stitch' in May, and plans for 'Moana' and 'Tangled' to get the same live-action treatment. Despite 'Mufasa's' muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year's top two hits: 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool and Wolverine.' The animated 'Moana 2' could give Disney the top three movies of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend. Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this season. That includes 'Moana 2' and Universal Pictures' 'Wicked,' which managed third place in its fifth weekend. 'Wicked,' the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million. Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that's still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it's enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies. Family films like 'Inside Out 2,' 'Moana 2' and 'Sonic 3' have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26.5% of this year's box office. 'The box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,' said Dergarabedian. 'Homestead,' the latest release from Christian-themed Angel Studios, the distributor of 'Sound of Freedom,' opened with $6.1 million. It follows a group of Doomsday preparers who take shelter in a self-sufficient compound after a nuclear attack in California. Brady Corbet's 'The Brutalist,' one of the year's top Oscar contenders, launched on four screens in New York and Los Angeles. Its $66,698 per-screen average was one of the highest of 2024. The post-World War II epic runs three-and-a-half hours, posing obvious theatrical challenges. A24 is trying to turn the film starring Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce into an arthouse event. It was nominated for seven Golden Globes. Final domestic box office figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $62 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $35 million. 3. 'Wicked,' $13.5 million. 4. 'Moana 2,' $13.1 million. 5. 'Homestead,' $6.1 million. 6. 'Gladiator II,' $4.5 million. 7. 'Kraven the Hunter,' $3.1 million. 8. 'Red One,' $1.4 million. 9. 'Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,' $1.3 million. 10. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $825,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sonic-3-bests-mufasa-at-box-office/7910444.html	2024-12-22T12:28:45-08:00	
Saudi Arabia announces resumption of embassy operations in Kabul	Riyadh , Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday the resumption of operations of its diplomatic mission in the Afghan capital, Kabul, more than three years after withdrawing its diplomats from the country amid the chaos that accompanied the Taliban's rise to power. 'Based on the keenness of the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to provide all services to the brotherly Afghan people, it has been decided to resume the activities of the Kingdom's mission in Kabul as of December 22, 2024,' the Saudi embassy in Kabul said on X. The Saudi foreign ministry did not immediately respond to AFP's questions about the level of Saudi representation in Kabul. Saudi Arabia announced on August 15, 2021 that it had withdrawn its diplomats from Kabul due to the 'unstable situation' following the Taliban's return to power following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. In November 2021, Saudi Arabia announced the resumption of consular services in Afghanistan, where the Saudi Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) is providing humanitarian aid. The Taliban government is not recognized by any country. Saudi Arabia is one of three countries, along with the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, to recognize the former Taliban government, which was overthrown in the U.S. invasion in 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-arabia-announces-resumption-of-embassy-operations-in-kabul/7910445.html	2024-12-22T12:26:37-08:00

Colombia's ELN rebels announce Christmas truce	BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombia's largest remaining rebel group announced a unilateral truce on Sunday, to last until Jan. 3, the first since the previous ceasefire broke down in August. In a statement posted on X, the National Liberation Army said that it will halt attacks on the military as the nation celebrates Christmas and New Year's. Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared the truce announcement on his X account, with a message saying that 'the end of war, is the nation's goal for 2025.' The group, known in Spanish as the ELN, was founded in the 1960s by university students, priests and union leaders inspired by the Cuban revolution. It currently has 6,000 fighters in Colombia and Venezuela according to Ministry of Defense estimates, and finances itself through illegal mining, extortion rackets and the drug trade. The ELN has increased its influence in some rural areas of Colombia by stepping into a power vacuum left by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia after that group signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016. Two years ago, the ELN began to stage peace talks of its own with the Petro administration, which resulted in a ceasefire that began in August of last year. But peace talks stalled due to disagreements over when the ELN would stop kidnapping and taxing civilians. ELN commanders were also angered by the government's move to set up separate negotiations with an ELN offshoot in the southwest of the country. The ceasefire broke down four months ago, and since then the ELN has stepped up its attacks on military targets and oil infrastructure along Colombia's border with Venezuela. The Petro administration has attempted to stage peace talks with several armed groups in rural pockets of the country, under a strategy known as total peace. ELN commanders have criticized the Petro administration for trying to cut deals with some of these groups, instead of persecuting them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-s-eln-rebels-announce-christmas-truce/7910383.html	2024-12-22T10:21:53-08:00	
Putin meets Slovak PM Fico at Kremlin	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks at the Kremlin on Sunday with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, one of the few European leaders he has stayed friendly with since the eruption of hostilities with Ukraine, according to Russian television. 'Putin is currently holding talks in the Kremlin with Slovak Prime Minister Fico,' Russian TV journalist Pavel Zarubin, a Kremlin insider, posted on his Telegram channel, along with a short video showing the two leaders. The visit by Fico, whose country is both a NATO and European Union member, had not been previously announced. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told Zarubin however that it had been arranged 'a few days ago.' Peskov did not give details of the talks but said it could be 'presumed' that supplies of Russian gas would be discussed. Ukraine announced this year that it would not renew a contract allowing the transit of Russian gas through its territory that runs out on December 31. Slovakia and Hungary, which rely on Russian gas, have raised concerns about the prospect of losing supplies. Fico ended military aid to Ukraine when he became prime minister again in October 2023, and like Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban has called for peace talks. Fico announced in November that he would go to Moscow in May for ceremonies to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-meets-slovak-pm-fico-at-kremlin-/7910378.html	2024-12-22T10:19:55-08:00	
Pakistan’s political climate shaken by pro-Khan tweets from Trump’s choice for special missions envoy	Islamabad — Richard Grenell, a close confidant of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has garnered substantial media and political attention in Pakistan due to his persistent social media posts advocating for the release of the country’s former prime minister, Imran Khan. The situation escalated on November 26 when the Pakistani government unleashed a violent crackdown in Islamabad to disperse opposition protesters who were demanding Khan’s release. This prompted Grenell to express his support on the social media platform X, tweeting, 'Free Imran Khan!' Although his initial post received limited attention, it was amplified by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party and its supporters on December 15, when Trump appointed Grenell as his special envoy for global missions in the incoming administration. Pakistan’s prominent Geo News channel, often accused of serving as a mouthpiece for the country’s military establishment, responded to Grenell’s selection with a headline on X reading, 'Trump appoints homosexual Richard Grenell as special envoy.' In response, the U.S. envoy-designate reiterated his message by stating, 'I’ll say it again. Free Imran Khan,' and noted in a subsequent post that his previous tweet had garnered 10 million views. Grenell has held several prominent positions, including U.S. ambassador to Germany, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and acting director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration from 2017 to 2021. His pro-Khan tweets have led to speculation regarding their potential implications for Pakistan's political landscape. Commentators on Pakistani television talk shows have addressed Grenell’s tweets, with some dismissing his social media engagement as mere publicity-seeking endeavors while others cautioning that it could eventually influence the new administration’s interactions with Islamabad. Some critics in Pakistan even questioned the authenticity of his X account. Grenell promptly responded to the skepticism by tweeting, 'How do I even prove I’m real?' He issued his latest pro-Khan tweet on Saturday in response to concerns Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin expressed on X about the deadly opposition protests in the Pakistani capital last month. 'Pakistani authorities must protect citizens’ rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, hold violators accountable, and uphold Pakistan’s democracy,' Slotkin wrote. Khan, viewed as the most popular Pakistani politician, has been imprisoned since August 2023 on various charges, including corruption and treason. He contends that the legal proceedings against him are politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power due to his vocal criticisms of military involvement in civilian governance. The coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, believed to have military backing, disputes these allegations, encouraging Khan to prove his innocence in court rather than leveling what it calls baseless charges. Khan and independent analysts maintain that his PTI party would have won a significant majority in the February 2024 parliamentary election if not for alleged electoral rigging facilitated by the military to pave the way for Sharif’s party to form the government. PTI candidates and supporters faced state-sponsored crackdowns leading up to the polls, forcing key party leaders and candidates into hiding and rounding up hundreds of others, which critics said effectively undermined their election campaign. During his tenure from 2018 to 2022, Khan and his government played a key role in facilitating peace talks between the then-Trump administration and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan, ultimately contributing to the withdrawal of U.S. troops in August 2021. Khan issued a statement from prison through his X account following Trump’s election victory last month, expressing congratulations on behalf of himself and his party. 'President-Elect Trump will be good for Pak-US relations based on mutual respect for democracy & human rights. We hope he will push for peace, human rights, and democracy globally,' the former Pakistani leader stated. Khan’s critics, including the Sharif government, have criticized him and his party for seeking U.S. intervention in domestic politics, recalling his consistent opposition to any external interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs. The former prime minister was ousted through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. Khan rejected the vote as illegal, saying it was orchestrated by the Pakistani military at the behest of the United States, charges army officials and Washington denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-political-climate-shaken-by-pro-khan-tweets-from-trump-s-choice-for-special-missions-envoy-/7910337.html	2024-12-22T09:42:13-08:00	
Trump taps ex-Treasury official Miran as chair of Council of Economic Advisers	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Stephen Miran, a Treasury Department adviser in his first administration, would be the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. The council advises the president on economic policy and is composed of three members, including the chair. The council assists in the preparation of an annual report that gives an overview of the country's economy, reviews federal policies and programs and makes economic policy recommendations. Earlier this year, Miran and economist Nouriel Roubini authored a hedge fund study that said the U.S. Treasury last year effectively provided economic stimulus by moderating long-dated bond sales. The study echoed suggestions by Republican lawmakers that the Treasury deliberately increased issuance of short-term Treasury bills to give the economy a 'sugar high' ahead of the November elections. The Treasury denied any such strategy. Miran, a senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, has also argued that fears over trade tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose after he takes office next month are overblown. Trade and economic experts have said such duties would raise prices and would effectively be a new tax on consumers. Last month, Trump tapped Kevin Hassett, who was a key economic adviser in his first term, to chair his National Economic Council, which helps set domestic and international economic policy. Hudson Bay Capital took a position in Trump's social media firm Trump Media & Technology in the first quarter of this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-ex-treasury-official-miran-as-chair-of-council-of-economic-advisers-/7910314.html	2024-12-22T09:04:36-08:00	
Thousands protest in Serbian capital over fatal train station accident	Belgrade — Thousands protested Sunday in Serbia's capital Belgrade to demand that leaders take responsibility for the collapse of a train station roof that killed 15 people last month. For over seven weeks, the Serbian government has been under pressure from nation-wide demonstrations following the deaths in the northern city of Novi Sad, with many protesters accusing authorities of corruption and inadequate oversight. Sunday's protest organized by university students started with 15-minutes of silence as tribute to the 15 victims in the incident. The demonstration occupied Slavija square, a key roundabout, snarling traffic in the city center. 'The state is children's property' and 'Protests are exams' read some of the banners of the demonstrators who have demanded that the prime minister and the Novi Sad mayor resign, and that those found responsible be prosecuted. Farmers, actors and other citizens from across Serbia have come to support the students. Students have also called for legal proceedings to be dropped against demonstrators, and for the prosecution of assailants who have attacked the protesters. In a bid to dilute the anger and calm the protests, the authorities over the past weeks have promised various subsidies for young people. On Friday, the government announced plans to close schools early for winter holidays. Students continued to protest, saying their demands have only been partially met. Fourteen people, aged between six and 74, were killed on November 1 when the roof collapsed after major renovation works on the station. A 15th victim died in hospital weeks later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-in-serbian-capital-over-fatal-train-station-accident/7910317.html	2024-12-22T09:01:31-08:00	
At least 9 dead in Brazil plane crash, authorities say	Sao Paulo, Brazil — At least nine people died when a small plane crashed on Sunday morning in Gramado, in southern Brazil, authorities said, slamming into a commercial area of the tourist city. The aircraft crashed into the chimney of a building, struck the second floor of a house and then 'fell on a furniture store,' the Rio Grande do Sul state security secretariat said in a statement. An inn was also damaged, it added. 'There are nine deaths confirmed by the civil defense, and there are no survivors of the plane,' Cleber dos Santos Lima, director of the Interior Police Department of the state civil police, told AFP. Authorities have not yet confirmed how many passengers and crew were traveling on the plane, a Piper Cheyenne 400 turboprop, but earlier said they thought it was carrying 10 people. At least 15 people were taken to the hospital, most for smoke inhalation from the fire caused by the crash. The plane had taken off from the municipality of Canela, another tourist town in Rio Grande do Sul. Gramado is a popular tourist city in Brazil, with a significant influx of visitors during the Christmas season.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-9-dead-in-brazil-plane-crash-authorities-say/7910302.html	2024-12-22T08:51:13-08:00

Italy's Meloni says security threat posed by Russia is far-reaching	SAARISELKA, Finland — Russia poses a bigger threat to European Union security than just defense as Moscow can use illegal immigration and other issues to undermine the bloc, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Sunday. Finland hosted the leaders of Italy, Sweden and Greece, as well as the EU foreign affairs chief, in its northern Lapland region at the weekend to discuss security in the Nordic region and the Mediterranean, as well as migration challenges in southern Europe. 'We have to understand the threat is much wider than we imagine,' Meloni, who leads a conservative government, told a press conference when asked about Russia. The danger to EU security from Russia or from elsewhere would not stop once the Ukraine conflict ended and the EU must be prepared for that, she said. 'It's about our democracy, it's about influencing our public opinion, it's about what happens in Africa, it's about raw materials, it's about the instrumentalization of migration. We need to know it's a very wide idea of security,' Meloni said. She urged the EU to do more to protect its borders and not let Russia or any 'criminal organization' steer the flows of illegal migrants. Some EU members, including Finland and Estonia, have accused Russia of allowing illegal migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to enter EU states via Russia without proper checks, undermining the EU's security. Moscow has denied Russia was deliberately pushing illegal migrants into the EU. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said securing his country's 1,340-km border with Russia was 'an existential' question for Finland and for other EU members and NATO allies. Meloni said the EU had been wrong in dealing with the issue of immigration over the years simply in terms of how to share the burden. 'Tackling the issue of illegal immigration solely as a solidarity-based debate was a mistake,' she said. 'The result is that we have been unable to protect our borders. ... We want to defend our external borders and we will not allow Russia or criminal organizations to undermine our security.' While NATO remained 'the cornerstone' of EU security, the bloc had to tackle wider challenges, Meloni said. 'Security also means critical infrastructure, it means artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, raw materials, supply chains. It means a new and more effective foreign and cooperation policy, it means migration,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-meloni-says-security-threat-posed-by-russia-is-far-reaching-/7910119.html	2024-12-22T04:07:02-08:00	
China takes steps against Canada institutions, individuals over Uyghurs, Tibet	BEIJING — China said on Sunday it was taking countermeasures against two Canadian institutions and 20 people involved in human rights issues concerning the Uyghurs and Tibet. The measures, which took effect on Saturday, include asset freezes and bans on entry and the targets include Canada's Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project and the Canada-Tibet Committee, China's foreign ministry announced on its website. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of Uyghurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority that numbers around 10 million in the western region of Xinjiang, including the mass use of forced labor in camps. Beijing denies any abuses. China seized control of Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a 'peaceful liberation' from feudalistic serfdom. International human rights groups and exiles, however, have routinely condemned what they call China's oppressive rule in Tibetan areas. For the two institutions, China said it is freezing their 'movable property, immovable property and other types of property within the territory of China.' It is freezing the property in China of 15 people in the Uyghur institution and five on the Tibet committee, banning them from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macao. Calls to the Canadian Embassy in Beijing went unanswered. Reuters did not receive an immediate response from the rights groups or Global Affairs Canada.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-takes-steps-against-canada-institutions-individuals-over-uyghurs-tibet-/7910112.html	2024-12-22T03:46:55-08:00	
German police say Christmas market attack killed 4 women and a boy	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY — More details emerged Sunday about those killed when a man drove a car at speed through a Christmas market in Germany, while mourners continued to place flowers and other tributes at the site of the attack. Police in Magdeburg, the central city where the attack took place on Friday evening, said that the victims were four women ranging in age from 45 to 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy they had spoken of a day earlier. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers west of Berlin, and beyond. Authorities have identified the suspect in the Magdeburg attack as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Saturday evening, the suspect was brought before a judge, who ordered behind closed doors that he be kept in custody pending a possible indictment. Police haven't publicly named the suspect, but several German news outlets identified him as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect appears to have been an active user of the social media platform X, sharing dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who had left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he referred to as the 'Islamification of Europe.' The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany make it likely that migration will remain a key issue as German heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. The far-right Alternative for Germany party had already been polling strongly amid a societal backlash against the large numbers of refugees and migrants who have arrived in Germany over the past decade. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union's migration policies. At an annual news conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orban insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' Orban vowed to 'fight back' against the EU migration policies 'because Brussels wants Magdeburg to happen to Hungary, too.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-say-christmas-market-attack-killed-4-women-and-a-boy/7910099.html	2024-12-22T02:24:10-08:00	
Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 16, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA STRIP — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 16 people, Palestinian medical officials said. A strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City killed at least six people, including four children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on Hamas militants sheltering there. A strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight people, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. A further two people were killed in a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday, just after midnight, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital. There was no immediate comment from the military on those strikes. Israel has continued to carry out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Israel's subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 people in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. The Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from the Kamal Adwan Hospital and the Awda Hospital in the far north, which have struggled to function. COGAT said it had also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals. Israeli authorities also allowed Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, to enter Gaza and celebrate a pre-Christmas Mass with members of the territory's small Christian community. The Latin Patriarchate confirmed the visit in a brief statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-kill-at-least-16-palestinian-officials-say/7910081.html	2024-12-22T01:03:52-08:00	
What Assad's fall has revealed about Syria's trade in stimulant drug Captagon	BEIRUT — Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug. Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018. 'Assad's collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,' Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. 'They came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn't burn everything.' 'From here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,' Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site. Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream. The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations — revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad's power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry. How did Syria build its Captagon empire? Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties. Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue. Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria's economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it. Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs. The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-19 as the Assad regime — and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon. Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank. Evidence of the Assad regime's sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad's brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added. Where and how was Captagon smuggled? Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection. The primary smuggling routes were Syria's porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group. Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products. Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. How much revenue did it produce for the Assad regime? The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project. 'Seeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,' said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids. The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed 'the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.' The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country. Captagon as a narco-diplomatic tool While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited. Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad's brutal crackdown on protesters. Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee. Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin's home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad's consent. The future of Captagon in post-Assad Syria Assad has turned Syria into 'the largest Captagon factory in the world,' HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus's Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. 'Today, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.' While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say. 'Likely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,' Rose said. They may also 'seek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,' she said. In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should 'establish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country's formal, licit economic sphere,' Rose said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-assad-s-fall-has-revealed-about-syria-s-trade-in-stimulant-drug-captagon-/7909379.html	2024-12-21T23:52:39-08:00	
It's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in US	Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S. The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 80 kilometers from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports. Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year. What will be the busiest travel days? Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through Jan. 2. About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. 'Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,' AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said. Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was about $.99 a liter, down from $1 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state. Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company. Weather and other wildcards Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions. That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have 'interline agreements' that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights. This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them. Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive. 'When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,' said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet. People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight. 'They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,' and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said. Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard. Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page. Planning ahead for 2025 Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations. 'Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,' Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. 'If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/it-s-beginning-to-look-like-another-record-for-holiday-travel-in-us-/7909375.html	2024-12-21T23:52:02-08:00	
Survey: Most US teens are abstaining from drinking, smoking and marijuana	NEW YORK — Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday. About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn't used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That's the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017. Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn't used any of those substances recently, another record. Among eighth graders, 90% didn't use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey. The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they'd used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023. Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan's Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: 'It's hard to know if we're seeing the start of something, or not.' The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year's findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades eight, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is 'one of the best, if not the best' source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use. Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say. As lockdowns ended, 'I think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,' Miech said. Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances. But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too. Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence. Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said. 'The pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,' Miech said. Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids. 'Some teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,' Clark said. 'It's a complicated relationship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/survey-most-us-teens-are-abstaining-from-drinking-smoking-and-marijuana/7908093.html	2024-12-21T23:50:44-08:00	
Once overlooked, Brazilian caramel-colored stray dogs having a major moment	SAO PAULO — For decades, they have scrounged for food on streets across the country — undesired, abandoned and overlooked. But today, the caramel-colored mutts of Brazil are having a major moment. The 'vira-lata caramelo' (literally: caramel trashcan-tipper) is being exalted in memes, videos, petitions, an upcoming Netflix film, a Carnival parade and draft legislation to honor it as part of Brazilian culture. Caramelos' newfound cachet speaks to the value of resilience in Brazil — a melting pot of 213 million people known for weathering hard knocks with a smile — and inverts its supposed 'mongrel complex.' A scene from Netflix's Caramelo shot in October featured a beige puppy sitting beside a river in Sao Paulo watching picture-perfect families pass with their impeccable purebreds — a golden retriever, a miniature collie and a Doberman. At the director of photography's signal, a delivery boy cycled past and the plucky mutt gave chase, following the scent of pizza and seeking a way to get by. 'The caramelo ended up becoming the great symbol of Brazil, a symbol for the people,' Diego Freitas, the film's director and co-writer, said after the day's shooting. 'Netflix was sensitive to what's happening with the zeitgeist. The caramelo is the spirit of our time.' Caramelos escape from the internet The caramelo craze started online around 2019. People posted the tongue-in-cheek phrase, 'This represents Brazil more than soccer or samba,' along with photos of distinctively Brazilian phenomena, including caramelos galore. Social media accounts paid tribute to the caramelos' antics: One invaded a dance show and relieved itself on stage; another played dead while receiving chest compressions for a CPR training video. Online retailers started hawking caramelo-shaped throw pillows. A petition to replace the macaw on Brazil's 10-reais ($1.65) bill garnered 50,000 signatures in 2019. 'The caramelo has established itself as a landmark of the Brazilian people, being well loved and received in all states of the country, being an excellent representative of our culture,' it proclaimed. 'Therefore it deserves mention on our currency.' The next year, another petition to emblazon the medium-sized dog on the 200-reais note received triple the support. Many cite kindness as the caramelos' secret charm, but more often say it's that they're savvy survivors. Case in point is a caramelo in the northeastern city Joao Pessoa. Last year, Khelson Silva, 59, left the gym with a friend and found the stray waiting. It took Silva's friend's finger gingerly between its teeth and led them for three blocks. 'He got to my building, walked straight into the garage, went up the elevator and right into the house,' said Silva, who learned this caramelo, now named Persistent José, had attempted similar gambits before. 'It was him who chose us. He knew where we lived.' The 'crazy mixture' of Brazil Writer Nelson Rodrigues coined the now-infamous term 'mongrel complex' after the national soccer team's humiliating World Cup defeat in 1950, aiming to encapsulate what he perceived as Brazil's sense of inferiority compared to other nations. Today, many see Brazil's diverse roots — immigrants, enslaved Africans and Indigenous people — as a source of pride. Tina Castro, an English teacher in Rio de Janeiro, equates owning a caramelo with loving the 'crazy mixture' of Brazil and its people. 'It comes from a marginal place, like Brazil. It has a history of survival and marginalization,' said Castro, 32. 'We value the caramelo in the way we value our country, as it is.' 'Caramelos will dominate the world!' has become a jokey rallying cry online, and foreign allies are lending a hand. After touring Brazil in November, singer Bruno Mars posed with a caramelo in his viral farewell video. Staff of the British mission to Brazil overwhelmingly voted in July to christen their new digital mascot, a Welsh Corgi, 'Lord Caramelo.' 'The caramelo, a national icon' The budget for Netflix's Caramelo is part of 1 billion reais ($164 million) spent from 2023-24 on Brazilian productions to capture eyeballs in one of the world's biggest video streaming markets. Netflix hasn't set a release date. 'The movie is a big bet for Netflix, a superproduction,' Netflix Brasil's press office told The Associated Press. 'It's the first Brazilian film with a dog as a protagonist, and it couldn't be any other than the caramelo, a national icon.' Others catapulting the caramelo into the spotlight include Rio's Sao Clemente samba school. At its three-story workshop downtown on Nov. 28, seamstresses churned out strips of sheer yellow fabric for dozens of towering caramelo costumes. Each will feature a giant foam head in the school's 2025 Carnival parade, whose theme is animal abandonment and abuse. 'It's our starlet,' gushed workshop director Roberto Gomes. 'The caramelo is the beautiful, likeable little dog — not the purebred. It's the cutie, that dog that's always funny, always in our hearts.' A few blocks away, Lt. Col. Sidnei Robson Pazini says Brazilians are merely rediscovering long-lost devotion. He directs the Rio military police's museum and archive, and says the 'most iconic, most emblematic' piece — more than the muskets, cannon or painting worth almost $1 million — is a taxidermied caramelo that's about 150 years old. The dog often visited a Rio police battalion for food — earning the name Bruto — then joined officers shipping off to war in Paraguay, despite efforts to stop him boarding. Bruto alerted troops to approaching enemies, signaled where soldiers needed rescue and, after surviving a gunshot, returned to Rio a hero. When he died, police took up a collection to have him stuffed, with a silver collar bearing the words 'Constancy, Love and Fidelity.' Street dogs still find succor inside police battalions. One in Rio adopted a caramelo in 2018 and gave him the rank of corporal. At a ceremony in July, he was promoted to sergeant. Famous but homeless, caramelos still need help Amid this caramelo hype, one might think Brazilians would be jostling to adopt their own. But volunteers at two shelters told the AP they still get passed over for smaller, fluffier or whiter dogs. The Indefesos shelter in Rio had 217 dogs on Dec. 12 — about half caramelos. One clambers over a 6-foot wall to welcome visitors, his favorite ball in his mouth. Whenever Indefesos receives a litter with caramelos, volunteers scramble to post Instagram photos. Caramelo puppies are inevitably picked last. 'It's absurd. We rush because we know that animal, when it grows up, will never have the chance for a home,' said Rosana Guerra, the nonprofit's president. 'They end up staying, waiting for adoption that never comes.' In the Netflix film, the stray scampers into the hectic life of a career-driven chef and helps him find meaning in the present. Freitas, the director, said he aims for it to touch Brazilians' hearts and transform caramelo affinity into action. The puppy that pursued the delivery boy that gray October day had been found in a box beside a highway with its nine siblings. Four play the young version of the film's 1-year-old star that was also a stray. Since filming wrapped Nov. 26, six of the film's once-homeless canines were adopted by crew members and others. 'It's a story that I hope is worthy of the dogs, because they are incredible,' Freitas said, with his own caramelo — the film's inspiration — at his feet. 'They change our lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/once-overlooked-brazilian-caramel-colored-stray-dogs-having-a-major-moment/7906739.html	2024-12-21T23:48:51-08:00	
Nuclear bunker sales increase, despite expert warnings	When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn't hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes. 'The world's not becoming a safer place,' he said. 'We wanted to be prepared.' Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there's a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source. With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California's Inland Empire. 'If there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you'd go there too,' said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago. Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside to extravagant underground mansions. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren't focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren't necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA. But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include 'the rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.' Building bunkers 'People are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it's better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,' said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world's largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales. On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia's first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop. Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building. Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters. 'They're good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,' he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction. A loaded shotgun at arm's length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices — $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 — and installations — they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker. Under Hubbard's doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through. 'The good news about nuclear warfare,' he said, 'if there ever was any, that it's very survivable if you're not killed in the initial blast.' He's not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts. 'You want to go to your most robust building' 'Look, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,' said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. 'There's going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.' Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans — who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills — educated about how to respond. After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 'It's going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you're going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,' he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating. The government's efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic. The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: 'BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.' For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what 'seek immediate shelter' actually meant. Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next. 'Gently brush your pet's coat to remove any fallout particles' it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows 'enough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.' Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said 'the scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.' If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives. 'Underground bunkers aren't going to protect people' Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable. 'Bunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,' said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Sanders-Zakre called radiation the 'uniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,' and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn't prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. 'Ultimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.' Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago. 'The political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,' he said. 'That's something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.' Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term. 'Even if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,' he said. 'The fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.' That's been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years. 'If we ever get to a point where there's all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren't going to protect people,' he said. 'Instead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.' Next, he said, 'we should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.' Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he's disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal. 'The stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.' McGovern pushed back against FEMA's efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter. 'What a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that's chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,' he said. Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker. This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons. The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren't particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven't spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there. 'We have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,' the husband said. 'It does provide a sense of security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nuclear-bunker-sales-increase-despite-expert-warnings-/7906658.html	2024-12-21T23:48:20-08:00	
US says 2 Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fire' incident	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military's Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis did not acknowledge the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel's grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-2-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-apparent-friendly-fire-incident/7910062.html	2024-12-21T20:16:30-08:00	
Trump threatens to take back control of Panama Canal	WASHINGTON — Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for U.S. ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington. He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as U.S. businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 'Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous,' he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop.' The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Panama took full control in 1999. 'It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,' Trump said. 'We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!' He continued that if Panama could not ensure 'the secure, efficient and reliable operation' of the channel, 'then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question.' Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post. Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration. The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for U.S. business interests. An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America. The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly $5 billion in the last fiscal year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-to-take-back-control-of-panama-canal/7910058.html	2024-12-21T19:35:35-08:00	
France supports Ethiopia’s quest for sea access through discussion	ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — French President Emmanuel Macron said his country supports Ethiopia’s quest for access to the sea through discussion and respecting international laws and neighboring countries. Macron spoke on Saturday after a one-day visit to Addis Ababa, where he held bilateral talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. During a news conference, Macron welcomed the Ankara Declaration reached by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Federal Republic of Somalia on Dec. 11. In the declaration, brokered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 'the leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia reaffirmed their respect and commitment to one another’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity, as well as the principles enshrined in international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutive Act of the African Union.' The two sides also agreed to start 'technical negotiations' by February on details of Ethiopia's sea access, and that those negotiations would be facilitated by Turkey and be 'concluded and signed' within four months. The breakthrough came after an almost yearlong dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia that began Jan. 1 when Somaliland’s former president, Muse Bihi Abdi, and Ethiopia’s Abiy signed a memorandum of understanding to lease 20 kilometers of Somaliland seafront to Ethiopia for 50 years, in return for diplomatic recognition. The Somali government rejected the deal and accused Ethiopia of a 'blatant violation' of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. On Saturday, President Macron expressed his readiness to support Ethiopia's legitimate quest for sea access. He said France is interested in playing its part in facilitating ways in which sea access can be achieved responsibly through talks, in a way that recognizes international laws and respects neighboring countries. Abiy said the two leaders have thoroughly discussed his country's pursuit of peaceful access to the Red Sea. He said the French president accepted Ethiopia's request for support in its quest for sea access through international law, peacefully and diplomatically. 'The ties between our two nations continue to be strengthened and I look forward to our discussions during his stay in Ethiopia,' Abiy said of Macron in a post on X. Macron also touched on a domestic issue in Ethiopia: the implementation of the Pretoria agreement signed in November 2022 by Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front that ended a deadly two-year war. Macron said France is keen to support those affected by the conflict and would like to see the rule of law upheld through the transitional justice process. Abiy and Macron also toured Ethiopia’s newly renovated National Palace in Addis Ababa, the former home of emperor Haile Selassie that was restored with the help of 25 million euros provided by the French Development Agency. The Ethiopian government plans to open it to the public as a museum. French architects and other professionals have also participated in the renovation process, Macron said. According to Macron, France is also providing funding and technical support for ongoing renovation at the Rock-Hewn Churches at Lalibela in the Amhara region. The site was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage list in 1978. It’s the second time Macron has visited Ethiopia in six years. Before traveling to Ethiopia, Macron visited the cyclone-hit Indian Ocean island of Mayotte, where residents demanded more support in light of the cyclone that devastated the island and claimed dozens of lives. Macron also stopped by Djibouti, which hosts the largest French military base in the continent, where he dined with his troops. After meeting with President Ismail Omar Guelleh, Macron described relations with Djibouti as a solid, deep-rooted and forward-looking partnership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-supports-ethiopia-s-quest-for-sea-access-through-discussion/7910045.html	2024-12-21T18:54:02-08:00	
Former Syrian soldiers seek amnesty, return to civilian life	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Hundreds of former Syrian soldiers on Saturday reported to the country's new rulers for the first time since Bashar al-Assad was ousted to answer questions about whether they may have been involved in crimes against civilians in exchange for a promised amnesty and return to civilian life. The former soldiers trooped to what used to be the head office in Damascus of Assad's Baath party that had ruled Syria for six decades. They were met with interrogators, former insurgents who stormed Damascus on December 8, and given a list of questions and a registration number. They were free to leave. Some members of the defunct military and security services waiting outside the building told The Associated Press that they had joined Assad's forces because it meant a stable monthly income and free medical care. The fall of Assad took many by surprise as tens of thousands of soldiers and members of security services failed to stop the advancing insurgents. Now in control of the country, and Assad in exile in Russia, the new authorities are investigating atrocities by Assad's forces, mass graves and an array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions. Lieutenant Colonel Walid Abd Rabbo, who works with the new Interior Ministry, said the army has been dissolved and the interim government has not decided yet whether those 'whose hands are not tainted in blood' can apply to join the military again. The new leaders have vowed to punish those responsible for crimes against Syrians under Assad. Several locations for the interrogation and registration of former soldiers were opened in other parts of Syria in recent days. 'Today I am coming for the reconciliation and don't know what will happen next,' said Abdul-Rahman Ali, 43, who last served in the northern city of Aleppo until it was captured by insurgents in early December. 'We received orders to leave everything and withdraw,' he said. 'I dropped my weapon and put on civilian clothes,' he said, adding that he walked 14 hours until he reached the central town of Salamiyeh, from where he took a bus to Damascus. Ali, who was making about $45 a month in Assad's army, said he would serve his country again. Inside the building, men stood in short lines in front of four rooms where interrogators asked each a list of questions on a paper. 'I see regret in their eyes,' an interrogator told AP as he questioned a soldier who now works at a shawarma restaurant in the Damascus suburb of Harasta. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk to the media. The interrogator asked the soldier where his rifle was, and the man responded that he left it at the base where he served. He then asked for and was handed the soldier's military ID. 'He has become a civilian,' the interrogator said, adding that the authorities will carry out their own investigation before questioning the same soldier again within weeks to make sure there are no changes in the answers that he gave on Saturday. The interrogator said after nearly two hours that he had quizzed 20 soldiers, and the numbers are expected to increase in the coming days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-syrian-soldiers-seek-amnesty-return-to-civilian-life-/7910051.html	2024-12-21T18:26:50-08:00	
Syria's new rulers appoint defense, foreign ministers	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's new rulers have appointed Murhaf Abu Qasra, a leading figure in the insurgency that toppled Bashar al-Assad, as defense minister in the interim government, an official source said on Saturday. Abu Qasra, who is also known by the nom de guerre Abu Hassan 600, is a senior figure in the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led the campaign that ousted Assad this month. He led numerous military operations during Syria's revolution, the source said. Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa discussed 'the form of the military institution in the new Syria' during a meeting with armed factions on Saturday, state news agency SANA reported. Abu Qasra during the meeting sat next to Sharaa, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, photos published by SANA showed. Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said this week that the defense ministry would be restructured using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad's army. Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated administration in the northwestern province of Idlib, has said he will lead a three-month transitional government. The new administration has not declared plans for what will happen after that. Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' Shibani, a 37-year-old graduate of Damascus University, previously led the political department of the rebels' Idlib government, the General Command said. Sharaa's group was part of al-Qaida until he broke ties in 2016. It had been confined to Idlib for years until going on the offensive in late November, sweeping through the cities of western Syria and into Damascus as the army melted away. Sharaa has met with a number of international envoys this week. He has said his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development and that he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on December 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family's decades-long rule. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al-Qaida in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic law in Syria. U.S. officials said on Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-rulers-appoint-defense-foreign-ministers-/7910040.html	2024-12-21T17:34:15-08:00	
Trump taps 'Apprentice' producer as special envoy to United Kingdom	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with The Apprentice, is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump announced Saturday. Burnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like Survivor and The Voice, but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for The Apprentice, which first aired on NBC in 2004. Trump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name. Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. The selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both, including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend, and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. Trump's first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on The Apprentice and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a 'star.' Almost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump's television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building's lobby. 'Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,' Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits including, 'most notably, The Apprentice' and noting that Burnett 'has won 13 Emmy Awards!' Special envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East, where Trump has said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a 'special relationship' with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. But Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of his inauguration on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The president-elect said Burnett 'will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-apprentice-producer-as-special-envoy-to-united-kingdom/7910042.html	2024-12-21T17:19:33-08:00	
Stolen base king Rickey Henderson dies at 65	OAKLAND, Calif. — Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65. Henderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were 'shocked and heartbroken by his passing,' but did not specify a cause of death. Known as baseball's 'Man of Steal,' Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award. But it was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other. He broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with the Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed, playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall. He broke Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland. He famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: 'Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time.' Henderson finished his career with 1,406 steals, a 468-steal edge over Brock. Henderson said in September he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career. 'If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt,' he said. Henderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, 'If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody.' That was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the New York Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field. Henderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda. Henderson was the rare position player who batted from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique. He batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs as he eyed the pitcher and the next base. Born on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California, where he could have played eventually with football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen. But Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient. 'She didn’t want her baby to get hurt,' Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. 'I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/stolen-base-king-rickey-henderson-dies-at-65/7910038.html	2024-12-21T17:11:21-08:00	
Quake strikes near battered Vanuatu; no major damage reported	SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — A magnitude 6.1 earthquake rattled buildings on Vanuatu's main island early Sunday but did not appear to have caused major damage, just days after a massive, deadly quake wreaked havoc on the Pacific archipelago. The nation's most populous island, Efate, is still reeling from the 7.3-magnitude quake that struck Tuesday. It killed 12 people as it toppled concrete buildings in the capital, Port Vila, and set off landslides. The quake on Sunday occurred at a depth of 40 kilometers and was located about 30 km west of the capital. Unlike the earlier quake, no tsunami alerts were triggered when it struck at 2:30 a.m. local time. Port Vila businessman Michael Thompson told AFP the quake woke up his family. 'It gave a better bit of a shake, and the windows rattled a little bit, it would have caused houses to rattle,' he said. 'I'd describe this one as one of the bigger aftershocks, and we've had a fair few of them now,' he added. Thompson said there was no sign of further damage in his immediate vicinity. Mobile networks remained knocked out from earlier in the week, making outside contact with Vanuatu difficult. In addition to disrupting communications, the first quake damaged water supplies and stopped operations at the capital's main shipping port. The South Pacific nation declared a seven-day state of emergency and a nighttime curfew following the first quake. It announced on Saturday that it would begin to allow commercial flights in an effort to restart its vital tourism industry, which accounts for about a third of the economy. On Friday, rescuers said they had expanded their search for trapped survivors to 'numerous places of collapse' beyond the capital. Australia and New Zealand this week dispatched more than 100 people, along with rescue gear, dogs and aid supplies, to help hunt for trapped survivors and make emergency repairs. There were 'several major collapse sites where buildings are fully pancaked,' Australia's rescue team leader Douglas May said in a video update on Friday. 'We're now starting to spread out to see whether there's further people trapped and further damage. And we've found numerous places of collapse east and west out of the city.' More than 1,000 people were displaced as a result of the first quake, many now with other households or in evacuation centers, the latest United Nations report said, citing Vanuatu disaster management officials. Thompson said power had been restored to his home on Saturday but said many others were still waiting. 'We're hearing a lot of the major businesses are still down, supermarkets are trying to open back up,' he said. Vanuatu, an archipelago of about 320,000 inhabitants, sits in the Pacific's quake-prone Ring of Fire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-quake-strikes-off-battered-vanuatu-no-major-damage-reported-/7910033.html	2024-12-21T16:57:02-08:00	
Albania to shut down TikTok for 1 year, says platform promotes violence among children	TIRANA, ALBANIA — Albania's prime minister said Saturday the government will shut down the video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. Albanian authorities held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents following the stabbing death of a teenager in mid-November by another teen after a quarrel that started on TikTok. Prime Minister Edi Rama, speaking at a meeting with teachers and parents, said TikTok 'would be fully closed for all. ... There will be no TikTok in the Republic of Albania.' Rama said the shutdown would begin sometime next year. It was not immediately clear if TikTok has a representative in Albania. In an email response Saturday to a request for comment, TikTok asked for 'urgent clarity from the Albanian government' on the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had 'found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.' Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. There has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok. TikTok's operations in China, where its parent company is based, are different, 'promoting how to better study, how to preserve nature ... and so on,' according to Rama. Albania is too small a country to impose on TikTok a change of its algorithm so that it does not promote 'the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on,' Rama's office wrote in an email response to The Associated Press' request for comment. Rama's office said that in China TikTok 'prevents children from being sucked into this abyss.' Authorities have set up a series of protective measures at schools, starting with an increased police presence, training programs and closer cooperation with parents. Rama said Albania would follow how the company and other countries react to the one-year shutdown before deciding whether to allow the company to resume operations in Albania. Not everyone agreed with Rama's decision to close TikTok. 'The dictatorial decision to close the social media platform TikTok ... is a grave act against freedom of speech and democracy,' said Ina Zhupa, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party. 'It is a pure electoral act and abuse of power to suppress freedoms.' Albania holds parliamentary elections next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albania-to-shut-down-tiktok-for-1-year-says-platform-promotes-violence-among-children-/7910029.html	2024-12-21T16:29:15-08:00	
Pope describes Israeli airstrikes of Gaza as 'cruelty'	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Saturday again condemned Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, a day after an Israeli government minister publicly denounced the pontiff for suggesting the global community should study whether the military offensive there constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. Francis opened his annual Christmas address to the Catholic cardinals who lead the Vatican's various departments with what appeared to be a reference to Israeli airstrikes on Friday that killed at least 25 Palestinians in Gaza. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' the pope said. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' The pope, as the leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but he has recently been more outspoken about Israel's military campaign against Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. In book excerpts published last month, the pontiff said some international experts said that 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.' Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. On Saturday, Francis also said that the Catholic bishop of Jerusalem, known as a patriarch, had tried to enter the Gaza Strip on Friday to visit Catholics there, but was denied entry. The patriarch's office told Reuters it was not able to comment on the pope's remarks about the patriarch being denied entry. The Israeli military said on Saturday the patriarch's entry had been approved, and he would enter Gaza on Sunday, barring any major security issues. Aid from the patriarch's office entered last week, the military said. Israel allows clerics to enter Gaza and 'works in cooperation with the Christian community to make it easier for the Christian population that remains in the Gaza Strip — including coordinating its removal from the Gaza Strip to a third country,' a statement from the military said. The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's retaliatory campaign, which it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, has killed more than 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins. Israel says that at least a third of the dead have been militants and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians, but that it is battling militants who it accuses of embedding among the population in dense urban areas. Hamas rejects this accusation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-describes-israeli-airstrikes-of-gaza-as-cruelty-/7909858.html	2024-12-21T15:50:48-08:00	
More than 20 civilians killed in central Mali village attacks	BAMAKO, MALI — Suspected Islamic militants killed more than 20 people in a string of attacks on villages in central Mali's insurgency-hit Mopti region on Friday, two local sources said. The unidentified assailants struck during the day and into the evening, ransacking and burning six villages in the Bandiagara area, the sources said on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity. One of the sources said the assailants had come in large numbers on motorcycles and attacked a village, where they killed everyone and destroyed everything. There was no immediate comment from the ruling military junta. The West African nation is battling armed groups with links to al-Qaida and Islamic State, which took root in its arid north following a Tuareg separatist rebellion in 2012. Militants have since spread to other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara, seizing territory, killing thousands of people, and uprooting millions in the process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-20-civilians-killed-in-central-mali-village-attacks/7909857.html	2024-12-21T15:26:51-08:00	
US military strikes Houthi targets in Yemen's capital	CAIRO — The U.S. military said it conducted precision airstrikes on Saturday against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. In a statement, the U.S. military's Central Command said the strikes aimed to 'disrupt and degrade Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden.' The U.S. military also said it struck multiple Houthi one-way drones and an anti-ship cruise missile over the Red Sea. Saturday's strike followed a similar attack last week by U.S. aircraft against a command-and-control facility operated by the Houthis, which control much of Yemen. On Thursday, Israel launched strikes against ports and energy infrastructure in Houthi-held parts of Yemen and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. The Iran-backed group in Yemen has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year to try to enforce a naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-s-capital-/7909854.html	2024-12-21T15:11:07-08:00	
Venezuela releases journalist detained during post-election protests	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Venezuelan authorities released a journalist accused of terrorism and arrested in the aftermath of President Nicolas Maduro's disputed July reelection, the country's press union announced Saturday. Ana Carolina Guaita, arrested on August 2, is a reporter for La Patilla, an outlet that is often critical of the government. 'Ana was imprisoned for more than four months' in La Guaira, a coastal city north of the capital, Caracas, the National Union of Press Workers said in a post on social media. 'She was accused of terrorism, incitement to hatred and obstruction of public roads,' the union said. Before her arrest, Guaita had covered the toppling of a statue of late president Hugo Chavez, whose legacy Maduro claims as Chavez's heir, during post-election protests. Demonstrations across the country erupted after Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the July 28 election, despite results published by the opposition appearing to show their candidate won by a landslide. The protests left 27 dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 under arrest. Only a handful of countries, including key Venezuela ally Russia, have recognized Maduro's reelection to a third six-year term. Guaita's release came hours after authorities announced the release of 200 detainees. According to the government's count, 733 people have been released, though the Foro Penal human rights group says the true number is lower.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-releases-journalist-detained-during-post-election-protests-/7909833.html	2024-12-21T14:03:18-08:00	
Airports reopen following Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Kazan	MOSCOW — The airport in the Russian city of Kazan reopened on Saturday after temporarily closing earlier in the day following a Ukrainian drone attack, Russia's aviation watchdog said. Russian state news agencies reported the drone attack on a residential complex and other areas in Kazan, some 800 kilometers east of Moscow. The Defense Ministry said the city had been attacked by three waves of drones between 7:40 a.m. and 9:20 a.m. (0440 and 0620 GMT). It said three drones were destroyed by air defense systems and three others by electronic warfare systems. There were no casualties reported, agencies said, citing local authorities. The mayor of Kazan said on Telegram that all planned mass events in the city would be canceled over the weekend and that authorities would offer temporary accommodation to evacuees. The Baza Telegram channel, which is close to Russia's security services, published unverified video footage showing an aerial object crashing into a high-rise building, producing a large fireball. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned the attack, saying Ukraine was 'taking out its impotent anger for real military defeats on the peaceful population of Russia.' Airports in Izhevsk, a smaller city northeast of Kazan, and Saratov, some 650 kilometers south of Kazan, had also temporarily halted flight arrivals and departures, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said via Telegram. Restrictions at the airports were later lifted, Rosaviatsia said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airports-reopen-following-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-russia-s-kazan/7909817.html	2024-12-21T13:35:47-08:00	
Senate review of Supreme Court ethics finds more luxury trips	WASHINGTON — A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct. Any movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows. The 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors. The court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices. 'The highest court in the land can't have the lowest ethical standards,' the committee chairman, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics. Republicans protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected. Attorney Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas who has been tapped for the incoming Trump administration, said the report was aimed at conservatives whose rulings Democrats disagreed with. 'This entire investigation was never about 'ethics' but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court,' Paoletta said in a statement posted on X. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thomas has said he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife, Ginni, took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since reported some earlier travel. Crow has maintained that he has never spoken with his friend about pending matters before the court. The report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he 'established the practice' of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said. The investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' according to the report. It also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules. Alito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito said the flags were raised by his wife. Thomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers or involving companies in which justices owned stock. Biden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kagan has publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky. Justice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge. The report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts' oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-review-of-supreme-court-ethics-finds-more-luxury-trips-/7909809.html	2024-12-21T13:01:50-08:00	
Children among at least 13 killed in stampedes at charity events in Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday. The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa's most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises around 4 a.m. local time, hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said. Some in the crowd had been waiting since the previous night. 'The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,' Loveth Inyang, a witness, said. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge. Crush starts before event begins Three people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. 'The event had not even started when the rush began,' police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. The church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, but the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy for the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. Disasters lead to change The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday when a local foundation organized a well-attended fair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under President Tinubu, who promised 'renewed hope' when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation, which is at a 28-year high, and the government's economic policies that have pushed the local currency to a record low against the dollar. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot to death and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/children-among-at-least-13-killed-in-stampedes-at-nigeria-christmas-charity-events-/7909801.html	2024-12-21T12:20:05-08:00

37 people die in crash between bus, truck in Brazil	SAO PAULO — A crash between a passenger bus and a truck early Saturday killed 37 people on a highway in Minas Gerais, a state in southeastern Brazil, officials said. The Minas Gerais fire department, which responded to the scene, said 13 others were taken to hospitals near the city of Teofilo Otoni. The bus had reportedly departed from Sao Paulo and was carrying 45 passengers. Authorities said Saturday afternoon that all victims had been removed from the site and an investigation would determine the cause of the accident. Witnesses told rescue teams that the bus blew a tire, causing the driver to lose control and collide with the truck. Others said that a granite block hit the bus, the fire department added. A car with three passengers also collided with the bus, but all three survived. Governor Romeu Zema wrote on social media platform X that he ordered 'full mobilization' of the Minas Gerais government to assist the victims. 'We are working to ensure that families of the victims are supported to face this tragedy in the most humane way possible, especially as it comes just before Christmas,' Zema said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-die-in-crash-between-bus-truck-in-brazil/7909774.html	2024-12-21T10:48:49-08:00

Lack of shelter, food increases Gazans’ misery as winter sets in	GENEVA — As temperatures drop and seasonal rains flood fragile settlements in the Gaza Strip this winter, aid agencies fear many Palestinians will die while others become critically ill and some permanently disabled. 'It is very cold. It has been raining overnight. … We are anticipating very heavy rain here today, and this is while 1.9 million people are displaced,' Louise Wateridge, senior emergency officer for UNRWA — the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees — told journalists in Geneva Friday from the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. Nuseirat, one of Gaza’s eight historical refugee camps established in 1948, came under Israeli fire last week, killing more than 30 Palestinians and injuring dozens of others. 'Palestinians do not have access to adequate shelter; 69% of buildings have been damaged or destroyed across the Gaza Strip,' Wateridge said. Although many people will lack shelter capable of protecting them from the winter cold and rain, she said, 'we have had to prioritize food over shelter entering the Gaza Strip.' Wateridge explained that essential relief supplies have been sitting in trucks 'outside the Gaza Strip waiting to enter for the past six months.' The UNRWA official also observed that the widespread damage and destruction of buildings throughout Gaza has left Palestinian families unprotected from Israel’s relentless airstrikes. 'We are hearing from doctors that children are getting injuries from shrapnel from strikes over a kilometer away from where the strikes hit, because there is nothing but tents and fabrics to protect them from any bombs and any bullets,' she said. Wateridge said that some of the most wrenching scenes she has witnessed 'are seeing toddlers in hospitals missing limbs after strikes … and seeing children searching through piles of trash for scraps of food or materials for shelter.' Rosalia Bollen, UNICEF’s communication specialist in Gaza, who has spent the past three months in the Palestinian enclave, warns that hunger, malnutrition and dire living conditions are putting the lives of children at risk. Speaking on a video link from Amman, Jordan, on Friday, Bollen said that more than 96% of women and children in Gaza cannot meet their basic nutritional needs. 'Most are surviving on rations of flour, pasta, lentils, can food at best … a diet that is slowly compromising their health,' she said, noting that healthier food is not available in Gaza because only 65 truckloads of aid daily were entering Gaza, compared with 500 trucks that entered daily before the war. 'Virtually all children under 2 in Gaza consume from two food groups at best. This is very, very dangerous because young children who grow rapidly need access to nutritious food … otherwise, they are at risk of wasting or stunting. 'The consequences of that are lifelong. Children do not recover from that later on,' she said, emphasizing the suffering is physical and psychological. 'Children are sick, tired and traumatized.' She said conditions for children are particularly bad in northern Gaza, which has been under 'a near total siege for 75 days now.' 'Gaza must be one of the most heartbreaking places for us humanitarians to work in, because every small effort we make to save a child’s life is undone by devastation,' she said. 'For over 14 months, children have been at the sharp edge of this nightmare, with more than 14,500 children reportedly killed and thousands more injured.' The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, UNICEF, UNRWA and other U.N. agencies carried out an assessment Thursday at four sites hosting some 1,600 families who had arrived from North Gaza since the Israeli siege began nearly 11 weeks ago. 'Families are packed into tents or damaged buildings with no electricity,' OCHA said. 'People sheltering at these sites lack the most basic items, including shoes, clothing, mattresses, blankets and kitchen supplies. They also reported a shortage of medicines, with diseases spreading rapidly due to the cold.' UNICEF’s Bollen noted that the onset of winter in Gaza has inflicted additional pain and suffering upon children badly in need of aid that could alleviate their misery. 'Children are cold. They are wet. They are barefoot. I see many children who still wear summer clothes, and with cooking gas gone, there also are lots of children I see scavenging through piles of garbage looking for plastic they can burn. Diseases are meanwhile ravaging their little bodies, while hospitals are destitute and constantly attacked,' she said. 'As many of us head into the celebrations of Christmas and New Year surrounded by so much, let us take a moment to think of these children who have so little and yet continue to lose more day by day. 'Every day without action steals another day from Gaza’s children. ... Gaza’s children cannot wait,' Bollen said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lack-of-shelter-food-increases-gazans-misery-as-winter-sets-in/7909663.html	2024-12-21T08:06:57-08:00	
France adds first nuclear reactor in 25 years to grid	PARIS — France connected the Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor to its grid on Saturday morning, state-run operator EDF said, in the first addition to the country's nuclear power network in 25 years. The reactor, which began operating in September ahead of the grid connection, is going online 12 years later than originally planned and at a cost of about $13 billion — four times the original budget. 'EDF teams have achieved the first connection of the Flamanville EPR to the national grid at 11:48 a.m. The reactor is now generating electricity,' EDF said in a statement. The Flamanville 3 European Pressurized Reactor is France's largest at 1.6 gigawatts and one of the world's biggest, along with China's 1.75 GW Taishan reactor, which is based on a similar design, and Finland's Olkiluoto. It is the first to be connected to the grid since COVAX 2 in 1999 but is being brought into service at a time of sluggish consumption, with France exporting a record amount of electricity this year. EDF is planning to build six new reactors to fulfill a 2022 pledge made by President Emmanuel Macron as part of the country's energy transition plans, although questions remain around the funding and timeline of the new projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-adds-first-nuclear-reactor-in-25-years-to-grid/7909633.html	2024-12-21T07:33:40-08:00	
Syria's new rulers name foreign minister in push for international relations	Syria's new rulers have appointed a foreign minister, the official Syrian news agency, or SANA, said on Saturday, as they seek to build international relations two weeks after Bashar al-Assad was ousted. The ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' No details were immediately available about Shibani. Syria's de facto ruler, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has actively engaged with foreign delegations since assuming power, including hosting the U.N.'s Syria envoy and senior U.S. diplomats. Sharaa has signaled a willingness to engage diplomatically with international envoys, saying his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development. He has said he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. The United States, other Western powers and many Syrians were glad to see rebel groups led by Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, topple Assad, but it is not clear whether the Islamist group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move toward democracy. HTS was part of al-Qaida until Sharaa broke ties with it in 2016. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family's decadeslong rule. Forces under the command of Sharaa — better known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani — installed a three-month caretaker government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria's northwestern province of Idlib. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al-Qaida in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. U.S. officials said Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-rulers-name-foreign-minister-in-push-for-international-relations/7909532.html	2024-12-21T04:56:27-08:00	
Pakistan dismisses US official's warning over missile program	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday dismissed as unfounded and 'devoid of rationality' assertions by a senior U.S. official that its missile program could eventually pose a threat to the United States. Earlier this week, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said Pakistan's development of long-range ballistic missiles made it an 'emerging threat.' Finer's comments, which came a day after Washington announced a new round of sanctions related to the ballistic missile program, underscored the deterioration in once-close ties between Washington and Islamabad since the 2021 U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Addressing Finer's remarks, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said the perception of an alleged threat was 'unfortunate.' 'These allegations are unfounded, devoid of rationality and sense of history,' the ministry said in a statement. The ministry said that its strategic capabilities were solely for defending its sovereignty and maintaining regional stability, and that they should not be perceived as a threat to any other country. It also highlighted Pakistan's long history of cooperation with the U.S., particularly in counterterrorism efforts, and reiterated its commitment to engaging constructively on all issues, including regional security and stability. Relations between the United States and Pakistan have seen significant ups and downs. The countries collaborated during the Cold War and in the fight against al-Qaida after 9/11. Ties have been strained, however, due to coups in the South Asian country by Pakistan's military, support for the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule in Afghanistan, and over the nuclear weapons program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-dismisses-us-official-s-warning-over-missile-program/7909526.html	2024-12-21T04:39:17-08:00	
Pakistan Taliban claim raid that killed 16 soldiers	ISLAMABAD — The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more. The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummeled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official told AFP on condition of anonymity. 'Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault,' he said. 'The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint.' A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometers from the Afghan border. Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged 'in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders.' The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device. Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident. Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan. Last year saw casualties hit a six-year high, with more than 1,500 civilians, security forces and militants killed, according to the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies. Saturday's attack was 'the most dangerous assault in this region this year' according to the first intelligence official. Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border. The Pakistani Taliban -- known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago. Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil. But a U.N. Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there -- and said 'the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group.' The report said the Afghan Taliban show 'ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training.' The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-taliban-claim-raid-that-killed-16-soldiers/7909469.html	2024-12-21T02:02:20-08:00	
Germans mourn attack on Christmas market with no answers about why	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY — Germans on Saturday mourned a violent attack and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor intentionally drove a black BMW into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers, killing at least two people, including a small child, and injuring at least 60 others. Authorities arrested a 50-year-old man at the site of the attack Friday evening and took him into custody for questioning. He has lived in Germany for nearly two decades, practicing medicine, officials said. Several German media outlets identified the man as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. There were still no answers Saturday as to what caused him to drive into a crowd in the eastern German city of Magdeburg. Describing himself as a former Muslim, he shared dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he said was the 'Islamism of Europe.' Some described him as an activist who helped Saudi women flee their homeland. He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Recently, he seemed focused on his theory that German authorities have been targeting Saudi asylum seekers. Prominent German terrorism expert Peter Neumann said he had yet to come across a suspect in an act of mass violence with that profile. 'After 25 years in this 'business' you think nothing could surprise you anymore. But a 50-year-old Saudi ex-Muslim who lives in East Germany, loves the AfD and wants to punish Germany for its tolerance towards Islamists — that really wasn't on my radar,' Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence at King's College London, wrote on X. The violence shocked Germany and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that's part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg's loss. Berlin, where a truck attack on a Christmas market in 2016 killed 12 people, kept its markets open but has increased its police presence at them. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser were due to travel to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening. 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives,' Scholz wrote on X. 'We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt's capital. Friday's attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect's arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers swarmed around the suspect and took him into custody. The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured. 'As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,' Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. 'Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.' Authorities identified the suspect as a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006 and who had been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers south of Magdeburg. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry condemned the attack on X but did not mention the suspect's connection to the kingdom. Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world. Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market's festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands. Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud 'you had to assume that something terrible had happened,' she said, calling it 'a dark day' for the city. The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country.

Pakistan military court jails 25 over 2023 attacks	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Twenty-five civilians were sentenced by a Pakistani military court to periods of two to 10 years of 'rigorous imprisonment' in connection with attacks on military facilities in 2023, the armed forces' media wing said on Saturday. The ruling underscores concerns among supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan that military courts are going to play a bigger role in cases involving the 72-year-old, who is facing multiple charges including allegedly inciting attacks against the armed forces. Thousands of Khan supporters stormed military installations and torched a general's house on May 9, 2023, to protest against the former premier's arrest by paramilitary soldiers. At least eight people were killed in the violence. The military's Inter-Services Public Relations office said the sentences handed down on Saturday were an 'important milestone in dispensation of justice to the nation.' 'It is also a stark reminder to all those who are exploited by the vested interests and fall prey to their political propaganda and intoxicating lies, to never take law in own hands,' it added in a statement. Others charged over the violence were being tried in antiterrorism courts, but justice would only be fully served 'once the mastermind and planners ... are punished as per the Constitution and laws of the land,' the military said. The ruling comes days after Khan was indicted by an antiterrorism court on charges of inciting attacks against the military. An army general who served under him as his spy chief, Faiz Hamid, is facing a military investigation on the same charges. Pakistan's Supreme Court last week allowed military courts to announce verdicts in concluded trials of nearly 85 supporters of Khan on charges of attacking army installations, however it made such verdicts conditional on the outcome of appeals against the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. The court last year provisionally allowed military courts to try civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7909459.html	2024-12-21T00:44:50-08:00	
Missile fired from Yemen hits Israel, wounding 16	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — A projectile fired from Yemen struck Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv early Saturday, wounding 16 people, the military and emergency service providers said, the second such attack within days. Israel's military said it had failed to intercept the projectile, which struck a district of Tel Aviv municipality, forcing many residents to leave their homes. Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it used a ballistic missile and was directed at 'a military target of the Israeli enemy.' The Iranian-backed Houthis have repeatedly launched missile attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians since the war in Gaza began more than a year ago, most of which have been intercepted. In return, Israel has struck multiple targets in Yemen, including ports and energy facilities in areas controlled by the Houthis. 'Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in central Israel, one projectile launched from Yemen was identified and unsuccessful interception attempts were made,' the Israeli military said on its Telegram channel. Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency medical service, said 16 people were lightly injured. 'I was at home and heard a loud explosion. I immediately went to the scene and saw significant blast damage to nearby buildings,' medic Yosef Kourdi was quoted as saying in a statement released by MDA. 'MDA teams provided medical care to 16 individuals who were mildly injured by glass shards from shattered windows in nearby buildings due to the impact of the strike,' the statement said. Ido Barnea, an IT manager whose apartment was damaged, told AFP a missile alert had sounded just before 4 a.m. 'Then there was a big ball of fire in the sky,' he said. 'I didn't even manage to get up and get dressed to go out.' 'Very lucky' An AFP photographer reported that many residents in the vicinity of the strike had to leave their homes, carrying only the essentials. AFP photographs showed debris from the bedroom of a house in the area hit by the projectile, as police swiftly cordoned off the neighborhood. Noa Mosseri, whose apartment was also damaged, told AFP she too heard the missile alert. 'We were very lucky because we didn't have time to get to a safe place. Within seconds there was a boom. We managed to get out and so we were not hurt,' she said. The Houthi rebels say they are acting in support of Palestinians and pledged in their statement on Saturday to continue operations 'until the aggression stops and the siege on the Gaza Strip is lifted.' The strike came just two days after the rebels fired a missile at Israel that damaged a school. Israel said that missile had been intercepted and the school was hit by its falling debris. Israel later struck several Houthi sites in Yemen, including in Sanaa -- the first such strike in the rebel-held capital. 'The Israeli enemy targeted ports in Hodeida and power stations in Sanaa, and the Israeli aggression resulted in the martyrdom of nine civilian martyrs,' rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a lengthy speech broadcast by the rebels' Al-Masira TV. Soon after retaliating for Thursday's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the rebels of severe repercussions. 'After Hamas, Hezbollah, and the [Bashar al-]Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis are almost the last remaining arm of Iran's axis of evil,' he said in a statement. 'The Houthis are learning and will learn the hard way, that those who strike Israel will pay a very heavy price for it.' On Dec. 9, a drone claimed by the Houthis exploded on the top floor of a residential building in the central Israel city of Yavne, causing no casualties. And in July, a Houthi drone attack in Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting retaliatory strikes on the port of Hodeidah. The Houthis have also regularly targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets by U.S. and sometimes British forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-fired-from-yemen-hits-israel-wounding-16/7909457.html	2024-12-21T00:33:09-08:00

VOA Kurdish: Torture and repression in Iraqi and Syrian prisons	Abu Ghraib, Saydnaya and other prisons in Iraq and Syria are symbols of the brutal regimes of the Baathist parties that ruled both countries. Under the dictatorial rule of the Tikrit family in Iraq and the Assad family in Syria, prisons became places of torture and extermination, where detainees were often subjected to horrific abuse regardless of their guilt. Former prisoners such as Aras Taleb Rashid, who was arrested for opposing Saddam Hussein, recall the similar methods of torture used in Iraqi and Syrian prisons.

Trump adds EU to list of trade partners he threatens with tariffs	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump on Friday added the 27 countries that make up the European Union to the list of trade partners he's threatening with tariffs — unless the group takes steps to import more U.S. goods. 'I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas,' Trump posted shortly after 1 a.m. on social media. 'Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!' In 2023, the United States' trade imbalance with the EU on goods was $209 billion, according to the Census Bureau. There were $576 billion in imports from Europe and $367 billion in exports from the United States. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions seeking greater clarity on the message, which for all its bluntness was unclear on next steps. When Trump threatened Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs in November, the leaders of both countries spoke with him to try to resolve any tensions. But the European Union lacks a single figure who can make the purchase commitments of natural gas and oil on behalf of its 27 member states that Trump is seeking. EU Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said in reaction to Trump's post that 'we are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector.' Gill noted that the EU is already 'committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply. We're not going to go into any details about what that might entail in the future, given that the new administration isn't even in place yet.' Scott Lincicome, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was difficult to parse what Trump was trying to say relative to European trade, given that natural gas exports to the continent are already up after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'What we really need to chalk all of this up to is Trump laying the groundwork for future negotiations,' Lincicome said. 'This is for better or worse a lot of what we're going to see for the next four years.' While there is a $209 billion trade imbalance, a more complicated relationship lies beneath those numbers. A company such as German automaker BMW can import parts needed to assemble vehicles at its factory in South Carolina, such that the trade totals also reflect the flow of goods within European companies that employ U.S. workers. More than half of the liquified natural gas imported by the EU and the United Kingdom in 2023 came from the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The volume of LNG going to the EU and UK has tripled since 2021. On Tuesday, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm issued a statement based on a new study saying that unfettered exports of LNG could increase prices domestically and increase carbon emissions. Trump ran for president on the idea that increased oil and natural gas production would reduce costs for U.S. voters who were left frustrated by a 2022 inflationary spike that still lingers. Trump's demands on Europe to buy more oil and natural gas were not especially new. He also made them during his initial term as president and in 2018 reached a deal with Jean-Claude Juncker, then-president of the European Commission, to sell more LNG to Europe. The problem with that agreement, as noted by the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, is that the U.S. 'cannot force companies to send products to a specific region or country' and the EU cannot force its members to buy American fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-adds-eu-to-list-of-trade-partners-he-threatens-with-tariffs-/7909390.html	2024-12-21T00:12:02-08:00	
Amid pope's big Holy Year, overtourism aggravates housing crisis	When Pope Francis left the Vatican earlier this month for his traditional Christmastime outing downtown, he acknowledged what many Romans have been complaining about for months: That his big plans for a Holy Year had turned their city into a giant construction pit, with traffic-clogging roadworks tearing up major thoroughfares, scaffolding covering prized monuments and short-term rentals gobbling up apartment blocks. Francis urged Romans to pray for their mayor — 'He has a lot to do' — but to nevertheless welcome the upcoming Jubilee as a time of spiritual repair and renewal. 'These worksites are fine, but beware: Don't forget the worksites of the soul!' Francis said. When he formally opens the Holy Year next week, Francis will launch a dizzying 12-month calendar of events that include special Jubilee Masses for the faithful from all walks of life: artists, adolescents, migrants, teachers and prisoners. And while the Jubilee's official start means the worst of the construction headache is ending, the arrival of a projected 32 million pilgrims in 2025 is set to only increase congestion in the Eternal City and intensify a housing crunch that has been driving residents away. Like many European art capitals, Rome has been suffering from overtourism as the Italian travel sector rebounds from COVID-19: Last year, a record high number of people visited Italy, 133.6 million, with foreign tourists pushing Italy over the EU average in growth of the travel sector, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported. Rome, with its innumerable artistic treasures, the Vatican and Italy's busiest airport, was the top city in terms of nights booked in registered lodging, ISTAT said. And yet for all its grande bellezze, Rome is hardly a modern European metropolis. It has notoriously inadequate public transportation and garbage collection. For the past two post-pandemic summers, taxis have been so hard to come by that the city of Rome authorized 1,000 new cab licenses for 2025. Rome's growing housing crisis — rents have risen about 10% this year — has gotten so bad that vigilantes have taken to going out at night with wire cutters to snip off the keyboxes on short-term apartment rentals that are blamed in part for driving up rents and driving out residents. 'The market is out of control and has definitely gotten worse with touristification, with the additional load of the Jubilee,' said Roberto Viviani, a university researcher whose landlord recently refused to renew his lease in favor of turning the apartment over to an agency to run as a holiday rental. 'The surprise was that he gave the Jubilee as the justification.' All of which has set the stage for a Jubilee opening Dec. 24 that is being received as something of a mixed bag. For the Vatican, the Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receiving indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins in the process. For the city of Rome, it's a chance to take advantage of some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in public funds to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of decay and neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards. But for Romans who have seen the short-term rental market take over neighborhoods like Pigneto, on the eastern flank of the capital, it's just another pressure point in a long-running battle to keep the flavor of their neighborhoods with affordable rents for ordinary Romans. 'The Jubilee has significantly worsened this phenomenon that we have seen, above all in the last months,' said Alberto Campailla, director of the association Nonna Roma, which has been slapping stickers 'Your BnB, our eviction' on Pigneto keyboxes to protest the growth of tourist rentals. Rome's relationship with Jubilees dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII inaugurated the first Holy Year in what historians say marked the definitive designation of Rome as the center of Christianity. Even then, the number of pilgrims was so significant that Dante referred to them in his Inferno. Massive public works projects have long accompanied Holy Years, including the creation of the Sistine Chapel (commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475) and the big Vatican garage (for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II). Some works have been controversial, such as the construction of Via della Concilliazione, the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square. An entire neighborhood was razed to make it for the 1950 Jubilee. The main public works project for the 2025 Jubilee is actually an extension of that boulevard: A pedestrian piazza along the Tiber linking Via della Conciliazione to the nearby Castel St. Angelo, with the major road that had separated them diverted to an underground tunnel. The project, at 79.5 million euros ($82.5 million) the most ambitious of the 2025 Jubilee works, ran into a predictable glitch over the summer when archaeological ruins were discovered during the dredging of the tunnel. The artifacts were transferred to the castle museum and the digging resumed, with the grand opening scheduled for Monday, the eve of the Jubilee's start. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has pointed to another feature of the 2025 projects that previous Jubilees have largely ignored, an emphasis on parks and 'green' initiatives, in keeping with Francis' focus on environmental sustainability. But Francis himself has acknowledged the paradox of the Jubilee on the lives of everyday Romans. He wrote to Rome-area priests and religious orders earlier this year to ask them to 'make a courageous gesture of love' by offering up any unused housing or apartments in their increasingly empty convents and monasteries to Romans threatened with eviction. 'I want all diocesan realities that own real estate to offer their contribution to stem the housing emergency with signs of charity and solidarity to generate hope in the thousands of people in the city of Rome who are in a condition of precarious housing,' Francis wrote. Gualtieri has gone farther, demanding alongside other mayors that the national government pass the necessary norms to let them regulate the proliferation of short-term rentals, which have been blamed for reducing the available long-term rental stock and driving up prices. 'This for us is an emergency because we need to prevent entire blocks of the center from emptying out and turning into B&Bs, because the presence of residents in the center is fundamental,' Gualtieri said. Just this week, Gualtieri joined nine other European mayors in urging the European Commission do more to address the overall urban housing crisis in many cities, where homelessness and rising rents are driving out students and workers and threatening the cities' abilities to attract and retain talent. But the Vatican's point-man for the Jubilee, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, defended the Holy Year as part of Rome's fabric and denied the influx of pilgrims was anything but a net gain for the city. 'As long as it has existed, Rome has always been called a 'common home,' a city that has always been open to everyone,' Fisichella said on the sidelines of a Jubilee promotional event. 'To think that Rome might reduce the presence of pilgrims or tourists would in my opinion inflict a wound that doesn't belong to it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-pope-s-big-holy-year-overtourism-aggravates-housing-crisis/7909382.html	2024-12-21T00:00:31-08:00	
Rising butter prices give European consumers and bakers a bad taste	PARIS — Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pains au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie. The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine. 'It's a distortion of what a croissant is,' Delmontel said. 'A croissant is made with butter.' One of life's little pleasures — butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its flavor — has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake. Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since. In Germany, a 250-gram block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality. The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world's largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw. European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can't hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as 'shrinkflation.' A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces. Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices. The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency. 'Every month butter gets more expensive,' Danuta Osinska, 77, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw. She and her husband love butter — on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior. 'There is no comparison,' Osinska said. 'Things are getting harder and harder.' The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. The party's presidential candidate is seeking to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp, for the inflation. Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk. Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises across Europe because of slim profit markets and hard work. She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia's war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link. Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said. An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said. The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to about $9 per kilo over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures. U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of about $10 per kilo in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November. Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation — or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less. Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe. Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said. 'Or else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,' Delmontel said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-butter-prices-give-european-consumers-and-bakers-a-bad-taste/7909369.html	2024-12-20T23:59:35-08:00	
Pennsylvania's Bethlehem, founded by Moravians on Christmas eve, keeps its traditions alive	BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA — On Christmas Eve in 1741, Moravian settlers named this Pennsylvania city after the biblical birthplace of Jesus. Nearly 300 years later, Moravians continue celebrating their Christmas season traditions in Bethlehem. They include the 'putz,' a Nativity scene that tells the story of Christ's birth with miniature wooden figurines, the making of thousands of beeswax candles by hand as a symbol of the light that Jesus brought to the world and a 'lovefeast,' a song service where worshippers share a simple meal of sweet buns and coffee in their pews. 'Like all Moravian traditions, the importance of it is that it brings people together,' said the Rev. Janel Rice, senior pastor of Central Moravian Church — Bethlehem's first congregation and the oldest Moravian church in North America. 'Building community, emphasizing that, over doctrine or dogma, is really the Moravian practice and tradition at our core,' she said. Moravians relate to the story of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Rice said, because their ancestors began as a refugee church fleeing religious persecution. The Nativity is also a poignant reminder today, when the number of people fleeing their homes because of war, violence and persecution continues to rise worldwide. 'It's so crucial because this story is not just Jesus's story of 2,000 years ago. It's today's story. And we need to make sure that we're living the word that we were told when it comes to these refugees,' said church member Sarah Wascura. 'That word is to give them refuge and to take care of them and to love them as ourselves.' A town founded on Christmas Eve The Moravian Church is one of the world's oldest Protestant denominations. Its name comes from the historical provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in what is now the Czech Republic. Their beliefs of practice over dogma began with a religious reformer, John Hus, who led a protest movement against some of the practices of Roman Catholic hierarchy. Hus believed congregants in his church should listen to Mass and read the Bible in their native Czech instead of Latin. He was accused of heresy and burned at the stake in 1415. His ideas were carried on by his supporters, who broke with Rome and founded the Moravian Church, or Unitas Fratrum (Unity of Brethren) in 1457 — decades before Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation. Moravians facing persecution eventually fled to Herrnhut, Germany, and established the original Renewed Moravian Church settlement, according to accounts of church history. Moravian missionaries later settled in Pennsylvania. On Christmas Eve in 1741, their leader, Count Nicolas Ludwig von Zinzendorf, who was visiting them, led them to a stable, where they sang the hymn Jesus Call Thou Me. Its lyrics say: 'Not Jerusalem — lowly Bethlehem 'twas that gave us Christ to save us.' Thus inspired, Zinzendorf named the settlement Bethlehem. Beloved tradition retells the story of the birth of Jesus Bethlehem's first settlers brought with them hand-carved figures to retell the story of Christ's birth. The tradition is known as the putz, from the German word 'putzen,' meaning to clean or decorate. 'It relates back to the creches of the Middle Ages,' Rice said. 'But it's not just a creche, which would be just the one Nativity scene.' Instead, it uses figures to tell different parts of the Gospel in miniature, including Mary's annunciation and the visit of the three wise men to the infant Jesus. In Victorian days, Rice said, Bethlehem's residents would 'go putzing' — visiting each other's homes between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day to look at Nativity scenes. In 1937, the local chamber of commerce launched a campaign promoting Bethlehem as 'Christmas City USA.' As part of that promotion, they took the tradition of the putz to the historic Hotel Bethlehem on Main Street. Thousands turned up. 'The story goes that the hotel got so crowded that they couldn't really accommodate the number of people that were coming to see it, and they asked Central Moravian Church to host it.' For every Christmas since then, the community putz has been put together by the church's congregants and displayed at the nearby Christian education building. 'It's more than Christmas for four weeks a year,' said Wascura, who went to the putz on her first date with Bob Wascura, her husband of 33 years. 'The nature of the faith heritage of the city is something that is never forgotten.' On a recent day, she led families visiting the community putz to their seats. After recounting a brief history of the Moravian Church and the Pennsylvania city, she drew a curtain to display the dozens of wooden figures — angels, shepherds, kings carrying gifts — in a tiny landscape decorated with pebbles, wood and moss. Children and parents listened to the recorded voice of Janel Rice, who narrated the biblical story about the other Bethlehem. 'We might wonder why setting up a putz and telling the story of Jesus' birth is so important to the Moravians, and now to the city of Bethlehem,' Rice says in the recording. 'One reason has to do with the naming of the city itself.' The church choir, after some singing, gave way to the powerful sound of the renowned Moravian Trombone Choir, known for playing its brassy tunes from the belfry of Central Moravian Church. When the lights turned on, children approached the stage to look up close at the figurines and point at surprises near the manger, including miniature zebras, lions and giraffes. 'We feel really lucky to live so close to Bethlehem with all of the history here and specifically the history pertaining to Christmas,' said visitor Kelly Ann Ryan. 'It's just something that we can't miss every holiday season as it rolls around.' She came to Bethlehem from a nearby town with her husband, Daniel, and their 5- and 8-year-old sons to see the community putz, in what she said has become a family tradition. 'Telling the Christmas story this way is a great way for kids to connect with it.' Lighting candles on Christmas Eve, joining Santa for a sleigh ride Christmas — from the Christian celebration to the secular commercial holiday — is omnipresent in Bethlehem. On a recent day, Santa Claus checked on a red sleigh (drawn by horses instead of reindeer) outside Central Moravian before he led families who hopped on for a tour of Bethlehem and its Moravian church settlements, which were recently designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Others strolled to nearby holiday-themed wooden huts or along Main Street with its stores decorated with Christmas globes and Moravian stars. Some stopped outside an Italian restaurant to greet Santa and Mrs. Claus, who welcomed diners and posed for photos. Across town, vendors sold ornaments at Christkindlmarkt, in the shadow of rusting blast furnaces of Bethlehem Steel illuminated in red and green. That company once supplied steel for construction of the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge and other landmarks. At Central Moravian, the choir sang hymns while sacristans handed out buns and mugs of coffee to families who enjoyed the sustenance in their pews at the 'lovefeast.' After Rice delivered a final blessing, Linda Thudium walked up the stairs and opened a large closet, where the congregation keeps thousands of handmade candles wrapped in red ribbons that they light during Christmas services. 'To me, this is Christmas — looking at these candles,' said Thudium. She recalled attending Christmas Eve services with lit candles since she was 5, a tradition she continued with her children and grandchildren. 'To me, this is just magical. I remember my parents doing this, my grandparents,' she said. 'It's just a wonderful warm feeling of being connected with this church.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pennsylvania-s-bethlehem-founded-by-moravians-on-christmas-eve-keeps-its-traditions-alive-/7908077.html	2024-12-20T23:58:53-08:00	
Younger Asian Americans navigate something new to their generation: Taking up space	NEW YORK — Client after client comes through the 12 Pell barbershop in Manhattan's Chinatown. They come for the cuts, and for the cool. On 12 Pell's lively social media accounts, the young, predominantly Asian American barbers don't hesitate to offer advice to teens and men of all ages and ethnicities with humor, quips, and confidence. Karho Leung, 34, a son of Chinatown and a 12 Pell co-founder, wanted to start a business that reflected him and his desire for 'building the world that I want to live in … not asking for permission.' About as American as it gets, right? The hunger to find your own way, make your voice heard? A look at social media and pop culture shows Leung and plenty of other Asian Americans of his and younger generations doing just that. But that American reality hasn't always belonged to everyone, including previous generations of Asian Americans. That American notion of having the freedom to stake out your own space? Sometimes, oftentimes, that has meant less space for others. Earlier generations of Asian Americans, some of whom have been here for well over a century and others whose roots trace to recent decades, have lived in Americas where their immigrant-origin communities were smaller and regarded as foreign, and where there was little mainstream familiarity with the countries they traced their ancestries to. And there was no Internet or social media culture that encouraged people to define their own lives. Instead, there were stereotypes that persist to this day — of otherness, of broken-English speaking and passiveness, at times sneaky or suspicious, or nerds and geeks. But even as those stereotypes still do harm, they don't have the same power in a time when many Americans eat from a global plate; where yoga studios and henna tattoos, temples and cultural festivals are everywhere, and the size, variety and geography of Asian American communities have increased dramatically in recent decades even as they remain a small part of the overall whole. Those stereotypes don't touch Leung the same way they impacted generations before him. 'It's funny because even though I watched this type of stereotype and portrayal happen growing up, it never really resonated or hit me that that was what I was up against,' he says. Jeff Yang, 56, a writer who has spent decades chronicling Asian American communities and culture, laughs when asked if the cultural space that Leung inhabits and makes his own sounds like the world of Yang's childhood. 'I grew up in a world where I felt like everything about me was projected on me by other people,' Yang says. 'The stories that were being told were all told by non-Asians about what I could do, who I could be, what I could look like.' It's not as if that world doesn't still exist. Simran Anand, 27, was still part of just one of three South Asian families in Reading, Pennsylvania, in the 2000s. She can relate, she says, to the sense earlier generations had of feeling culturally isolated in her day-to-day life when she stepped out of the family home. But she had something they lacked — large-scale South Asian communities in nearby places to visit and interact with. For her, it's both-and, not either-or, a sensibility she takes to her jewelry company, BySimran, which drew inspiration from South Asian designs but also adapted to fit her sensibilities as a young American woman. 'I am American, but I'm also South Asian,' she says. 'And I don't have to be one or the other.' Demetri Manabat, 23, agrees. Born and raised in Las Vegas to a Filipino father and Mexican mother, the spoken word artist says 'it sounds like a different world' to hear about his parents' experiences growing up. His parents didn't teach him or his brothers Tagalog, one of the languages of the Philippines, or Spanish because 'they grew up in a time where that was kind of frowned upon to be speaking a different language. And so they were under the assumption that that kind of perception would continue throughout my years, which it didn't,' Manabat says. Alex Paik remembers what it was like. The 43-year-old Korean American artist grew up in a predominantly white suburb outside of Philadelphia. 'When I was growing up, it was like I either was not Korean enough or too Korean,' he says. Today, he's intrigued watching his 11-year-old daughter. 'She loves to read, and there's so many stories now that are written by Asian American women that center Asian and Asian American girls as protagonists,' he says. 'I don't know how it would affect your sense of self, but it must affect it somehow, so I'm really curious to see how she grows up … It's just normal for her.' Factors that have made a difference in the lives of Asian Americans over time include the baseline demographic reality that there are more, and bigger, communities across the country largely due to the 1965 reform of immigration laws. Globalization has played a hand as well, introducing cultures to each other as the world has gotten smaller. And of course, the internet and technology. Paik thinks some of what he's seeing now is also the natural outpouring that comes from a connection to the country that looks different to those born here than it does for those who have immigrated here. 'When you start with the assumption that you belong in a space, I feel like that changes how you approach things,' he says. 'Whether or not that space actually wants you is kind of beside the point. There's an attitude you carry, like, yeah, of course this is my house, this is my country. I grew up here.' And 'I grew up here' — is the operative engine as new generations of Asian Americans rise and claim their own space — even if the assumptions they make about what's possible for them could be a bit unsettling for other generations. 'Previous generations, of course, they're going to have that kind of like 'what is going on' moment,' Manabat says. 'I do think that is the goal, to kind of have that moment of 'This is insane,' but it's everything that you kind of hoped would happen.' In short: building the world they want to live in. And not asking for permission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/younger-asian-americans-navigate-something-new-to-their-generation-taking-up-space-/7906680.html	2024-12-20T23:57:33-08:00	
Myanmar ethnic rebels say they’ve captured junta western command	BANGKOK — A Myanmar ethnic rebel group has captured a military regional command in Rakhine state, it said, in what would be a major blow to the junta. The Arakan Army had 'completely captured' the western regional command at Ann on Friday after weeks of fighting, the group said in a statement on its Telegram channel. Ann would be the second regional military command to fall to ethnic rebels in five months and a huge blow to the military. Myanmar's military has 14 regional commands across the country with many of them currently fighting established ethnic rebel groups or newer 'People's Defense Forces' that have sprung up to battle the military's 2021 coup. Fighting has rocked Rakhine state since the AA attacked security forces in November last year, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since the putsch. AA fighters have seized swathes of territory in the state that is home to China- and India-backed port projects and all but cut off state capital Sittwe. The AA posted photos of a man whom it said was the Ann deputy regional commander, in the custody of its fighters. AFP was unable to confirm that information and has contacted the AA's spokesperson for comment. AFP was unable to reach people on the ground around Ann where internet and phone services are patchy. In decades of on-off fighting since independence from Britain in 1948 the military had never lost a regional military command until last August, when the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army captured the northeastern command in Lashio in Shan state. Myanmar's borderlands are home to myriad ethnic armed groups who have battled the military since independence for autonomy and control of lucrative resources. Last month the U.N. warned Rakhine state was heading towards famine, as ongoing clashes squeeze commerce and agricultural production. 'Rakhine's economy has stopped functioning,' the report from the U.N. Development Program said, projecting 'famine conditions by mid-2025' if current levels of food insecurity were left unaddressed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-ethnic-rebels-say-they-ve-captured-junta-western-command-/7909438.html	2024-12-20T23:19:29-08:00	
Indonesians mark 2 decades since the tsunami that killed 230,000	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — Two decades after a catastrophic tsunami destroyed her village, Tria Asnani still cries when she recalls how she lost her mother while trying to escape the giant waves. Asnani, now a schoolteacher, was 17 at the time. Her father, who was a fisherman, never returned home from sea. She doesn't know how she survived. 'I cannot swim. I could only rely on dhikr (Islamic prayer).' On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. But Indonesia's Aceh province, located closest to the earthquake's epicenter and with 18 of 23 districts and cities located in the coastal line in the Northern side of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the disaster with more than half of the total death toll reported. The worst-hit areas were in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh, according to the Aceh Disaster Management Agency. Asnani's Lampuuk village lies in a fishermen's community in Aceh Besar, known for its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. However, on that day, it was among the hardest hit, with waves more than 30 meters high which changed the coastline in Aceh and led to land subsidence after the earthquake. Buildings by the coast were flattened to the ground except for Rahmatullah Mosque, 500 meters from the shore, and about a kilometer from Asnani's house. The photo of the place of worship, left pretty much unscathed, later became iconic. After the disastrous event, thousands, including Asnani, had to relocate to start afresh. She moved with her uncle to another region in Aceh to continue her studies. After she got married, she returned in 2007 to her parents' house which was rebuilt with assistance from the Turkish government and lived there for 10 years. Many international donors and organizations poured in money to help rebuild the affected areas that lost schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, made stronger than before the tsunami hit. Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh recorded more than 1,400 wrecked schools and about 150,000 students had their education process disrupted by the destructive waves in a report published in 2019. Three 'escape buildings' were also constructed in a relatively safer area to accommodate thousands of people if an earthquake and tsunami strike. Across the province, memories of the tsunami can be felt almost everywhere. The Aceh Tsunami Museum in Banda Aceh houses photos of the aftermath and vehicle debris, serving as a constant reminder of what was lost that day. Local authorities have also turned a former floating diesel-powered power plant barge that washed about 6 kilometers inland by the tsunami into another memorial place. Both places have become the most popular tourist destinations in the area. But development never stops and 20 years after the tsunami the Aceh coast is brimming with residential housing, cafes and restaurants, as well as tourism support facilities, while the hills in some areas from which people are currently being mined for sand and stone. Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, said that the government initially stipulated that there should be no activity up to 1 kilometer from the coast. Over time, many displaced fishermen returned to their original coastal homes, drawn by their livelihoods and ties to the sea, despite having received housing elsewhere. He also said the agency has 'provided the Acehnese people with information ' to deal with a potential tsunami. 'People already know what to do,' said Fazli, who, like other Indonesians, uses a single name. Siti Ikramatoun, a sociologist in Banda Aceh, said that despite years of recovery and rebuilding, the people of Aceh must stay vigilant. 'If people experienced (the tsunami), they may have an instinct to anticipate it. But those who do not have the experience, they won't get what to do,' Ikramatoun said. Various communities in Aceh commemorate the tsunami yearly along with the government and local authorities. In Banda Aceh, art communities in early December spread disaster awareness through theatrical or musical performances that can be easier for people to follow and target all groups, including those born after the tsunami. Muslina, 43, a civil servant, took her youngest son to the Aceh Tsunami Museum to watch one of the shows. She lost relatives and loved ones 20 years ago and she wants to make sure she always remembers them. 'Earlier my son asked me if there might be another tsunami when he grows up,' she said. 'I told him I do not know. Only God knows, but if there is a strong earthquake and the seawater recedes, we run, run, run to find higher ground.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesians-mark-2-decades-since-the-tsunami-that-killed-230-000/7909411.html	2024-12-20T20:51:59-08:00	
Thousands rally at US Embassy in Cuba against trade embargo	HAVANA — Thousands of Cubans joined a protest Friday in front of the U.S. Embassy in Havana that was led by President Miguel Diaz-Canel and ex-leader Raul Castro against Washington's long-standing trade blockade. 'We are marching now to tell the U.S. government to let the Cuban people live in peace. Down with interference!' Diaz-Canel told a crowd that had gathered a month before Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House. Communist Cuba is enduring a worsening economic crisis that the government blames on U.S. sanctions that have been in place since 1962 and were tightened during Trump's first term. 'If we didn't have the blockade, we would not be facing difficulty like this,' said 85-year-old retiree Faustino Miranda. The Caribbean nation faces a lack of food and medicine, frequent blackouts and a wave of emigration. Rogelio Savigne, 55, head of transport at a state-owned company, told AFP: 'We need them to open the doors for us to be able to trade with all countries.' Authorities said that 700,000 people marched in the capital on Friday. AFP was not able to independently verify that number. Former president Castro, 93, stood at the head of the march along with Diaz-Canel, who earlier Friday had blamed the U.S. embargo for making this year 'one of the most difficult' for Cuba. On Tuesday, the country's deputy foreign minister reiterated its willingness to enter into a dialogue with Trump, who will take office on Jan. 20. During his first term, Trump halted an easing of relations between Washington and Havana that began in 2014. He implemented 243 measures that reinforced the embargo, including the reincorporation of the island into the U.S. blacklist of 'countries that sponsor terrorism,' alongside Iran and North Korea. Current U.S. President Joe Biden has kept Cuba on that list but resumed discussions with Havana on counterterrorism and combating illegal migration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-at-us-embassy-in-cuba-against-trade-embargo/7909398.html	2024-12-20T19:46:32-08:00	
Ukraine strike kills 6 in Russia's Kursk region	Ukraine attacked a town in Russia's Kursk region Friday, killing six people, including a child, a senior local official said. Ten others were hospitalized in the town of Rylsk after the attack with U.S.-supplied HIMARS rockets, Kursk acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. The attack, Ukrainian officials said, followed an earlier Russian missile attack on Kyiv. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said an early Friday morning Russian ballistic missile attack on the capital killed at least one person, wounded 13 and damaged six foreign embassies and a university in the city's center. On its Telegram social media account, Ukraine's air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city, but falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. City officials reported damage to multiple residential buildings, medical facilities and schools. Air force officials urged citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats because they provide very little time to find shelter. At a briefing in Kyiv on Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhyi said the missile attack did significant damage to a building that houses the embassies of Albania, Argentina, the Palestinians, North Macedonia, Portugal and Montenegro. He shared pictures of the damage to the buildings. No injuries were reported in those attacks. The Kyiv National Linguistics University said on its Instagram account that its building also had been hit, and it shared a picture of an area near an entrance where two large windows had been blown out. Russia has said it launched the attack in retaliation for Kyiv's firing U.S.-made weapons into Russia. Russia's attacks on Kyiv came one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin's year-end press conference. Putin has been talking about negotiations to end the war 'for quite some time, but the bombing has continued,' said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. President-elect Donald Trump has talked about the possibility of talks with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to end the war. He has said he could broker a deal to end the war in 24 hours. Kupchan said Trump is 'naive' to think he could get the two countries to come to an agreement so swiftly. Trump 'cannot afford a deal that effectively subjugates Ukraine and leaves it a ward of Russia,' Kupchan said. Ukraine must be defensible, he said, and 'not left in a geopolitical limbo that invites Russia to simply pick up the war where it left off six months from now ... or a year later.' Meanwhile, Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister and minister of justice, reported Friday that Russia had launched a cyberattack on state registers, resulting in a shutdown. Stefanishyna made the initial report from her Facebook page, where she said it was clear the attack was orchestrated by Russia to 'sow panic among citizens of Ukraine and abroad.' She held a briefing later Friday in Kyiv along with Ukraine's acting head of the Cybersecurity Department of the security service, Volodymyr Karastelov. She told reporters that while it appeared no data were lost or stolen, the ministry suspended the activities of all state registers to avoid further deployment of threats. The affected registries include civil acts such as marriages, wills, births and car registrations, and Stefanishyna said they were working to restore them. The Cybersecurity Department said its main line of investigation was that a hacker group affiliated with Russian military intelligence was behind the attack. Russia has yet to comment on the attack. VOA's Kim Lewis contributed to this report. Some information came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-strike-kills-6-in-russia-s-kursk-region/7909381.html	2024-12-20T18:50:53-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau reshuffles Cabinet as resignation calls mount	Toronto, ontario — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's chances of staying in power have become more tenuous since the opposition party that backed his government for years announced it would vote no confidence in the government when Parliament resumed. An embattled Trudeau reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday, but whether he will step aside in the coming days or weeks remained an open question. Trudeau did not address his future or take questions after he left the meeting with his new Cabinet. But he said his government was preparing for Donald Trump and his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products. 'In exactly one month the new president will be inaugurated, and we are preparing Canada to face that,' Trudeau said in his first remarks to reporters since his finance minister quit. But Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can’t recover from. 'The prime minister has simply asked for some time to reflect on his own future,' said David McGuinty, the new public safety minister. Rachel Bendayan, the official languages minister, said Trudeau 'told us he had a difficult choice to make.' The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Trudeau the governor of the 51st state and has threatened to impose sweeping tariffs if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs into the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened. 'We have in the next 60 days an existential threat for the Canadian economy, for people that could lose their jobs. The unemployment rate could double. We need to focus on that,' said Marc Miller, the immigration minister and a close friend of Trudeau's. 'I think he’s the best to lead us in a very difficult situation. We can’t be in a position where the government has no ability to fight back.' Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, but the leftist New Democratic Party said Friday that it would trigger a vote of no confidence in Trudeau after lawmakers reconvene on January 27. Because Trudeau’s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on Trudeau to resign — and he made clear Friday the NDP would vote to bring down the government. The Liberals could delay Parliament’s return. Trudeau could decide not to run in next year’s election and allow for a party leadership race. Liberal Rob Oliphant became the latest lawmaker to call for the prime minister to step aside, saying there should be a 'robust, open leadership contest.' Trudeau, who has led the country for nearly a decade, has become widely unpopular in recent years over a range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation. There is no mechanism for Trudeau’s party to force him out in the short term. He could say he will step aside when a new party leader is chosen, or his Liberal Party could be forced from power by a no-confidence vote in Parliament that would trigger an election, which would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said Canada needs an immediate election and requires a prime minister who can face Trump from a position of strength.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-reshuffles-cabinet-as-resignation-calls-mount/7909386.html	2024-12-20T18:43:36-08:00	
Foreign worker visa program faces uncertainty under second Trump term	WASHINGTON — Foreign workers seeking U.S. jobs enjoyed near-guaranteed visa success in fiscal year 2024, with immigration authorities approving more than 97% of H1-B visa applications, as reported by the National Foundation for American Policy. The was the second-highest approval rate in more than a decade. But the exceptionally high success rate could soon end if President-elect Donald Trump's team revives his first administration's restrictive immigration policies, according to immigration lawyers. That in turn could significantly affect U.S. businesses and other institutions that rely on highly skilled foreign workers, especially those from India, they warn. 'I think it's going to get harder, and it's going to be more complicated to approve things,' said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and a former lawyer for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Companies exploit program, say critics Created in 1990, the H-1B program lets U.S. employers hire foreign talent in specialized fields such as technology, engineering and health care, with 85,000 visas issued by lottery. Indian workers received more than 70% of the slots in recent years, followed by Chinese nationals. The program has long been the subject of controversy. Proponents point to its role allowing the U.S. to attract top foreign talent and fill critical jobs. A 2016 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that nearly one-quarter of America's billion-dollar startups had a founder who first came to the U.S. as an international student. But critics view the program as a weapon against American workers. Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) pointed to Disney's controversial move a decade ago to lay off hundreds of U.S. staff members, forcing them to train foreign replacements as a condition of their severance. Though Disney denied any wrongdoing and beat subsequent lawsuits, the case became a rallying cry among anti-immigrant groups. FAIR says U.S. companies exploit the system to hire cheaper foreign labor, driving down U.S. wages. 'There are plenty of tech workers available here in the United States, and that should be the first resort for these companies to go out there and hire people who are American citizens,' Mehlman, FAIR's media director, said in an interview with VOA. Mehlman said the program has strayed from its roots as a temporary foreign worker program, with foreign nationals using it as a backdoor to American citizenship. 'This should be a program that says you're going to come here for a specified amount of time, the duration of your visa, and then you're going to return home,' Mehlman said. The criticism is shared by many congressional Republicans as well as Trump, who in 2016 campaigned to end what he called 'a cheap labor program.' That did not happen, but the first Trump administration moved swiftly against the program after Trump issued his Buy American, Hire American executive order within months of taking office. Immigration officials followed up with stricter degree and wage requirements for foreign workers. Most of those rules were eventually blocked by courts. But immigration officers found other ways to squeeze the program. They approved some visa requests for one year instead of three, rejected automatic extensions and ramped up worksite inspections. Visa applicants were hit with mounting demands for evidence to process their petitions, according to immigration lawyers. The crackdown hit hard. New visa denials soared to 24% in 2018 and dropped to 21% in 2019 before easing to 13% in 2020. That marked a sharp departure from the Obama era, when fewer than 1 in 10 petitions were denied. 'What we did see that kind of worked effectively under the Trump administration was a gutting of the system,' said Dalal-Dheini, who worked as a special counsel at the USCIS during the first Trump administration. Trump's plan for visas uncertain While changing rules and regulations are cumbersome and time-consuming, immigration lawyers warn about a likely return to the tactics the first Trump administration used to limit the number of visas issued to foreign workers. Kathleen Campbell Walker, head of immigration practice at the Dickinson Wright law firm, said she is particularly concerned that increased scrutiny by federal anti-fraud agents could slow things down and potentially create 'more difficulty in getting your H-1B visa status approved.' 'That worries me,' Walker, a former national president of AILA, said in an interview with VOA. The incoming administration's plans for the visa program remain uncertain. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a VOA request for comment, but a campaign spokesperson said in a statement to The Washington Post earlier this year that Trump 'will restore all of his prior [immigration] policies' immediately upon returning to the White House. While Trump's new administration is expected to focus on cracking down on undocumented immigrants, immigration lawyers say the new administration could target legal as well as illegal immigration, pointing to the appointment of immigration hardliners such as Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming White House deputy chief of staff. Yet signals are mixed. Trump has floated the idea of giving green cards to foreign graduates of American colleges and universities. And key Trump ally Elon Musk is a staunch supporter of the H-1B program, with Tesla hiring 742 new foreign workers in fiscal year 2024, ranking 16th among U.S. companies with the most H-1B visa approvals. While it's unclear what influence, if any, Musk will have on Trump's immigration policies, Walker said she's 'hoping he may be in there to try to help tweak things that are from a positive perspective for the H-1B category.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-worker-visa-program-faces-uncertainty-under-second-trump-term/7909372.html	2024-12-20T18:21:42-08:00

Senate approves 235th judge of Biden's term, beating Trump's tally	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden secured the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency Friday, an accomplishment that exceeds his predecessor's total by one after Democrats put extra emphasis on the federal courts following Donald Trump's far-reaching first term, when he filled three seats on the Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, teed up votes on two California district judges, and they were likely to be the last judicial confirmations this year before Congress adjourns and makes way for a new, Republican-led Senate. The confirmation of Serena Raquel Murillo to be a district judge for the Central District of California broke Trump's mark. Come next year, Republicans will look to boost Trump's already considerable influence on the makeup of the federal judiciary in his second term. Biden and Senate Democrats placed particular focus on adding women, minorities and public defenders to the judicial ranks. About two-thirds of Biden's appointees are women and a solid majority of appointees are people of color. The most notable appointee was Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African American woman to serve on the nation's highest court. 'Prior to our effort, the number of women on the federal bench was really diminished. It was overwhelmingly white males,' said Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'We consciously moved forward to bring more women to the bench, and believe me, we had a great talent pool to work with. So I think it'll enhance the image of the court and its work product to bring these new judges on.' Biden also placed an emphasis on bringing more civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor rights lawyers to expand the professional backgrounds of the federal judiciary. More than 45 appointees are public defenders, and more than two dozen served as civil rights lawyers. While Biden did get more district judges confirmed than Trump, he had fewer higher-tier circuit court appointments than Trump — 45 compared with 54 for Trump. And he got one Supreme Court appointment compared with three for Trump. Republicans, much to Democrats' frustration, filled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the court the week before the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg had died in September. Democrats also faced the challenge of confirming nominees during two years of a 50-50 Senate. Rarely a week went by in the current Congress when Schumer did not tee up votes on judicial confirmations as liberal groups urged Democrats to show the same kind of urgency on judges that Republicans exhibited under Trump. Some Senate Republicans were harshly critical of Biden's choices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said talk of diversity did not extend to the views of the nominees. 'One of the consequences of the age of Trump is that it drove Democrats insane, and it drove them to the extreme left, so they put people on the bench who were selected because they were extreme partisans,' Cruz said. Liberal-leaning advocacy groups said they are delighted with the number of judges Democrats secured, but even more so with the quality of the nominees. They said diversity in personal and professional backgrounds improves judicial decision-making, helps build public trust and inspires people from all walks of life to pursue legal careers. 'For our federal judiciary to actually deliver equal justice for all, it really has to be for all, and that is one reason why we certainly applaud this administration for prioritizing both professional but also demographic diversity,' said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Democrats showed newfound resolve on judicial confirmations. 'They learned a lesson from the first Trump administration,' Grassley said. 'Paying attention to the number of judges you get and the type of judges you put on the court is worth it.' Part of the urgency from Democrats came as they watched the nation's highest court overturn abortion protections, eliminate affirmative action in higher education and weaken the federal government's ability to protect the environment, public health and workplace safety through regulations. The cases showed that the balance of power in Washington extends to the judicial branch. Trump will inherit nearly three dozen judicial vacancies, but that number is expected to rise because of Republican-appointed judges who held off on retirement in hopes that a Republican would return to office and pick their replacements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-approves-235th-judge-of-biden-s-term-beating-trump-s-tally-/7909364.html	2024-12-20T17:24:59-08:00	
El Salvador violated woman's rights in high-risk pregnancy case, court rules	SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA / SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR — El Salvador violated a woman's rights after denying her an abortion in 2013 despite doctors' calls to terminate her high-risk pregnancy, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) said Friday. The case of the woman, a domestic worker known as Beatriz, became a symbol of El Salvador's blanket ban on abortion, which punishes with prison time those who undergo the procedure, perform it or assist with it. The court's decision found the Salvadoran state 'internationally responsible for failing to fulfill its duty of due diligence in ensuring the rights to access effective judicial remedies, personal integrity, health and privacy' for Beatriz. Doctors diagnosed Beatriz, then 22 and suffering from lupus and other ailments, with her second high-risk pregnancy in February 2013 and said the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. They recommended an abortion but would not perform the procedure given El Salvador's severe prohibition. Beatriz appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected her request. In June 2013, she underwent a cesarean section, and her daughter died hours later. Beatriz died in 2017 from complications due to a motorcycle accident that occurred en route to a medical appointment. The IACHR said there was not a proven causal link between Beatriz's death in 2017 and the medical care during her second pregnancy in 2013, so it did not rule on state responsibility for her death. In its ruling, the IACHR ordered El Salvador to implement measures such as creating guidelines and protocols for medical and judicial personnel to ensure legal clarity and proper care in similar cases. 'The lack of legal certainty regarding the handling of Beatriz's case led to the bureaucratization and judicialization of the necessary medical care, resulting in multiple consequences,' the IACHR's statement said. The El Salvador president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At a press conference on Friday, Beatriz's mother, known publicly only as Delmy, celebrated the ruling alongside Beatriz's brother and women's rights activists. 'I know it has not been easy, but the state has the duty and the right to respond to the measures that the court has imposed, and for me, it is a great triumph,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-violated-woman-s-rights-in-high-risk-pregnancy-case-court-rules/7909351.html	2024-12-20T17:07:45-08:00

Lithuania faces tough balancing act over ties with China	taipei, taiwan — The pledge by Lithuania’s new government to reset diplomatic relations with China after Beijing downgraded bilateral ties with the country in 2021 is facing challenges even before it has begun. Analysts say Lithuania’s recent decision to expel three of China’s diplomats and the damage done to two data cables in the Baltic Sea – as well as questions about the role a Chinese cargo ship may have played – are complicating that effort. China downgraded ties with Lithuania after the previous government agreed to open a representative office for Taiwan in the capital, Vilnius, in 2021 that used the English word 'Taiwanese' in its name. Beijing bristles at any moves that give democratically governed Taiwan added international recognition. Most of Taiwan’s overseas representative offices have Taipei in their name. Balancing act Tomas Janeliunas, an international relations professor at Vilnius University, says Lithuania’s new government will have to play a balancing act when it comes to relations with China because each change in the geopolitical landscape can have an impact. 'When a new tension point breaks out, Lithuania will have no choice but to skip this balancing policy and return to the more aggressive diplomacy toward China,' he told VOA in a phone interview this week. Following its parliamentary elections in October, Lithuania’s new prime minister, Gintautas Paluckas, vowed to restore full diplomatic relations with China without 'humiliating' Lithuania and 'falling to our knees and begging for anything.' In an interview with the Baltic News Service on Nov. 1, Paluckas said that it is certainly an aspiration to have normal relations with China. Relations with China 'will not be very rosy,' with the two sides arguing about economic and protectionist measures, but the European Union 'is trying to maintain diplomatic relations,' he said. 'We are a sovereign country, we have no dependency on China, and nobody is trying to create one, but diplomatic relations are valuable. And one truly needs to have them,' he said. Zhao Junjie, a senior research fellow at the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times that Paluckas’ comments show the new Lithuania government is 'turning to more rational, pragmatic and sustainable ways' to handle relations with China. New government’s differing views Despite the new prime minister’s stated intention to resume diplomatic exchanges with Beijing, there are also differing views on how Lithuania should handle relations with China within the new government. The Lithuanian government’s latest four-year plan, which the country's Parliament approved Dec. 12, calls China 'a growing challenge' to the Baltic state’s foreign and security policies. The plan also pledges to develop economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, which China views as an inseparable part of its territory. In an interview with Baltic News Service on Dec. 3, Lithuania’s new foreign minister, Kestutis Budrys, said China bears the responsibility of initiating steps to restore diplomatic relations with Lithuania. 'It was not Lithuania that decided to downgrade the level of diplomatic representation and initiated the change of its form altogether,' Budrys said, adding that all sides across Lithuania’s political spectrum support the restoration of diplomatic ties with China if the Baltic state’s national security is ensured. Meanwhile, Lithuania’s minister of economy and innovation, Lukas Savickas, said in an interview on December 12 that the previous government’s position on China had been 'out of line' and that Lithuanian businesses have interests in the Chinese market. Experts say since the new government has explicitly presented China as a foreign policy and security challenge to Lithuania, Vilnius is unlikely to fundamentally change its policies toward China. While 'the previous government, which pursued the so-called values-based foreign policy, only vaguely mentioned China in its program, the new [government’s] program sets the boundaries in this regard much clearer,' said Raigirdas Boruta, an associate expert at Vilnius University’s Eastern Europe Studies Center. Since the new government has pledged to keep developing economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, Boruta told VOA that Lithuania is unlikely to make fundamental changes to its relationship with China under the center-left-led administration. Aggressive actor Other recent events have also added new sources of tension to the bilateral relationship. In late November, a Chinese bulk carrier carrying Russian fertilizers, Yi Peng 3, was suspected of severing two data cables in the Baltic Sea, prompting investigators from several European countries, including Sweden, Lithuania and Finland, to surround the ship and seek to conduct a thorough investigation. Additionally, Lithuania announced the expulsion of three Chinese diplomats after declaring them 'personae non gratae' on November 29. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry said the Chinese diplomats violated the Vienna Convention and Lithuanian legislation but did not provide further details about the expulsion. Beijing condemned Lithuania’s expulsion of the Chinese diplomats, describing the move as 'provocative.' 'China reserves the right to take countermeasures against Lithuania,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement released on December 2. Janeliunas said these events have hardened the Lithuanian public’s impression of China as an aggressive actor in the Baltic region, making it difficult for the new government to reduce tension between the two countries. If the government 'talks about softening Lithuania’s attitude toward China, it could trigger some harsh reactions from society or some media outlets, as they question why the ruling Social Democrats are considering such a move,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-faces-tough-balancing-act-over-ties-with-china/7909134.html	2024-12-20T16:10:06-08:00	
Stopgap bill passes House to fund federal government	WASHINGTON — After two failed attempts to pass a bill to fund the U.S. government, the U.S. House passed a stopgap bill to fund the federal government through March. The vote was 366 to 34, with one member voting present. All of the 34 votes against the bill were cast by Republicans. House Republicans reached an agreement among themselves on a new proposal earlier Friday. After a lengthy meeting with Republican lawmakers, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had agreed on a new proposal to fund the government. 'There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward,' Johnson told reporters. 'But I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown.' The last-ditch effort to avoid a government shutdown comes after Republicans in Congress failed on Thursday to pass a spending bill that was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. That bill would have raised the debt ceiling, which Trump had demanded at the last minute. Dozens of Republicans voted against Thursday’s bill, and only two Democrats supported it. Both chambers of Congress – the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate – must approve the measure in order to pass the bill and avoid a shutdown. President Joe Biden said Friday that he supports the bill and would sign it. The new plan is the same bill as the one that failed on Thursday, except without the debt ceiling suspension, according to media reports. That means it will include a clean short-term extension of government funding, billions of dollars in disaster relief and billions more in aid to farmers. Problems began for Johnson this week when he abandoned a bipartisan funding deal he had reached with Democrats after Trump and billionaire Elon Musk lambasted the plan. Without a funding extension, government funding technically runs out at midnight Friday night. But most of the impact of the shutdown wouldn’t begin to take effect until Monday. The White House on Friday echoed calls from Democratic lawmakers in urging Republicans to avoid a government shutdown. In the event of a shutdown, many government workers will be furloughed, but those who provide essential services will continue to report to their jobs. But none of those federal workers would be paid until Congress passes a new spending bill. Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement are among those who would continue to work but would not be paid until Congress approved a new spending plan. The threat of a shutdown comes right before Christmas. While about 59,000 of the Transportation Security Administration’s 62,000 workers are deemed essential and would continue to work without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said a shutdown would likely still cause delays at airports. The longest U.S. government shutdown in history lasted 34 days from December 2018 until January 2019, when then-President Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill that did not include several billion dollars for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The ploy hurt his approval ratings. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stopgap-bill-passes-house-to-fund-federal-government-/7909305.html	2024-12-20T16:02:31-08:00	
US charges Russian Israeli dual national tied to Lockbit ransomware group	washington — The United States has charged a Russian Israeli dual citizen over alleged involvement with the Lockbit ransomware group, the Justice Department said Friday. Rostislav Panev, 51, was arrested in Israel in August and is awaiting extradition to the United States, the department said. Panev was a developer at Lockbit from its inception in 2019 until at least February 2024, during which time the group grew into 'what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world,' the department said. 'The Justice Department's work going after the world's most dangerous ransomware schemes includes not only dismantling networks but also finding and bringing to justice the individuals responsible for building and running them,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Lockbit and its malware were linked to attacks on more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, according to the department, including small businesses and large multinationals, hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, government and law enforcement agencies. Lockbit was discovered in 2020 when its eponymous malicious software was found on Russian-language cybercrime forums. It operated a ransomware-as-a-service operation, in which a core group of developers and administrators worked with affiliates who carried out attacks. Extortion proceeds were split among the parties involved. Lockbit and its affiliates extorted at least $500 million in payments from victims, according to the Justice Department, as well as causing significant costs from lost revenue and incident response and recovery. The arrest followed two guilty pleas in July from a pair of Russian members of the Lockbit gang — Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev — and the seizure in February of numerous Lockbit websites by Britain's National Crime Agency, the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. Lockbit reappeared online not long after the seizure, defiantly saying: 'I cannot be stopped.' But law enforcement officials and experts say the bust helped damage the gang's standing in the cybercriminal underworld. Government actions 'have proven incredibly effective at dismantling and discrediting' Lockbit as a brand and bringing the group's volume of attacks down precipitously, said Jeremy Kennelly, a cybersecurity analyst with Google owner Alphabet. Affiliates and others working with the group may have shifted to collaborating with other gangs, Kennelly said, but the crackdown has been 'critical to ensuring that ransomware and extortion are seen as crimes for which there are consequences.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-russian-israeli-dual-national-tied-to-lockbit-ransomware-group/7909115.html	2024-12-20T15:39:13-08:00	
Young Rohingya hope for peace in Myanmar, even as challenges persist	washington — In Myanmar's conflict-stricken northern Rakhine State, the country’s Rohingya community is facing yet another harrowing chapter. Targeted by a military junta accused of genocide, they are now enduring the forced recruitment of their young men to fight against the Arakan Army, a large ethnic armed group that has been fighting the Myanmar government for control of the region since long before the current crisis. The forced recruitment pits the Rohingya against their ethnic Rakhine neighbors, leading to further tension between the two groups. The Arakan Army declared last week that it had 'fully captured Maungdaw Township,' a region primarily inhabited by Rohingya people on Myanmar's western border with Bangladesh. In its statement, the ethnic armed group noted that it is 'pursuing members of the military junta and their allied Islamist extremist armed forces, who fled the camp without surrendering,' presumably referring to Rohingya soldiers forced to join the fight against the insurgency. According to a September report from Human Rights Watch, the Myanmar military has abducted and forcibly recruited more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslim men and boys from across Rakhine State since February 2024. Amid this escalating crisis, Zar Ni Soe, a prominent young Rohingya human rights activist, has traveled to Washington to meet with members of the U.S. government, including State Department and congressional representatives. During his trip, he spoke to VOA about his experiences and unwavering hope for peace amid the conflict. 'The Rohingya are under siege,' he said in an interview in a VOA studio. 'We are not allowed to move freely. The junta visits the IDP [internally displaced persons] camps once a month, not to provide aid but to intimidate civilians. Our lives are constantly overshadowed by fear.' The military’s use of conscription laws to arm the Rohingya against the Arakan Army has exacerbated an already dire situation. 'Young Rohingya are being forcibly recruited,' Zar Ni Soe said. 'The military threatens our people, giving them no right to refuse. This systematic oppression leaves us feeling hopeless and deeply anguished.' Myanmar’s junta has consistently denied accusations of forced conscription, framing its recruitment efforts as voluntary and aimed at maintaining national security. Rebel groups such as the Arakan Army also have been accused of using forced recruits. The Arakan Army denies that it does. Zar Ni Soe believes the root of the problem lies with Myanmar’s military dictatorship. 'The solution begins with ending the junta’s rule,' he asserted. 'As long as the military holds power, they will continue to exploit and oppress ethnic groups like the Rohingya.' ICC arrest warrant The young Rohingya activist expressed optimism about the International Criminal Court's move to seek an arrest warrant against Myanmar's military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Myanmar’s military rulers have rejected the arrest warrant, noting that the country is not a member of the ICC and calling the move interference in the country’s sovereignty. Zar Ni Soe has a different view. 'We, the Rohingya community, welcome this,' he said. 'This is a victory not only for us but for all of Myanmar, where the dictatorship continues to commit widespread human rights violations.' Since 2017, the United Nations has documented widespread abuses against the ethnic Rohingya under the pretext of 'territorial cleansing.' The International Court of Justice began addressing these alleged crimes in 2019 when Gambia filed a genocide case against Myanmar. 'The Rohingya’s plight gained global attention in 2017, and now the ICC’s action brings it to the forefront of international justice,' he said. While Myanmar is not an ICC member, Bangladesh is, allowing the ICC to investigate crimes partly committed on Bangladeshi soil. In October, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan requested the arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing on charges of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Arakan Army Established in 2009 by Rakhine youth leaders, the Arakan Army represents the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group and seeks autonomy in Rakhine State, aiming to 'restore the sovereignty of the Arakan people.' As part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance – alongside the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta’Ang National Liberation Army – the AA has grown into a formidable force with an estimated 45,000 troops. In October 2023, the AA achieved significant gains against the military junta during the '1027' operation. This included the capture of the large military compound BGP5, built on the site of Myo Thu Gyi, a Rohingya village destroyed in 2017. The victory gave the AA control over the entire border between Rakhine State and Bangladesh for the first time since the 2021 coup. Junta attacks on AA positions have led to civilian casualties, particularly in Rohingya villages, further escalating violence. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has condemned abuses by both the military and the AA, citing forced recruitment, extrajudicial killings and indiscriminate attacks that violate international law. Over four months, AA offensives displaced tens of thousands, including many Rohingya. On August 5, dozens of Rohingya were killed near the Naf River, underscoring their plight as they remain trapped between escalating violence and closed borders, with no safe refuge. Safe zone advocacy Zar Ni Soe recently met with State Department officials and congressional representatives to highlight urgent Rohingya issues. 'First, we called for immediate sanctions on the military council to stop airstrikes against the Rohingya and other ethnic groups,' he told VOA. 'Second, we proposed a humanitarian corridor along the Rakhine-Bangladesh border to deliver lifesaving aid.' He also urged the creation of a safe zone for the Rohingya. 'The Rohingya are among the world’s most oppressed. Without action, their situation will worsen. We asked the U.S. and Bangladesh to consider a safe zone, especially as China supports the Myanmar military in U.N. resolutions. If the U.N. fails to act, international cooperation is essential.' Spring Revolution Zar Ni Soe says he sees the nationwide resistance to the military junta – Myanmar's Spring Revolution – that followed the February 2021 coup as a globally transformative movement. 'It’s an example for the world,' he said, comparing it to East Timor’s successful struggle, where people’s determination and strong leadership prevailed. 'For the first time, the military junta, initially 500,000 strong, faces equal opposition,' Zar Ni Soe said, adding he remains confident in the revolution’s ultimate victory. Regarding the Rohingya’s hope to return to northern Rakhine State, he acknowledged difficulties, including reports of some Rohingya collaborating with the junta against the Arakan Army. He emphasized the broader goal of peaceful coexistence: 'Our main desire is harmony among all ethnic groups.' Many Rohingya refugees who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 wish to return peacefully but face barriers because of a lack of mutual willingness to resolve conflicts. Zar Ni Soe stressed that peace requires willingness from all sides. 'If the Rohingya want to return but the other side resists, the conflict will remain unresolved. With mutual cooperation, Rakhine can be rebuilt, and lasting peace achieved,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/young-rohingya-hope-for-peace-in-myanmar-even-as-challenges-persist-/7909091.html	2024-12-20T15:34:04-08:00

1 dead, 50 injured after car crashes into German Christmas market, official says	BERLIN — A car plowed into a busy outdoor Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg on Friday, leaving at least one person dead and injuring at least 50 others in what authorities suspect was an attack. The driver of the car was arrested, German news agency dpa reported, citing unidentified government officials in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The suspect was not known to German authorities as an Islamic extremist, dpa reported, citing unidentified security officials. He is believed to be about 50 years old and to have come from Saudi Arabia. More than 50 people were injured when the car drove into the market, dpa reported. Regional government spokesperson Matthias Schuppe and city spokesperson Michael Reif said they suspected it was a deliberate act. 'The pictures are terrible,' Reif said. 'My information is that a car drove into the Christmas market visitors, but I can't yet say from what direction and how far.' Magdeburg's University Hospital said it was taking care of 10 to 20 patients but was preparing for more, the German Press Agency known as dpa reported. The sounds of sirens from first responders clashed with the market's holiday decorations, including ornaments, stars and leafy garland festooning the vendors' booths. Debris could be seen on the ground in footage of a cordoned-off part of the market. 'A terrible event' The car drove into the market at around 7 p.m., when it was busy with holiday shoppers getting an early start to the weekend. 'This is a terrible event, particularly now in the days before Christmas,' Saxony-Anhalt governor Reiner Haseloff said. Haseloff told dpa that he was on his way to Magdeburg but couldn't immediately give any information on victims or what was behind the incident. Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: 'My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.' Magdeburg, which is west of Berlin, is the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has about 240,000 residents. Attack strikes holiday tradition The suspected attack came eight years after an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. On December 19, 2016, an Islamic extremist plowed through a crowded market with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture as an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-50-injured-after-car-crashes-into-german-christmas-market-official-says-/7909030.html	2024-12-20T14:23:29-08:00	
US flu season is under way, as cases surge in some areas and vaccinations lag	NEW YORK — The U.S. flu season is under way, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits. 'It's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,' said the CDC's Alicia Budd. Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University. 'Flu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,' Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms. Louisiana is another early hot spot. 'Just this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,' said Dr. Catherine O’Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. 'You hear parents saying, ‘I can’t come to work because of the flu’ and ‘Where can I get a flu test?’' There are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly. The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data. RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show. The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, including lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu. No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said. Last winter's flu season was considered 'moderate' overall, but it was long — 21 weeks — and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season. The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations — and for whom their vaccination status was known — 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that’s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data. Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date. Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely. 'All those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,' Schaffner said.

Thailand calls regional talks on war-torn Myanmar frank but short on agreement	BANGKOK — Thailand says regional talks it hosted Friday on a stalled peace plan for Myanmar were 'frank' but reached no consensus on a path forward. Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, gathered in Bangkok to discuss the Five-Point Consensus the bloc agreed to in April 2021, two months after Myanmar’s military seized power from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That coup sparked a civil war that has killed thousands and displaced more than 3 million people. In addition to an immediate cessation of violence and negotiations among 'all parties' to the conflict, the plan calls for the appointment of a special envoy to meet with all sides and assistance from ASEAN’s humanitarian aid agency. Myanmar’s junta did grant a meeting last year between Suu Kyi — who has been held in custody since the coup — and Thailand’s then-foreign minister. Some aid has also trickled in via Thailand under ASEAN’s watch. But the bloc has not appointed a permanent special envoy, and there have been no meaningful negotiations between the junta and its foes as fighting shows no signs of letting up. Friday’s talks followed a meeting in Bangkok on Thursday among Myanmar and its immediate neighbors on cross-border concerns, including crime. After Friday’s meeting, Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura told the press that the talks between the foreign ministers of Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore were 'cordial and very frank.' The bloc’s other members sent delegates but not ministers, he added. Bolbongse Vangphaen, director-general of Thailand’s Department of ASEAN Affairs, said the delegates agreed that the peace plan from 2021 would continue to anchor their efforts. 'The foreign ministers reaffirmed that the … Five-Point Consensus remains the main reference for ASEAN’s efforts in addressing the situation in Myanmar,' he said, adding that 'all recognize that there is a need to step up efforts' to see it through. 'We are aware that there are obstacles to making progress.' As for any broad agreement on how to tackle those obstacles, however, Bolbongse said 'nothing specific' came out of Friday’s talks, and that they would continue at another meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers next month. 'The meeting today was a chance for the foreign ministers and representatives to just sound out ideas and seek various approaches to see … how we could perhaps converge on some common terms to push forward,' he said. 'There’s no clear approach as yet.' David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst, told VOA that Thailand was trying to create momentum on regional efforts after 'another lost year of empty diplomacy.' He called meetings among Myanmar’s immediate neighbors 'crucial' now that the junta has lost control of most borders. Those meetings, he added, are potentially more useful than ASEAN, which generally acts only when all members are in agreement. Like many of the bloc’s critics, he called the Five-Point Consensus 'effectively dead' from the start. 'It’s fundamentally flawed, depending on engaging the [State Administration Council, or SAC], who don’t want to respond,' he said, using the junta’s formal title. 'That’s where all these efforts will fail, ascribing the SAC with reason they don’t possess.' Surachanee Sriyai of Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak institute agreed that the plan 'has never been a viable path' out of the crisis for Myanmar, but at least gives the bloc the semblance of taking collective action while sticking to its norms of acting by consensus and staying out of each other’s affairs. Following Thursday’s meeting, Thailand said junta officials told the group it was open to 'inclusive political dialogue.' Junta officials, however, have labeled many of their opponents 'terrorists' and banned dozens of political parties, including Suu Kyi’s ousted National League for Democracy. Mathieson said any efforts to help Myanmar out of its crisis need to include both the junta and all opponents. That means not only the National Unity Government comprising ousted lawmakers, but all the revolutionary groups now aligned against the junta. Whether together or on their own, Surachanee said, ASEAN members should cultivate relationships with those opposition groups as they continue to gain ground on the junta, which, by some estimates, now controls less than half the country. 'Plenty of [situational reports] have pointed at the SAC losing ground and the ability to govern,' she said. 'In this way, countries, especially Thailand, should look to other alternative counterparts to work with.' Following Friday’s meeting, Bolbongse said other ASEAN members were free to 'engage with whichever groups that they may have influence on' and that those efforts could 'complement each other.' But by focusing their attention on dialogue with the junta, critics say the bloc and most of its members are legitimizing a regime that many if not most in Myanmar consider illegitimate. Asked to respond to the critique, Bolbongse said Thailand was simply engaging in state-to-state dialogue. 'Whether the SAC is seen as legitimate or not, Myanmar as a whole is still a member of ASEAN, so we are engaging with Myanmar,' he said. 'That’s all, thank you.' The junta claims its military is waging a legitimate campaign of proportionate force. But numerous well-documented accounts of violence describe indiscriminate air and artillery attacks, with many destroying churches, schools and clinics. Rights groups allege repeated cases of rape, torture and murder. U.N.-appointed experts and envoys have accused the junta of war crimes and crimes against humanity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-calls-regional-talks-on-war-torn-myanmar-frank-but-short-on-agreement-/7909022.html	2024-12-20T13:36:51-08:00	
Erdogan says Turkey expects allies to pull support from Kurds in post-Assad Syria	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey expects foreign countries will withdraw support for Kurdish fighters in Syria following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, as Ankara seeks to isolate Kurds who have long fought alongside U.S. troops. Germany's foreign minister later said Kurdish forces should disarm and integrate into Syria's national security structure, and Washington's top diplomat for the Middle East said the U.S. was working on a 'managed transition' for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in northern Syria. Speaking to reporters on the flight home from a summit in Egypt on Thursday, Erdogan said there was no longer any reason for outsiders to back Kurdish YPG fighters. His office released his comments Friday. The Kurdish YPG has been the main force in the alliance, but Turkey considers the group an extension of the PKK, which has long fought the Turkish state and is banned as a terrorist group by Ankara, Washington and the EU. In his remarks, Erdogan compared the U.S.-backed YPG to Islamic State, and he said neither group had any future in Syria. 'In the upcoming period, we do not believe that any power will continue to collaborate with terrorist organizations. The heads of terrorist organizations such as Islamic State and PKK/YPG will be crushed in the shortest possible time.' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said after talks with her Turkish counterpart in Ankara that the security of Kurds was essential for a free Syria, but that Turkey's security concerns must also be addressed to ensure stability. 'The Kurdish groups must be disarmed and integrated into the national security structure,' she said. Barbara Leaf, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told reporters after visiting Damascus on Friday that Washington was working with Ankara and the SDF to find 'a managed transition in terms of SDF's role in that part of the country.' 'The conditions which led Kurds in northeast Syria to organize themselves and to defend themselves as they did were one set of conditions, and things have really changed in a very dramatic fashion,' Leaf said. The United States said this week that it has 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria working alongside the YPG-led alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces. The SDF played a major role on the ground defeating Islamic State militants in 2014-17 with U.S. air support and still guards Islamist fighters in prison camps. Ankara, alongside Syrian allies, has mounted several cross-border offensives against the YPG-led SDF in northern Syria, while repeatedly demanding that its NATO ally Washington halt support for the fighters. Hostilities have escalated since Assad was toppled less than two weeks ago, with Turkey and Syrian groups it backs seizing the city of Manbij from the SDF on Dec. 9, prompting the United States to broker a fragile ceasefire. Erdogan told reporters that Turkey wanted to see a new Syria in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in harmony. To achieve this, 'Islamic State, the PKK and its versions which threaten the survival of Syria need to be eradicated,' he said. 'The PKK terrorist organization and its extensions in particular have reached the end of their lifespan,' Erdogan added. On Thursday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi told Reuters that Kurdish fighters from outside Syria who had joined the group's ranks would leave if a truce were agreed with Turkey, long one of Ankara's major demands. In his remarks, Abdi acknowledged for the first time that Kurdish fighters from other countries - including PKK members - had been assisting the SDF, but he said they would no longer be needed under a truce. A Turkish Defense Ministry official said there was no talk of a ceasefire between Turkey and the SDF, adding that Ankara would continue taking counterterrorism measures until 'the PKK/YPG lays down its arms and its foreign fighters leave Syria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-says-turkey-expects-allies-to-pull-support-from-kurds-in-post-assad-syria/7909013.html	2024-12-20T13:19:46-08:00	
East Africa remembers victims of deadly Indian Ocean tsunami	nairobi, kenya — Mwalola wa Mwalola, a longtime fisherman in the Indian Ocean on the Kenyan coast, vividly remembers the events of the deadly tsunami of 20 years ago. Mwalola said the fisherfolk's experience and knowledge of the ocean saved his life after they sensed danger and decided to keep off the ocean on the fateful day. 'My place of work was hit, but I was not affected because I heeded the warning,' he said. 'We avoided losses because we warned our colleagues of the impending danger and asked everyone to keep off the ocean that day.' On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra generated a devastating tsunami that was observed worldwide and caused tremendous devastation and deaths throughout the Indian Ocean region, including in East Africa. Out of the 228,000 people killed, more than 300 were from the East African countries of Somalia, Tanzania and Kenya, according to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The disaster raised awareness about the threat tsunamis pose to coastal communities around the world and the need for improved tsunami detection, forecasting, warning and preparedness. Observers say more remains to be done in the East African countries that were affected. Shamim Wasii Nyanda, an environmental activist at the Tanzania Ocean Climate Innovation Hub in Dar es Salaam, said, 'There’s an increase of vulnerability due to climate change but also ... limited adaptation funding. Most of the coastal cities lack sufficient financial resources to implement these climate adaptation measures, particularly in urban, under-resourced communities. They do not have that kind of technology or resources for them to be able to work on these problems that we are experiencing,' especially tsunamis. Nyanda said increasing urbanization is compounding the risk. 'Coastal cities like Dar es Salaam itself have continued to expand, with informal settlements encroaching on vulnerable areas where facilities like disasterproof housing and infrastructure are not available.' People then build housing in areas where they shouldn't, 'so, when these disasters come, like the tsunami, they are not prepared. They do not have the technology. They do not have the infrastructure … and what happens? They are just swept away.' As countries observe the 20th anniversary of the 2004 tsunami, experts say preparedness, prevention and mitigation measures are key in preventing such disasters in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-africa-remembers-victims-of-deadly-indian-ocean-tsunami-/7908999.html	2024-12-20T13:03:47-08:00	
Teen stabs 7-year-old girl to death at school in Croatia	A 7-year-old girl was stabbed to death Friday at an elementary school in Croatia by a knife-wielding teenager who also wounded three other children and a teacher, officials said. Video footage Friday showed children running away from the school as a medical helicopter was landing. The attacker is a former student of the Precko Elementary School in Zagreb where the attack took place, according to Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic. The teen had a history of mental health issues and after Friday's incident 'shut himself in a nearby health center where he tried to injure himself with the knife,' according to Bozinovic. Police were able to prevent him from committing suicide. Last year, the teen also tried to kill himself, the minister said. 'Five persons have been hospitalized, and their lives are not in danger,' Croatian Health Minister Irena Hrstic said, including the attacker in the count. Leaders declare day of mourning School attacks are rare in Croatia. 'There are no words to describe the grief over the horrible and unthinkable tragedy that shocked us all today,' said President Zoran Milanovic. 'We are horrified,' said Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. Following the assault at the school, Croatian officials declared Saturday as a day of mourning. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-stabs-croatian-7-year-old-to-death-at-school/7908973.html	2024-12-20T13:02:13-08:00	
Hostage envoy: Syria’s vast secret prison network complicates efforts to find Austin Tice	WASHINGTON — A network of secret prisons run by the former Syrian government is more extensive than the U.S. had realized, and is complicating efforts to find American journalist Austin Tice, the U.S. hostage envoy said Friday. The U.S. government initially estimated Syria had around 10 to 20 secret prisons, but there may be 40 or more, the chief envoy for hostage negotiations Roger Carstens told reporters Friday, following a brief trip to the Syrian capital, Damascus. 'I’ve been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said, referring to former President Bashar al-Assad. 'They’re in little clusters at times. Sometimes they’re in the far reaches of Damascus.' The scale of the prison network has made it harder to locate Tice, according to Carstens. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him. Over the past 12 years, the U.S. government has pinpointed about six prisons where Tice was believed to have likely been, Carstens said. But new information means as many as three more facilities have been added to the list. Limited resources makes checking them a difficult endeavor, Carstens said. In the absence of sufficient U.S. government personnel on the ground, non-governmental organizations, journalists and Syria's transitional government have been searching for Tice. 'In a perfect world, we’ll find Austin and bring him home, and we’ll stop the search,' Carstens said. 'We’re not going to stop until we find the information we need to conclude what has happened to Austin, where he is, to return him home to his family.' One of the nonprofits involved in the search, Hostage Aid Worldwide, has a team on the ground in Syria. The group’s president, Nizar Zakka, told VOA one barrier is not having enough people to help with the searches. 'It’s ridiculous,' Zakka said. 'I need a team.' In the aftermath of the Assad government’s collapse this month, thousands of prisoners have been released from facilities run by the government. That has raised hopes among the Tice family that Austin will be among them. 'I feel like we’re standing in line, and we’re not the only ones that are still standing in line,' Tice’s mother Debra told reporters Monday. 'We just need to get all those prisons opened, get all those families reunited, including us.' Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who worked for outlets including The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. He is the longest-held American journalist abroad. Shortly before the Assad government fell, the Tice family revealed that it had received information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirmed Austin was alive and held in the Damascus area. Last week, Debra Tice wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asking Israel to pause strikes in a part of Syria where her son may be held. Debra Tice told the Israeli leader her family had 'credible information' that her son may be held in a prison in the mountains outside Damascus underneath a military museum. Asked whether the U.S. government had received any new information that would reinforce the belief that Tice was still alive, Carstens said, 'The information that we have right now doesn't confirm either one way or the other.' Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden said he believed Tice was still alive and that the United States was committed to securing his release. The president did not elaborate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hostage-envoy-syria-s-vast-secret-prison-network-complicates-efforts-to-find-austin-tice/7908975.html	2024-12-20T13:00:58-08:00	
UN official calls for end to siege of El Fasher in Sudan's North Darfur	GENEVA — United Nations human rights chief Volker Türk is calling for an end to the siege of El Fasher in Sudan's North Darfur state, which has resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries, and the widespread destruction of homes and infrastructure. 'The continuing siege of El Fasher and the relentless fighting are devastating lives everyday on a massive scale,' Türk said in a statement Friday to coincide with the release of a report describing the devastating impact of the seven-month-long siege of El Fasher in Sudan by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. 'This alarming situation cannot continue. The Rapid Support Forces must end the horrible siege. And I urge all parties to the conflict to stop attacks on civilians and civilian objects … and to comply with their obligations and commitments under international law,' he said. Since the siege of El Fasher, the capital of Sudan's North Darfur state, began in May, the report finds at least 782 civilians have been killed and more than 1,143 injured. Fighting displaces millions The RSF and Sudan National Forces have been battling for control of the country since April 2023. Since the RSF and Sudanese warlords made a power grab, plunging the country into chaos, more than 11.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes. About 8.5 million are displaced inside Sudan. Another 3 million have fled as refugees to neighboring countries. Additionally, the United Nations reports more than half of Sudan's population or 26.5 million are suffering from acute hunger, with thousands on the brink of famine. Authors of the report say the findings indicate a persistent disregard of international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict, 'as evidenced by the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated urban areas and direct attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including attacks on health facilities.' Seif Magango, a spokesperson for human rights chief Türk, told journalists in Geneva on Friday that the RSF, Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and their allies 'have turned the city into a battleground' from which there is no escape. 'There has been regular and intense shelling by the RSF of densely populated residential areas, recurrent airstrikes by the SAF, and artillery shelling by both the SAF and its Allied Joint Forces. 'Residential neighborhoods, markets, hospitals and camps hosting internally displaced people have been struck,' Magango said. Survivors who fled El Fasher have testified that intense artillery shelling by the RSF on densely populated residential areas and recurrent airstrikes by the SAF and Joint Forces 'in most cases were conducted without warning despite the presence of thousands of civilians.' The U.N. human rights report accuses the warring parties of the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It says the Zamzam Camp, which hosts hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people, and where famine has been declared, has been shelled repeatedly. It says the Abu Shouk IDP camp, northwest of El Fasher, housing more than 100,000 internally displaced people from African tribes, has been subjected to recurrent artillery shelling by the RSF, 'amounting to direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects.' Between May 9 and November 28, the U.N. human rights office has documented 13 attacks on health facilities, most attributed to and 'deliberately targeted' by the RSF. For example, it notes the Al-Saudi Maternity Hospital, in western El Fasher, 'has been repeatedly shelled since the start of the hostilities.' 'This is the last remaining public hospital in the city with the capacity to perform surgery and provide sexual and reproductive health services, including necessary medical care for survivors of sexual violence,' it says, noting that 'this is particularly tragic as there has been a surge in cases of sexual violence since the siege began.' Monitors track sexual violence reports Human rights monitors have documented numerous reports of sexual violence against women and girls during the siege and as they fled El Fasher after May 2024. The report quotes a reliable source who says the 20 to 40 victims of sexual violence reaching service providers each month 'is considered to be significantly underreported due to stigma and artillery shelling that restricted movement.' 'Attacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes,' Magango said. 'This alarming situation cannot be allowed to continue. All parties to the conflict must refrain from attacks on civilians and civilian objects and respect international law.' The report's authors express concern about a buildup of SAF-allied Joint Forces in the densely populated Zamzam camp. This, coupled with the increased mobilization of fighters along tribal lines across Darfur, they say, 'indicates preparations for further hostilities may be under way.' 'Any large-scale attack on Zamzam camp and El Fasher city will catapult civilian suffering to catastrophic levels, deepening the already dire humanitarian situation, including famine conditions,' warned High Commissioner Türk in Friday's statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-official-calls-for-end-to-siege-of-el-fasher-in-sudan-s-north-darfur-/7908880.html	2024-12-20T12:15:35-08:00	
Taiwan lawmakers brawl over bills that would 'damage democracy'	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese lawmakers tackled and doused each other with water on Friday as President Lai Ching-te's party tried to block the passage of bills they say could harm the self-ruled island's 'democratic system.' Scores of lawmakers from Lai's Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, occupied the podium of the parliament's main chamber since Thursday night and barricaded themselves inside — piling up chairs to block entrances. The DPP parliamentarians were attempting to stop three legal amendments proposed by the opposition bloc that would make it more difficult for voters to oust elected officials who they see as unfit. 'Parliamentary dictatorship,' some DPP lawmakers shouted to criticize the opposition Kuomintang, or KMT, party and its ally Taiwan People's Party, or TPP, for trying to pass the bills with their majority. 'If the KMT forcefully passes the amendments ... Taiwan's democratic self-checking and self-repairing mechanism will be gone, and it will also cause significant and irreversible damage to Taiwan's civil society and democratic system,' the ruling party said in a statement. 'At a time when Taiwan's democracy is being violated and damaged, we must stand up and take action,' it said. Among the disputed bills was a planned revision to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act pressed ahead by the KMT and TPP to raise the threshold for removing elected officials. The Beijing-friendly KMT said it would prevent the power of recalls from 'being abused,' but some DPP lawmakers said they fear the move would revoke voters' rights to remove unfit officials. Han Kuo-yu, the current parliament speaker from the KMT, was ousted in 2020 as mayor of southern Kaohsiung city following a failed presidential bid. Outside the parliament on Friday, thousands of people gathered to protest the bills, shouting 'return the evil amendments' and 'defend Taiwan.' 'I am here to protest the opposition parties for trying to confiscate the people's rights to recall,' graduate student David Chen told AFP. Earlier this year, reform bills expanding parliament's powers pushed by the opposition sparked brawls among lawmakers and massive street demonstrations. Proponents of the expansion say it is needed to curb corruption, but critics fear the laws could weaken Taiwan's democracy against the influence of China, which claims the island as part of its territory. In October, Taiwan's Constitutional Court struck out the most controversial sections of the law, delivering a partial victory to the DPP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-lawmakers-brawl-over-bills-that-would-damage-democracy-/7908822.html	2024-12-20T11:26:49-08:00

Elon Musk considers funding Nigel Farage's populist party in UK	LONDON — It’s a photo that sent a tremor through British politics: Elon Musk flanked by British politician Nigel Farage and a wealthy backer, in front of a gilt-framed painting of a young Donald Trump. Taken this week at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the image suggested that Musk, a key player in the incoming U.S. administration, could soon turn his disruptive attention to the U.K. Farage, Trump’s highest-profile British champion, confirmed talks are under way about Musk making a hefty donation to Farage's party, Reform U.K. The Times of London reported it could be as much as $100 million, which would be far and away the largest political donation in U.K. history. The reports have sparked calls for Britain’s rules on political donations to be tightened — quickly. 'We did discuss money,' Farage told broadcaster GB News after the meeting with Musk. 'That’s a negotiation we will go back and have again. He is not against giving us money. He hasn’t fully decided whether he will.' Britain has strict limits on how much political parties can spend on elections, but they can accept unlimited donations, as long as the donors are U.K. voters or companies registered in Britain. Musk’s social network X has a British arm, Twitter U.K. Ltd., with a registered address in London. Critics say that’s a loophole that allows foreign influence in U.K. politics. The voting watchdog, the Electoral Commission, is calling for changes, including limiting the amount a company can donate to how much it earns in Britain. 'It’s crucial that U.K. voters have trust in the financing of our political system,' the commission's chief executive, Vijay Rangarajan, told The Guardian. 'The system needs strengthening, and we have been calling for changes to the law since 2013, to protect the electoral system from foreign interference.' Britain’s center-left Labour Party pledged during the summer election campaign to tighten the rules on political donations, although legislation is not scheduled in the coming year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson Dave Pares said Wednesday that work is already under way to 'reinforce existing safeguards' against 'impermissible proxy donations.' The Labour government and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives are trying to figure out how to deal with Musk, who has taken a keen interest in the U.K. — and seemingly formed a strong dislike for Starmer. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir — shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing,' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Musk has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation to the Soviet Union, and during summer anti-immigrant violence across the U.K. tweeted that 'civil war is inevitable.' Farage has echoed some of those themes in his own social media output and his party’s anti-'woke' agenda, which includes pledges to slash immigration, scrap green-energy targets and leave the European Convention on Human Rights. Founded in 2021, Reform U.K. is the latest in a string of small hard-right parties led by Farage that have had limited electoral success but an outsized influence on British politics. Farage’s opposition to the European Union helped push the country toward voting in 2016 to leave the bloc, a seismic political and economic break with the U.K.’s nearest neighbors. Reform U.K. won just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons in July’s election, but it came second in dozens more and secured 14% of the vote. Now it is pushing for fast growth, trying to professionalize its previously ramshackle organization and holding gatherings around the U.K. to recruit new members. Farage, a strong communicator who has embraced TikTok and other platforms, aims to emulate Trump’s success in using the power of personality and social media to reach the 'bro vote' — young men who are traditionally less likely to turn out at election time. Farage told GB News that Musk has 'already given me considerable help – understanding the process from start to finish, reaching disaffected communities who frankly feel there’s no point voting for anybody.' The electoral power of social media was on show recently in Romania, where far-right candidate Calin Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round of the presidential election in November, aided in part by a flood of TikTok videos promoting his campaign. Amid allegations that Russia had organized the social media campaign to back Georgescu, Romania’s Constitutional Court canceled the presidential election runoff two days before it was due to take place. With Britain’s Conservative Party trying to recover from its worst election result since 1832, Farage dreams of making Reform the main opposition — or even the government — after the next election, due by 2029. That’s a long shot, but Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said a big donation from Musk could have 'disruptive potential in all sorts of ways.' He said Musk’s money would give Reform 'the opportunity to try and build up a serious campaign organization, which is something that they have generally lacked.' 'It’s certainly adding a new joker to the pack of cards in British politics,' Ford said. 'We’ve had no shortage of surprising developments here in the past few years. And maybe this is the next one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-considers-funding-nigel-farage-s-populist-party-in-uk/7908618.html	2024-12-20T09:06:51-08:00	
US hostage envoy arrives in Syria as part of search for Austin Tice	WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. diplomats were in Syria to hold talks Friday with the country’s new leaders and seek information about the whereabouts of detained American journalist Austin Tice, following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf, former special envoy for Syria Daniel Rubinstein, and the Biden administration’s chief envoy for hostage negotiations, Roger Carstens, are scheduled to hold talks with Syria’s interim leaders, the State Department said early Friday. 'They hope to uncover information about the fate of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime,' a State Department spokesperson said. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine turned journalist, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him since. The longest-held American journalist abroad, Tice freelanced for outlets including The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy. Kamalmaz, a Syrian-American psychologist who was treating refugees from the war-torn country, was stopped at a government checkpoint in 2017. He had traveled to Syria to check on an elderly relative. In May 2024, the U.S. learned Kamalmaz had died in custody. In a statement released in June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, 'The Syrian government must answer for what happened to Majd.' His family in July filed a lawsuit against the Syrian government for wrongful death and false imprisonment. The fall of the Assad government this month has fostered cautious optimism among Tice’s family that he will be among the thousands of prisoners being released. 'What we’re hoping is that as people that are coming into Damascus are opening the prisons, that, by the power of God, they’ll open the one that Austin’s in,' Tice’s mother Debra told VOA last week. Tice’s family said this month that it has received credible information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirms Tice is alive and indicates he may be detained in the Damascus area. The U.S. government has said it believes that Tice is still alive and that locating his whereabouts is a priority. Syria’s transitional government has said the search for Tice is ongoing. The trip Friday is the first time American diplomats have formally visited Syria in more than a decade. The U.S. closed its embassy in Damascus in 2012. 'They will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the State Department spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-hostage-envoy-arrives-in-syria-as-part-of-search-for-austin-tice/7908566.html	2024-12-20T08:23:22-08:00	
Trump wants to quickly end Gaza war. Can he?	President-elect Donald Trump has signaled an eagerness to see the conflict in Gaza end quickly, saying, 'All hell is going to break out' if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day he takes office. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara looks at prospects for peace as the outgoing Biden administration pushes for a ceasefire deal.

Israeli settlers accused of setting fire to and vandalizing West Bank mosque	Palestinian residents in Israel’s occupied West Bank city of Marda reported Friday that Israeli settlers set fire to and vandalized a mosque, writing slurs and threatening slogans in spray paint on its walls. In security video taken from the scene, a masked and hooded person can be seen spray-painting the walls of the mosque. At least two others join the person, one of them carrying what appears to be a large jug or container as they head into the building. Among the messages sprayed on the wall were 'Death to Arabs,' and 'the righteous will rejoice because he sees revenge,' a quote from the Hebrew Bible's book of Psalms. In a video statement Friday, Marda village council chief Nasfat al-Khufash called it a systematic terror attack. 'A number of settlers set fire and attempted an attack on a wider scale on the mosque,' he said. 'These attacks are continuous and systematic by settler groups.' Israeli police and the Israeli security agency Shin Bet security services said in a joint statement: 'We see this incident as extremely serious and will act resolutely to bring the perpetrators to justice for rigorous trial.' Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported, in a statement posted to the social media platform X, Israeli Air Force fighter jets — under the direction of Israeli intelligence and the Israeli Navy — struck Houthi militant targets overnight on the western coast of Yemen as well as deeper in the country. The statement said it hit fuel and oil tanks, two power plants and eight tugboats. The IDF said hitting the targets 'severely harms the military operations of the Houthi forces.' The IDF said the Iranian-backed Houthi militants have 'carried out repeated attacks on the State of Israel, in which unmanned aerial vehicles and surface-to-surface missiles were launched toward the country's territory.' Also Friday, Sweden announced it was ending funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees — known as UNRWA. Sweden’s international aid chief, Benjamin Dousa, made the announcement on Swedish television, saying the decision came following Israeli lawmakers passing a ban on the agency from working in Gaza. Israel has long claimed UNRWA was a front for terrorists. Sweden said it plans to increase its aid to Gaza in the next year but will do so through other aid agencies. In a statement Friday, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini called the decision 'disappointing' and said it comes at the worst time for Palestine refugees. The agency chief said it will double the suffering the people of Gaza have 'endured over the past 14 months since the horrendous Hamas attack on 7 October and the ongoing war.' Lazzerini said he hopes Sweden reconsiders its decision. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain, the European Union and others.

Interview: Biden administration pushes for Sudan ceasefire in remaining weeks	UNITED NATIONS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $200 million in new humanitarian funding for the Sudanese people at a high-level Sudan meeting he chaired Thursday at the U.N. Security Council, bringing total U.S. support to Sudan to more than $2.3 billion since fighting began among rival generals in April 2023. U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello spoke to VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer on the sidelines of the council meeting. He said the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden wants to consolidate humanitarian progress and move toward a ceasefire, even a temporary one, in its remaining weeks. Once allies in Sudan's transitional government after a 2021 coup, Sudanese Armed Forces General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Rapid Support Forces General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo have become bitter rivals for power. Fighting erupted between their forces in the capital, Khartoum, last year. It has since spread across Sudan, causing widespread atrocities and killing, and one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello, thank you for talking to VOA today. You have one month to go for the Biden administration. What do you realistically think you can achieve in the remaining weeks on Sudan? U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello: Well, one of the things that Secretary Blinken made clear today at the United Nations is that we're going to use every second we've got, and we've got some momentum. We're in the fifth straight month of breaking the largest humanitarian embargo in the world, but we have so much more to do. We've seen four times more food and medicine moving into Sudan than we saw just a few months ago, and each one of those is food and medicine reaching a mother or a child that's been malnourished for months in places like Zamzam camp or Kadugli in South Kordofan. We're getting the convoys moving, including the first convoy into parts of southern Khartoum since the war began almost two years ago. So, we have got a lock in those humanitarian gains that are saving lives. But ultimately, we've got to move towards a ceasefire, even a temporary ceasefire, from the parties, to give some relief to the horrific conditions that millions of Sudanese people are facing. VOA: And how do you hope to move toward that temporary ceasefire? Might you convene another meeting of the ALPS [Aligned for Advancing Lifesaving and Peace in Sudan] before January 20th? Perriello: I just came yesterday from Mauritania, where we were meeting with the African Union, the United Nations, the Arab League and others, about how we can move towards expanding both local and national ceasefire efforts. It was a big statement for Secretary Blinken to sit at the council today in the U.N. And you heard from the Algerians and the other African leaders this idea that we've got to give more urgency to this ceasefire. ... This famine and this war was a war of choice by men who were willing to let the Sudanese people suffer, and those same men can help bring it to an end if we can get the regional actors in Africa and in the Gulf to align on an effort to put a pause in the fighting and restore the civilian transition. VOA: Would you say the two generals are the biggest obstacle to peace? Is this just about their egos? Or does it go deeper? Perriello: Well, certainly it was a big part of what started this war. But really, you have to go back a few steps and remember it was Generals Hemeti [Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo] and [Abdel Fattah] al-Burhan joining forces to overthrow the civilian transition that had inspired the world in 2019. And there are many forces behind both of them that want to prevent the people of Sudan from having the power over their future. And we continue to see that with extremist groups and others who want to profit from this war, whether it's groups like the National Congress party of the former Bashir era, that know the people wouldn't support them having power, and they're using this war to come back to power. We see some of the tribal leaders who should be some of the strongest voices for peace, instead of figuring out how to profit off of the famine and off of the war, we see countries that have engaged and are willing to continue to see that suffering of the Sudanese people. But we've also seen neighboring countries show the welcomeness ... to accept millions of refugees. We've seen efforts in the region to work with us on these local ceasefire efforts, including some of these humanitarian corridors. So, it's important that we not use the level of the crisis as an excuse to do nothing, because when we've engaged, we've been able to make a difference. And I think that's what Secretary Blinken was trying to remind the council today. VOA: What will it take to get the two generals to the negotiating table? Perriello: Well, first of all, I think we'll continue to try to push them to the table, but what we showed with the ALPS efforts in Switzerland on humanitarian access is you don't need a table anymore. We have telephones. We have proximity talks. What we need is the political will, and we appreciate that countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt and others are continuing to try to support these peace efforts. We think the African Union has a role to play. And the American people, in the same way we've seen Americans show just so much compassion in crisis after crisis around the world, we need folks to see these young people with the Mutual Aid Sudan and elsewhere that are risking their lives to get food and medicine into their communities. They need that support and attention from us. It's also something, quite frankly, that has really strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, including from a recent letter this week from both Republican and Democratic senators trying to draw more attention to the crisis in Sudan. So, it needs all of us to pay more attention, but most of all, it needs the people with guns and the people supplying guns to all sides in Sudan, to put those down and become partners in peace. VOA: You mentioned, and Secretary Blinken mentioned in the council, that there's a lot of external interference in the war in Sudan. There's credible evidence the UAE has been fueling the violence and supplying the RSF with arms. Why has the Biden administration been reluctant to really exert significant public pressure on the UAE? Perriello: Well, you saw some powerful testimony today at the Security Council about this issue, about foreign interference and the role certain countries are playing to fuel this conflict. The Biden administration has really led the way on putting pressure on all of the external actors to stop fueling this war and inviting them to be partners in peace, both ending the famine and trying to end this war. [U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.] Linda Thomas-Greenfield helped push for an extension of the Darfur arms embargo — and also the first sanctions for violating that arms embargo in over 15 years. We are going to continue with our sanctions and with our diplomacy to raise the costs of those that are fueling this conflict, but also to continue to invite in those who want to be partners for not just peace for the Sudanese people, but how we rebuild Sudan and how we restore that civilian transition. Secretary Blinken announced today an additional $30 million with Congress to support civil society, particularly women and youth, who have continued to inspire us in Sudan, to help rebuild that political dialogue and that path — the only real path forward — which is a unified civilian front into peace and democracy. VOA: There are reports that the State Department is considering a genocide declaration. Why the reluctance to use the 'genocide' word? Perriello: Far from reluctance, the State Department's really been leading the way. I mean, as someone who was in Darfur more than 20 years ago when the genocide was happening. When I was out of government a year ago, I was proud that the State Department led the way on declaring the acts of ethnic cleansing that we heard about from the Sultan of the Masalit today. Called out the crimes against humanity. We'll continue to look at where the facts lead in terms of other designations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/interview-biden-administration-pushes-for-sudan-ceasefire-in-remaining-weeks-/7908494.html	2024-12-20T07:21:21-08:00	
Mozambique begins building shelter for victims of Cyclone Chido	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Mozambique began constructing homes for victims of Cyclone Chido this week after the storm swept through three of the country's northern regions Sunday, killing at least 70 people and injuring 600 others as it left behind a trail of destruction. On a visit to affected areas, Trade and Industry Minister Silvino Moreno said that the government is working to provide aid to storm victims and that international partners are pitching in to help. Addressing the media after a stop in the province of Nampula, one of the regions affected by the cyclone, Moreno said the priority is constructing shelter with resilient materials. He said the goal is to avoid the destruction of homes built with poor material. Almost all of the houses in affected areas were constructed with mud and reeds that never stood a chance against the powerful cyclone. Moreno said the people need better construction training. Before hitting Mozambique, Cyclone Chido caused significant devastation in Mayotte, a set of French islands. This resulted in fatalities, infrastructure damage and increased risks for vulnerable communities, including asylum-seekers and refugees, according to humanitarian agencies. In southern Malawi, the storm brought strong winds and rains, leading to the destruction of houses and infrastructure in several areas. Mozambique’s meteorology agency said the country should expect more storms during the next three months of the rainy season and called for better preparation. According to UNICEF, at least 174,000 people have been affected overall, but the numbers may increase as assessments continue. In addition to homes damaged, at least several thousand classrooms were destroyed and 20 health facilities hit. UNICEF’s field office head in Mozambique’s Zambezia province, Michael Chimedza, told VOA that his organization has requisitioned items so it can immediately respond to 50,000 people. He said the agency has provided funds for response training at the local level. Besides Nampula, the cyclone tore through Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, leaving more than 25,000 families without electricity and damaging key infrastructure, including health units, roads and water supply sources. In a region already fighting a cholera outbreak, the latest devastation creates an ominous likelihood that the outbreak will further worsen, aid agencies said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-begins-building-shelter-for-victims-of-cyclone-chido/7908468.html	2024-12-20T07:07:43-08:00	
Africa's changing political scenes, laws spark disputes with mining firms	Nairobi — Africa's mining sector is witnessing a surge in legal disputes in the Sahel and Central Africa, as mining companies face increasing scrutiny in the countries in which they operate. The disputes stem from tax and customs audits, and a lack of expertise in managing finance, arbitration, and change in legislations in some countries. In a statement Wednesday, officials with the Barrick Gold Corporation said its operating entities in Mali submitted a request for arbitration to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, to address the disagreement with the Mali government regarding the Loulo-Gounkoto complex. Barrick, the world’s second-largest gold miner, and the Mali military government have been in a dispute over new mining rules since 2023. The new rules seek to give the state and local private investors a 35 percent interest in mining projects, up from 20 percent. The International Arbitration, or ICSID, registered cases in six sub-Saharan countries this year: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Senegal, South Sudan, and Tanzania. Of the cases filed by investors and countries, 28 percent were in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, the highest. Beverly Ochieng is a senior analyst with Control Risks, a firm specializing in political, security, and integrity risks. She says inward-looking countries and mineral rights are causing authorities to clash with mining firms. 'Across the continent, there has been this bigger drive toward resource nationalism whereby countries feel that because they are the biggest stakeholders of those resources, whether its gold, zinc, uranium, they ought to put in legislation or update their legislation to make sure that the government earns a lot more. So, it hasn’t quite led to disputes in other countries in a way it publicly played out in Mali, but it is bound to raise some concerns on how that transition happens,' said Ochieng. Mining experts argue that political instability, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, changes in mining laws and alliances have affected companies that have been mining in those countries for decades. Some countries have shut down mining sites because of alleged environmental damage and failure to remit taxes to the government. Disputes between companies and states arise from changes in government, insecurity, political instability, tax evasion, tribal authority, and environmental and social issues. Paul Ogendi teaches law at the University of Nairobi. He says strong governance and rule of law are crucial for effective dispute resolution and preventing conflict and suffering. 'We need to have the governance structure operating so that the judiciary and other arbitration or other dispute mechanisms can operate,' he said. 'If we don’t have strong governance and institutions, particularly working under the rule of law, it will be a waste of time to go to court or any other forum to arbitrate or resolve your dispute because the players will ignore it and will continue destabilizing the region and this will continue to spur a conflict and the suffering of the people.' Geopolitical tensions are also influencing some African countries' decisions to deny or revoke licenses of some companies and give them to their newfound friends, like China and Russia. Ochieng says African nations are diversifying partnerships, while Western operators face regulatory challenges as new players reshape the landscape. 'It also allows African countries to diversify their partners and to strengthen their own resources,' he said. 'It will take a very long time for that to happen, but it’s not necessarily the biggest threat for Western operators. For Western operators it’s the issue of compliance and ensuring they have an understanding of how these governments, various governments have various factors of compliance that they need to adhere to. The emergence of a new place is definitely going to change that environment, and it's going to be seen as an opportunity or a threat depending on who is assessing it.' The ICSID says 88 proceedings were concluded in 2024. Of these, 71 percent were settled by the tribunal, and 29 percent were settled or proceedings discontinued. This year, Tanzania reached an agreement with Canadian company Montero Mining and Exploration Limited over a licensing dispute and agreed to pay $27 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-s-changing-political-scenes-laws-spark-disputes-with-mining-firms-/7908471.html	2024-12-20T07:06:15-08:00

Myanmar military appears to be using Thai fisherman as leverage, experts say	Myanmar’s recent arrest and sentencing of four Thai fishermen has heightened tensions between the Southeast Asian neighbors with some analysts telling VOA the move appears to be aimed at gaining legitimacy and recognition ahead of high-level government meetings in Bangkok this week. Earlier this week, a Myanmar court in Kawthoung sentenced the owner of a seized fishing vessel to six years in prison, and three other fisherman received four-year prison terms. The sentencing comes as Thailand’s foreign ministry continues talks for their release and as Myanmar is the focus of high-level government meetings in Bangkok. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist in Bangkok at Chulalongkorn University tells VOA that it’s clear that Myanmar is using the fishermen to leverage its own interests. 'The detention of Thai fisherman is designed to gain leverage over the Thai government in return for more official engagement and recognition of the State Administration Council,' Thitinan said. The State Administration Council, or SAC, is the official name of Myanmar’s military led government. 'This makes Thailand look kind of weak. This has been going on for some time, it’s not the first time for sure, but suddenly it has become a thorny issue,' Thitinan said. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics, agrees. 'I think that the generals, in their Neanderthal-ish way, are using them to maintain Thailand’s full support,' he said, adding that it risks backfiring if they hold the fishermen too long. 'The Thai government is as supportive of the junta as it could be, but there will be a public backlash at some point.' Myanmar’s military led government has said little about the sentencing of the fishermen or when they might be released. VOA reached out to the SAC for comment but as of press has not received a response. Fishing disputes have long been a point of friction between the two countries but late last month Myanmar’s navy fired upon 15 Thai fishing vessels on the west coast off Ranong province in southern Thailand. Both Thai and Myanmar authorities blame each other for the incident. Dominic Thomson, regional director of Southeast Asia for the Environmental Justice Foundation, says the incident was the first of its kind in a long time. 'There have been no reports of similar incidences since at least 2015. The nature of the incident, coupled with the detention of the fishing vessels and crew is unprecedented,' he told VOA via in an emailed response earlier this month. One Thai national drowned during the altercation, while four Thai crew members were detained along with 27 Myanmar nationals. Myanmar authorities also seized one fishing vessel, the Sor Charoenchai 8. Fast forward two weeks and Bangkok is now hosting two meetings with representatives from Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, India, Laos and Malaysia. The meetings are focused on border security, transnational crime, ASEAN and the Myanmar’s crisis. The first meeting in Bangkok was held on Thursday. On Friday, a meeting centering on ASEAN’s role on Myanmar’s crisis is set to take place. The recent maritime altercation has added to bilateral tensions between Thailand and Myanmar’s military government ahead of the meetings. Nearly four years after the Min Aung Hlaing and his troops staged a coup in February 2021, removing the democratically elected government, Myanmar is in a state of nationwide conflict. Over the past year, the junta has been losing territory, with pro-democracy and ethnic armed groups in coalition to defeat military rule. Over 60% of Myanmar is not under the military’s control. At the same time, Myanmar is under increasing pressure to end the violence and hold an election next year. Thitinan says for Thailand to engage the Myanmar junta in such a high-level way is 'problematic' and that it’s no surprise that the Myanmar military is dragging the fisherman issue on. 'The question is why Thailand is suddenly giving in to this demand and leverage from the [State Administration Council]. The SAC is playing hardball here, to get recognition for legitimacy, and Thailand is playing along,' he said. The fisherman case dragging on is not surprising, the SAC is going to drag it on and milk it. It is surprising because in the medium long term it is detrimental. Engaging the SAC is very problematic because they are losing the civil war, and the future of Myanmar is not in favor of the SAC,' he added. For their part, Thai officials have sought to play down the incident. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra says relations between Myanmar and Thailand remain strong, according to She said the four fishermen will be released on January 4, which, if it goes through, will be exactly five weeks since they were detained. Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura speaking on behalf of Thailand’s Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa says fisherman issue has already been discussed between the two countries in Thursday’s meeting. 'Our Thai Foreign Minister also had the opportunity to have bilateral meetings with the Myanmar foreign minister. They discussed key issues such as regarding the case of the four Thai fisherman,' Nikorndej told a press conference. 'The Thai Foreign Minister receives official assurance from the Myanmar side that all four Thai nationals will be released soon. Both countries will cooperate in promoting understanding and preventing recurrence of issues of the same nature,' he said. Thitinan, however, believes the meetings in Bangkok may not be the end of the issue. 'I would not be surprised if the Foreign Minister of Thailand Maris goes over to Naypyitaw next week or the coming days to clear up this issue,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-military-appears-to-be-using-thai-fisherman-as-leverage-experts-say-/7908345.html	2024-12-20T05:57:34-08:00	
Elon Musk gives nod to German far-right party as election looms	U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, set to join President-elect Donald Trump's administration, waded into Germany's election campaign on Friday, calling the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) the country's savior. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a center-right or center-left majority, but Germany's mainstream, more centrist parties have vowed to shun support from the AfD at national level. Europe's leading power is expected to vote on February 23 after a center-left coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. 'Only the AfD can save Germany,' Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform, X. Musk, the world's richest person, has already expressed support for other anti-immigration parties across Europe. The German government said it had taken note of Musk's post but declined to give any further comment at its regular press conference. Musk reposted a message by German right-wing influencer Naomi Seibt that criticized Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate for the conservatives, who are comfortably ahead in surveys. Musk had already voiced support for the AfD last year, when he attacked the German government's handling of illegal migration. Last month, Musk called for the sacking of Italian judges who had questioned the legality of government measures to prevent irregular immigration. And this week Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's right-wing Reform UK party and friend of Trump, posted a photo of himself and Reform's treasurer meeting Musk at Trump's Florida residence, and said he was in talks with Musk about financial support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-gives-nod-to-german-far-right-party-as-election-looms-/7908237.html	2024-12-20T03:51:23-08:00	
Russia hands 16-year prison term to east Ukraine resident for 'treason'	Moscow — Russia on Friday sentenced a resident of east Ukraine's Lugansk region to 16 years in prison for 'high treason,' Moscow's FSB security service said. Moscow regularly hands heavy sentences to people it accuses of spying for Ukraine and has also consistently imprisoned Ukrainians in Russia and occupied regions. The sentencing came as President Vladimir Putin called on security services to be 'tough' in anti-terror measures and especially vigilant in military counterintelligence as the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive drags on for almost three years. Putin called for special services to 'identify spies and traitors' and to 'stop the work of foreign security services.' The unnamed man was sentenced Friday by a military court in Russia's southern city of Rostov-on-Don. Prosecutors said he had handed information on the Russian armed forces to Kyiv's security services. The FSB, cited by Russian news agencies, said the man was found guilty of state treason, being an accomplice in terrorist acts as well as the illegal handling and transport of explosives. The court ordered that he serve his sentence in a high-security penal colony. The Tass news agency published a video showing the man's arrest, in which FSB officers stopped a car, dragged a man out and threw him to the ground, before handcuffing him and taking him to the local headquarters of the security force. The video showed a man with his face blurred — filmed by the FSB — saying he had been recruited by Ukraine's SBU security service in 2016. Russia regularly releases confession videos filmed by the FSB after arrests. Russian independent media reported that an activist had killed himself Thursday in a Rostov detention center, shortly after being sentenced to 16 years in prison also in the Rostov region. The Mediazona website said it got confirmation from prison officials that Roman Shved — a 39-year-old anarchist sentenced for an arson attack on a government building after the Kremlin announced a military mobilization in 2022 — had died in a Rostov detention center. Several social media channels had said Shved had killed himself hours after being sentenced. Russia has punished thousands of its citizens for opposing the Ukraine campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-hands-16-year-prison-term-to-east-ukraine-resident-for-treason-/7908213.html	2024-12-20T03:15:03-08:00	
Russian missiles target Kyiv after Ukraine fires US-made missiles across the border	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian ballistic missile attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv early Friday killed at least one person and injured nine others, officials said. Moscow claimed it was in response to a Ukrainian strike on Russian soil using American-made weapons. At least three loud blasts were heard in Kyiv shortly before sunrise. Ukraine's air force said it intercepted five Iskander short-range ballistic missiles fired at the city. The attack knocked out heating to 630 residential buildings, 16 medical facilities, and 30 schools and kindergartens, the city administration said, and falling missile debris caused damage and sparked fires in three districts. 'We ask citizens to immediately respond to reports of ballistic attack threats, because there is very little time to find shelter,' the air force said. During the almost three years since the war began Russia has regularly bombarded civilian areas of Ukraine, often in an attempt to cripple the power grid and unnerve Ukrainians. Meanwhile Ukraine, struggling to hold back Russia's bigger army on the front line, has attempted to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The Russian Ministry of Defense said the strike was in response to a Ukrainian missile attack on Russia's Rostov border region two days earlier. That attack used six American-made Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, missiles and four Storm Shadow air-launched missiles provided by the United Kingdom, it said. That day, Ukraine claimed to have targeted a Rostov oil refinery as part of its campaign to strike Russian infrastructure supporting the country's war effort. The use of Western-supplied weapons to strike Russia has angered the Kremlin. Ukraine fired several American-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time on Nov. 19 after Washington eased restrictions on their use. That development prompted Russia to use a new hypersonic missile, called Oreshnik, for the first time. President Vladimir Putin suggested the missile could be used to target government buildings in Kyiv, though there have been no reports of an Oreshnik being used for a second time. Answering the Ukrainian attack on Rostov on Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it carried out a group strike with 'high-precision, long-range weapons' on the command center of Ukraine's military intelligence agency and another location where it said Ukraine's Neptune missile systems are designed and produced. The attack also targeted Ukrainian ground-based cruise missile systems and U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said. 'The objectives of the strike have been achieved. All objects are hit,' the defense ministry said in a Telegram post. Its claims could not immediately be verified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missiles-target-kyiv-after-ukraine-fires-us-made-missiles-across-the-border/7908204.html	2024-12-20T02:53:35-08:00	
Trump wants to quickly end Gaza war — can he?	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has signaled eagerness to wrap up the war in Gaza as quickly as possible, even as the outgoing Biden administration continues its last-ditch diplomatic push for a ceasefire deal. Earlier this week, Trump said if the hostages held by Hamas are not home by Jan. 20, 2025, the date of his inauguration, then 'all hell is going to break out.' The warning is similar to the threat he issued on social media earlier this month, where he said, 'There will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America.' It's not clear what Trump plans to do in Gaza. When asked to clarify the threat, he said, 'It means it won't be pleasant.' Trump may deploy resources to place military pressure on Hamas, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. However, it's unlikely to be 'significantly harsher than what the Israelis have brought to bear over the last 14 months.' 'There could be another element — which I hope that's not the approach — to maybe squeeze some of that humanitarian aid going in,' Alkhatib told VOA. It's also possible that Trump's threats are directed to Hamas members outside of Gaza and the countries that support them, and Trump might move to pressure those nations to cut off financing, Alkhatib added. Hamas is a U.S.-designated terror organization. Hamas' external wing may be more receptive to Washington's pressure, particularly since its patron, Tehran, has been weakened through the loss of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Like Hamas, Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy, while the Assad regime was Tehran's stalwart ally. Trump's warnings send 'an unmistakable message to the people in the Middle East that the U.S. wants to get this done,' said David Makovsky, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy Project on the Middle East Peace Process. This leaves Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu navigating between placating the ultraright-wing faction of his coalition — which is pushing for building settlements in and even annexing Gaza — and pleasing Trump, who wants credit for ending the war and potentially expanding the Abraham Accords to include Saudi Arabia, Makovsky told VOA. The 2020 agreement brokered under the first Trump administration normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, then later with Morocco. 'Trump is not into building more settlements and staying in Gaza. Trump wants, I think, a Nobel Prize for a breakthrough with Saudi Arabia,' Makovsky said. 'And I don't think those things go together.' Analysts say that even before taking office, Trump is already shaping the calculations of combatants in the Middle East. His pick for national security adviser, Representative Mike Waltz, gave the president-elect credit for last month's ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, brokered by the U.S. and France. 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,' Waltz posted on social media. 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won't be tolerated.' US 'hopeful' for deal Meanwhile, the Biden administration has pledged to spend all the time left in its waning days to try to make a deal happen. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday he is 'hopeful' an agreement can be reached. 'Gaza has to be translated into something different that ensures that Hamas is not in any way in charge, that Israel doesn't have to be, and that there's something coherent that follows that enables the governance, the security, the reconstruction of Gaza,' he said. That goal is still out of reach, despite Washington's renewed diplomatic push with Turkey, Egypt and Qatar. 'I don't see a scenario in which President Biden is going to be able to really fundamentally shift the needle here,' Alkhatib said. He added that while Hamas may be motivated to secure a deal while Biden is still in office rather than after Jan. 20 when the U.S. is likely to drive a much harder bargain, they know that any assurances provided by the Biden administration may not be fulfilled by the Trump administration. This despite officials from both the Biden and Trump administrations saying they are working together in handling global conflicts, partly to secure the transition period that may be seen by adversaries as moments of opportunity, said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. 'And so, the imperative on us, both the outgoing Biden administration, the incoming Trump administration, has to be to lash up more tightly than is typical, to spend more time together than is typical, and to try to ensure we are sending a common, clear message to both friends and adversaries in the Middle East.' The common message from the two leaders is that the U.S. wants the conflict to end. So far, the warring parties are not listening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-to-quickly-end-gaza-war-can-he-/7908063.html	2024-12-20T02:03:41-08:00	
US accuses man of being Chinese agent	LOS ANGELES — China's ruling Communist Party used an agent in California to influence state politics, U.S. prosecutors said Thursday as they unveiled criminal charges against a Chinese national. FBI agents arrested Yaoning 'Mike' Sun, 64, at his home in Chino Hills, near Los Angeles, on charges that he acted as an agent for a foreign government while getting involved in local politics. The complaint claims Sun served as the campaign manager and close confidante for an unnamed politician who was running for local elected office in 2022. During the campaign, he is alleged to have conspired with Chen Jun -- a Chinese national sentenced to prison last month for acting as an illegal agent of Beijing -- regarding his efforts to get the politician elected. The U.S. Department of Justice said Chen discussed with Chinese government officials how they could influence local politicians, particularly on the issue of Taiwan. China considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan part of its territory. Beijing -- which has said it would never rule out using force to bring Taiwan under its control -- has been accused of using local influence campaigns, among other tactics, to sway global opinion on the issue. Charging documents say after the local politician won office in late 2022, Chen instructed Sun to prepare a report on the election to be sent to Chinese government officials, who expressed their thanks for his work. 'The conduct alleged in this complaint is deeply concerning,' said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. 'We cannot permit hostile foreign powers to meddle in the governance of our country.' Sun was charged with one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. He also faces one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. Asked about the charges on Friday, Beijing's foreign ministry said it was 'not aware of the details in the case you mentioned.' But spokesperson Lin Jian said, 'China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.' 'The international community sees clearly who is actually wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,' he said during a regular briefing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-accuses-man-of-being-chinese-agent-/7908166.html	2024-12-20T01:04:05-08:00	
Top US officials in Damascus to meet new Syrian rulers, State Department says	WASHINGTON — Top diplomats from the Biden administration are in Damascus on Friday to meet new Syrian authorities led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a State Department spokesperson said, the first in-person and official meeting between Washington and Syria's de-facto new rulers. The State Department's top Middle East diplomat, Barbara Leaf, Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and newly appointed Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein, who is now tasked with leading the Department's Syria engagement, are the first U.S. diplomats to travel to Damascus since Syria's opposition militias overthrew oppressive President Bashar al-Assad. The visit comes as Western governments are gradually opening channels to HTS and its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and start debating whether or not to remove the terrorist designation on the group. The U.S. delegation's travel follows contacts with France and Britain in recent days. In their meetings, the U.S. officials will discuss with HTS representatives a set of principles such as inclusivity and respect for the rights of minorities that Washington wants included in Syria's political transition, the spokesperson said. The delegation will also work to obtain new information about U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, and other American citizens who went missing during the Assad regime. 'They will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,' the department spokesperson said. 'They also plan to meet with representatives of HTS to discuss transition principles endorsed by the United States and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan,' the spokesperson said. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Syria and shut down its embassy in Damascus in 2012. In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family's decadeslong rule. The lightning offensive raised questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition. Forces under the command of al-Sharaa - better known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani - replaced the Assad family rule with a three-month transitional government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria's northwestern province of Idlib. Washington in 2013 designated al-Sharaa a terrorist, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. It said the Nusra Front, the predecessor of HTS, carried out suicide attacks that killed civilians and espoused a violent sectarian vision. U.S. President Joe Biden and his top aides described the overthrow of Assad as a historic opportunity for the Syrian people who have for decades lived under his oppressive rule, but also warned the country faced a period of risk and uncertainty. Washington remains concerned that extremist group ISIS could seize the moment to resurrect and also wants to avoid any clashes in the country's northeast between Turkey-backed rebel factions and U.S.-allied Kurdish militia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-officials-in-damascus-to-meet-new-syrian-rulers-state-department-says/7908135.html	2024-12-19T23:12:46-08:00	
China's Xi swears in new leader of casino hub Macao	MACAO — Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the casino hub of Macao to diversify its economy as he swore in the former Portuguese colony's new government on Friday at an event marking the 25th anniversary of its handover to China. New Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai — Macao's first leader born in mainland China — vowed to address the territory's unbalanced and uncoordinated economic development. Since its 1999 handover, the city of 687,000 has transformed from a monopoly-driven gambling enclave into the world's largest gaming hub, drawing hordes of tourists from mainland China. The casino boom has improved living standards, but authorities are concerned that the semi-autonomous city's economy is unhealthily dependent on the industry. Some young people say the tourism-dominated economy has limited their career options and the city's diversified development. Critics say years of easy money from tourists have discouraged local businesses from innovating and improving, with many residents relying on personal connections to solve problems rather than civic participation. During a gala dinner on Thursday, Xi praised Macao's progress on economic diversification over the last five years and its strengthened international influence. He called for the city to expand its international role while attracting global talent to build a better Macao. On Friday, he said the city should enhance its industrial development planning, strengthen policy support and boost investment to nurture internationally competitive new industries, in what observers said were stronger and more specific comments than before. 'The special administrative region's government and all sectors of society have to show more care to young people and create a better environment and conditions for their growth, talent development and fulfilling their aspirations,' he said. Sam has promised to accelerate plans to boost tourism and other sectors such as Chinese medicine, finance, tech, exhibitions and commerce. Although political activism has never seriously challenged to Beijing in Macao, authorities have tightened control in recent years, particularly after Hong Kong was rocked by months of huge anti-government protests in 2019. Vocal political dissent has largely been silenced. A vigil commemorating China's military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989 was banned, and pro-democracy figures were barred from competing in legislative elections. Last year, the city toughened its national security law. Xi said 'national sovereignty, security and development interests are above all,' while noting the need to safeguard the city's autonomy. He said security is a precondition for development and residents should cherish their hard-won stability and peace. Like neighboring Hong Kong, Macao is governed separately from the rest of China under a system that allows it to maintain elements of Western-style economic and social systems. It is the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal. With Beijing's policy agenda now dominating Macao's development, the casino hub is deepening economic links and social integration with neighboring Guangdong province. China has designated a special zone on Hengqin Island in neighboring Zhuhai city, jointly run by Guangdong and Macao, to help foster new industries. That zone is planned to have about 120,000 Macao residents by 2035. Xi said that Macao must participate proactively in the Greater Bay Area initiative, which Beijing aims to link Macao, Hong Kong and nine other Guangdong cities into an economic powerhouse. Xi is due to conclude his three-day trip to Macao on Friday. During his stay, he visited a university, the special zone on Hengqin Island and met with Macao's former city leaders and Hong Kong's chief executive, among others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-swears-in-new-leader-of-casino-hub-macao/7908131.html	2024-12-19T22:50:54-08:00

Australia announces $118 million deal to enhance policing in Solomon Islands	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Australia announced on Friday it will pay for more police in Solomon Islands and create a police training center in the South Pacific island nation's capital, Honiara, where Chinese law enforcement instructors are already based under a bilateral security pact with Beijing. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would spend 190 million Australian dollars ($118 million) over four years on funding and training new Royal Solomon Islands Police Force recruits with a package that would 'reduce any need for outside support.' 'My government is proud to make a significant investment in the police force of the Solomon Islands to ensure that they can continue to take primary responsibility for security in the Solomons,' Albanese told reporters in Australia's capital, Canberra. Albanese and his Solomons counterpart, Jeremiah Manele, said in a joint statement on Friday the package would build an enduring security capability in the Solomons, 'thereby reducing its reliance on external partners over time.' Australia has been energetically pursuing new bilateral security deals with its Pacific island neighbors since Beijing and the Solomons signed a security deal in 2022 under Manele's predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare. That deal has created fears among U.S. allies including Australia that the Chinese navy will be allowed to build a base in the strategically important Solomons. Albanese's Labor Party, which was the opposition at the time the pact was signed, described it as Australia's worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II. Australia has recently signed security deals with Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Nauru that effectively give Canberra veto powers over any security deals those countries might want to strike with third nations, including China. Asked if the new deal would require the Chinese security presence to be removed from the Solomons, Albanese did not directly answer. 'The Solomon Islands of course is a sovereign nation. They have some measures in place and we expect that to continue,' Albanese said. 'As a result of this agreement, what we've done is make sure that Australia remains the security partner of choice,' he added. Mihai Sora, a Pacific islands expert at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based international policy think tank, said the agreement was a 'clear win for Solomon Islands, which has gained a much-needed boost to its law and justice sector.' 'But Solomon Islands has not committed to scaling back the essentially permanent rotating presence of around 14 Chinese police trainers in the country, who have been running their own parallel training program with Solomon Islands police since 2022,' Sora said in an email. 'So, the agreement falls short of a solid strategic commitment to Australia from Solomon Islands, and there's no indication that it would derail China-Solomon Islands security ties,' Sora added. Blake Johnson, an analyst at the Australian Security Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank, said Chinese policing in the Pacific gives Beijing tools to control Chinese expatriates and pursue other goals. 'They can be very heavy-handed in their response sometimes. There are also concerns around data and privacy risks associated with Chinese police in the region,' Johnson said. 'Sometimes they're providing surveillance equipment. There are concerns about what that is being used for and what it's capturing,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-announces-118-million-deal-to-enhance-policing-in-solomon-islands-/7908092.html	2024-12-19T19:59:03-08:00

China counting on cyber-psychological cocktail to expand dominance	washington — China's push to develop the world's premier fighting force extends beyond conventional and nuclear capabilities, with U.S. officials warning that Beijing is pouring resources into a mix of psychological warfare and cyber operations. The goal in employing what are known in Beijing as cognitive domain operations, or CDO, is to influence the way China's adversaries think and behave, targeting everyone from the average citizen to senior officials. China 'views controlling the information spectrum in the modern battlespace as a critical enabler of information dominance early in a conflict,' according to the Pentagon's China Military Power report, released Wednesday. 'The PLA [People's Liberation Army] probably intends to use CDO as an asymmetric capability to deter U.S. or third-party entry into a future conflict or as an offensive capability to shape perceptions or polarize a society,' it said, adding that for Chinese military officers, 'subduing the enemy without fighting is the highest realm of warfare.' The Pentagon's report does not state how much money Beijing has allocated for these efforts but says that the PLA has spent parts of the past six years looking at how to incorporate cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to produce deepfakes and other material to mislead the U.S. public. It also says China has tasked some of its leading technology companies, including Baidu, Alibaba and Huawei, with using generative AI to produce better audio and video, in addition to more convincing text and images. Successes and failures The results, however, have been uneven. U.S. intelligence officials repeatedly called out China, along with Russia and Iran, for trying to deploy AI-boosted influence operations in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. Some of the efforts, though, were described as clumsy. 'The quality is not as believable as you might expect,' said a U.S. intelligence official at the time. Earlier efforts, identified by tech giant Microsoft, described an improvement in Beijing's ability to produce 'eye-catching content,' though questions remained about the content's reach and impact. U.S. intelligence officials have also said that Beijing's influence efforts have been hampered by what they describe as a struggle by Chinese intelligence to understand the American psyche with the same sophistication as other U.S. adversaries, such as Russia. China has repeatedly denied such allegations, accusing the U.S. of calling out others for its own wrongdoing. 'For quite some time, the U.S. side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email earlier this month regarding allegations that a Chinese-linked group known as Salt Typhoon had breached U.S. telecommunications companies. 'The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cybersecurity to smear and slander China,' he added. Still, U.S. officials warn that aspects of China's psychological and cyber operations have met with an alarming amount of success, most notably the exploits of the hacking group known as Volt Typhoon. Volt Typhoon has been 'working to embed, burrow into our most sensitive critical infrastructure, not for espionage, but rather for disruption or destruction in the event of a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait,' said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'Induce societal panic' 'This is a world where a war in Asia could see very real impacts … across our nation, with attacks against pipelines, against water facilities, against transportation nodes, against communications, all to induce societal panic and to deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will,' Easterly added, speaking at a virtual cyber conference earlier this month. The CISA director said U.S. cyber teams have worked with companies in the private sector to evict Volt Typhoon from their systems, but there still is a long way to go. 'We think what we've seen to date is really just the tip of the iceberg,' Easterly said. Pentagon officials echo those concerns. 'I think we're starting to see more emphasis in the cognitive space … not being only focused on our leaders but indeed on populations in a way that can be both corrosive to institutions we have but also is really, really hard to, frankly, prevent, deter,' said Christopher Maier, the assistant defense secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict. China and other adversaries such as Russia are 'going to be a lot more aggressive. They're going to take a lot more risk,' Maier said in response to a question from VOA during an event in Washington on Wednesday. 'They're going to try to message our population in ways that, frankly, we would find completely inappropriate and threatening,' he said. But Maier questioned whether such tactics will ultimately yield the desired results. 'The information tool is most useful when it's paired with physical actions and done in a more, if you will, tactical way. That's something that China and Russia could do,' he said. 'But those effects don't tend to last for long.' And, he said, now that the U.S. is on the lookout, China and others could have a harder time finding more success. 'I think they'll see opportunities to exploit what they'll perceive as vulnerabilities,' Maier said, adding, 'I'm not sure they're as vulnerable as they might think.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-counting-on-cyber-psychological-cocktail-to-expand-dominance-/7908073.html	2024-12-19T19:10:51-08:00

Earthquake-hit Vanuatu braces for possible cyclone	On Thursday, two days after Port Vila, the capital city of Vanuatu, was hit by a deadly 7.3 magnitude earthquake with numerous aftershocks, residents were told to prepare for heavy rains that could grow into a cyclone that would bring more destruction to the ravaged island. Earthquakes are commonplace in the Pacific Island archipelago, but Tuesday's temblor was exceptional. Its shaking flattened buildings, destroyed reservoirs, damaged hospitals and roads, and cut off power and telecommunications systems. While most of the damage from the earthquake was in Port Vila, on the island of Efate, there was some damage, including landslides, in the 82 outlying islands. The earthquake was about 30 kilometers west of the capital, at a depth of 57 kilometers. At least 16 people have died, according to officials, but the death toll is expected to climb as emergency response teams search through the rubble for survivors and the dead. About 200 people have been treated for injuries, according to the government's disaster management office. Australia and France have dispatched first-response teams to help with the search. The Associated Press reported that there were 'dramatic rescues of dust-covered survivors that lifted spirits on Tuesday and Wednesday,' but the prospects of similar events grow dimmer as days tick by. According to the National Disaster Management Office, two reservoirs that supply water to the capital crumbled during the earthquake, forcing residents to stand in long lines at stores to purchase the necessity. 'People are not really concerned about electricity. They're just concerned about water,' a Port Vila resident told AP. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Thursday that about 80,000 people were directly affected by the earthquake, and close to 1,000 had been displaced from their homes. The international alliance has slated $1 million for Vanuatu's immediate response efforts, including water, shelter and food. 'Make sure your family is safe,' Vanuatu President Nikenike Vurobaravu said in an address on the country's national broadcaster's Facebook page. 'Help each other during this hard time for the nation.' Tourists who flock to Vanuatu for its lovely beaches found themselves scrambling to secure seats on military evacuation flights that several countries organized. Australia and New Zealand have delivered aid to the island and have been able to evacuate their citizens from the island on the aircraft that delivered the aid. U.S. Ambassador Ann Marie Yastishock brought aid to Vanuatu, including Starlink equipment, Reuters reported. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-hit-vanuatu-braces-for-possible-cyclone/7908050.html	2024-12-19T18:10:28-08:00	
Surveys show widespread Great Barrier Reef coral loss	sydney — Australian scientists said Wednesday that they had found a widespread decrease in coral cover in southern parts of the Great Barrier Reef. Researchers have just completed a routine annual underwater survey of reefs off central Queensland state a month after their analysis showed similar devastation in a northern section. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, a government research agency, said most of the damage it found in northern and southern sections of the Great Barrier Reef during the survey was the result of coral-bleaching warmer ocean temperatures. The Great Barrier Reef off northeastern Australia is the world’s largest coral system. It is roughly the size of Italy or Japan. Along with climate, tropical storms and infestations of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish are also blamed for the coral loss. Mike Emslie, who runs the institute’s Long Term Monitoring Program, told VOA that 'more than a third of the coral around Cooktown-Lizard reefs have been lost since last summer and, similarly, on the southern Great Barrier Reef, we have recorded a 40% decline in coral cover, which is one of the measures we use to indicate reef health of the Capricorn-Bunker group.' The institute’s Long Term Monitoring Program has been running for four decades and examines key indicators of coral health. Researchers survey about 70 so-called core reefs off northeastern Australia each year. Campaigners say the latest underwater survey results have shown 'unprecedented coral losses.' The Australian Marine Conservation Society, a charity, said in a statement Wednesday that the Great Barrier Reef faces 'another summer from hell with heat already building up in the water and coral bleaching warnings for much of the northern reef.' Society Great Barrier Reef campaigner Simon Miller told VOA that it’s part of a global pattern affecting reefs around the world. 'This most recent mass bleaching event was also part of a global mass bleaching event - the Caribbean, in particular, and coral reefs around Florida were extremely badly affected by marine heat waves and by a mass bleaching event that led to really high levels of mortality earlier this year,' Miller said. Warmer seas cause bleaching, forcing the coral to expel the microscopic symbiotic algae that give it most of its energy and color. Reefs can recover from bleaching, but it can take years. If water temperatures do not return to normal, the coral can die.	https://www.voanews.com/a/surveys-show-widespread-great-barrier-reef-coral-loss-/7908041.html	2024-12-19T17:51:35-08:00	
Anger and soul-searching follow sentences in French rape trial	PARIS — Feminists and other critics say the sentences handed down in France’s mass rape trial are too lenient with some calling them shameful. The trial has shocked the nation of France and made international headlines. Speaking to reporters in the southern French city of Avignon, 72-year-old plaintiff Gisele Pelicot said she respected the verdict. She said she never regretted going public — which she said aimed to give other victims of sexual assault the courage to speak out. Pelicot’s ex-husband, Dominique, received the toughest sentence — the maximum of 20 years in prison – for drugging his wife and allowing dozens of men to rape her as she slept. The attacks went on for nearly a decade until police detained him for another sexual incident and discovered scores of videos of the rapes. Some 50 other defendants received sentences ranging from three to 15 years — many less than what prosecutors had recommended. Some walked out free after receiving suspended sentences. It’s not immediately clear whether Dominique Pelicot or others will appeal their sentences. Protesters outside the court in Avignon slammed the sentences as shameful and insufficient. So did women’s rights activists like Laura Slimani, of the Women’s Foundation. On France Info radio, she criticized the French justice system for what she said was its inability to handle sexual violence cases. The Pelicot trial has sparked soul searching — and protests — in France about rape and other forms of gender-based violence. Pelicot herself has become something of a heroine for her courage and dignity. She said France’s so-called macho, patriarchal society must change how it looks at rape. After the verdicts, many again saluted her courage — including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'The shame must change sides,’' Sholz said on X. 'Thank you, Gisele Pelicot.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-and-soul-searching-follow-sentences-in-french-rape-trial/7908033.html	2024-12-19T17:43:14-08:00	
US slow to react to pervasive Chinese hacking, experts say	As new potential threats from Chinese hackers were identified this week, the federal government issued one of its strongest warnings to date about the need for Americans — and in particular government officials and other 'highly targeted' individuals — to secure their communications against eavesdropping and interception. The warning came as news was breaking about a Commerce Department investigation into the possibility that computer network routers manufactured by the Chinese firm TP-Link may pose a threat to the millions of U.S. businesses, households and government agencies that use them. Also on Wednesday, Congress took long-awaited steps toward funding a program that will purge other Chinese technology from U.S. telecommunications systems. The so-called rip-and-replace program targets gear manufactured by Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE. Too far behind While experts said the recent actions are a step in the right direction, they warned that U.S. policymakers have been extremely slow to react to a mountain of evidence that Chinese hackers have long been targeting essential communications and infrastructure systems in the U.S. The lack of action has persisted despite law enforcement and intelligence agencies repeatedly sounding alarms. In January, while testifying before the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, 'There has been far too little public focus on the fact that [People's Republic of China] hackers are targeting our critical infrastructure — our water treatment plants, our electrical grid, our oil and natural gas pipelines, our transportation systems. And the risk that poses to every American requires our attention now.' A year previously, Wray had warned lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee that his investigators were badly outnumbered. 'To give you a sense of what we're up against, if each one of the FBI's cyber agents and intel analysts focused exclusively on the China threat, Chinese hackers would still outnumber FBI Cyber personnel by at least 50-to-1,' Wray said. Decades of complexity Part of the problem, experts said, is that it is difficult for policymakers to summon the political will to make changes that could be disruptive to the lives and livelihoods of U.S. citizens in the absence of public concern about the problem. 'It still remains very, very difficult to impress upon average, typical everyday citizens the gravity of Chinese espionage, or the extent of it,' said Bill Drexel, a fellow with the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. He contrasted the relatively muted public response to the recent revelation of a Chinese hacking operation known as Salt Typhoon, which compromised mobile telephone networks throughout the country, with the uproar that accompanied the far less serious appearance of a Chinese spy balloon over the U.S. mainland in 2023. 'That just goes to show this … problem where really grave issues that are intangible — that are just in cyberspace — are really hard to wrap our minds around,' Drexel told VOA. 'For four decades, we intertwined our supply chains very deeply with China, and our digital systems became more and more complex, allowing more and more compounding ways to be hacked, to be compromised,' Drexel said. 'We've just started to try to change course on this stuff,' he added. 'But there's so much momentum for so long on these issues, and they continue to compound in complexity, such that it's just really hard to catch up.' Warning 'highly targeted' Americans The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued guidance on Wednesday, reporting that it 'has identified cyber espionage activity by People's Republic of China (PRC) government-affiliated threat actors targeting commercial telecommunications infrastructure.' It continued, 'This activity enabled the theft of customer call records and the compromise of private communications for a limited number of highly targeted individuals.' The warning appeared to be related to the Salt Typhoon hack that, according to government investigators, compromised all the major mobile phone carriers in the U.S., giving the Chinese government extraordinary access to the communications among millions of Americans. The five-page CISA document outlines steps that the agency advises all Americans, but particularly those most likely to be targeted, to take immediately. The first is to immediately curtail use of standard mobile communications platforms, such as voice calls and Short Message Service (SMS) texting. Instead, the agency advises Americans to restrict their communications to free messaging platforms that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, which support one-on-one and group chats, as well as voice and video calls. Data sent with end-to-end encryption is extremely difficult to decrypt, even if a malicious actor is able to intercept it during transmission. Among the other advice CISA offered was to avoid using SMS messages for multifactor authentication by switching to apps that provide authenticator codes or, where possible, adopting hardware-based security keys for highly sensitive accounts. Other recommendations included the use of complex and random passwords stored in password manager software, as well as platform-specific suggestions for iPhone and Android users. TP-Link concerns On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported, and other outlets subsequently confirmed, that the Commerce Department, as well as the Justice and Defense departments, are investigating reports that computer routers manufactured by the Shenzhen-based TP-Link are one vector of attack for Chinese hackers. TP-Link currently dominates the market for computer routers in the U.S., with nearly two-thirds of total market share. In October, a report from Microsoft revealed that one Chinese hacking operation it identified as CovertNetwork-1658 has compromised thousands of TP-Link routers to create a network that is used by 'multiple Chinese threat actors' to gain illicit access to computer networks around the world. The Journal's reporting also revealed that the Commerce Department is considering a ban on the sale of TP-Link routers in the U.S. next year, an action that could significantly disrupt the U.S. market for networking hardware. Rip and replace Congress on Wednesday took long-delayed action to address a different potential threat from China, allocating $3 billion to a program that will remove telecommunications equipment manufactured by Huawei and ZTE from rural telecommunications networks in the U.S. Funding for the rip-and-replace program arrives years after the U.S. identified the two companies as posing a potential threat. Beginning in the first Trump administration and continuing during Joe Biden's time in office, the U.S. pressured allies around the world to block the installation of Huawei and ZTE 5G cellular communications equipment from their networks, in some cases threatening to stop sharing sensitive intelligence with allies that failed to comply.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slow-to-react-to-pervasive-chinese-hacking-experts-say/7908035.html	2024-12-19T17:37:36-08:00	
Mogadishu development project brings hope to Somalia	washington — In a landmark event for Somalia, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on Thursday officially launched the 'New Mogadishu' development initiative, a transformative project that aims to reshape the capital's economic landscape. The initiative includes construction of a modern airport, a port and a key economic zone, all focused on fostering growth and attracting investment. During the launch, Mohamud said the initiative showcases the resilience of the Somali business community. 'Somali businessmen have stepped up to provide essential services during challenging times, proving their commitment to the nation's progress,' he said. Mohamud also noted the initiative has the potential for massive job creation. 'The creation of this project is not just about infrastructure; it's about creating opportunities for our youth and uplifting our communities,' he said. 'The launch of the New Mogadishu project marks a significant milestone for Somalia as it seeks to revitalize its capital and strengthen investor confidence, paving the way for a brighter economic future,' Mohamud added. Fardowsa Osman Egal, Somalia's minister of transport and aviation, emphasized the significance of the new airport in this project. 'It is a long dream that is materializing now. Due to the capacity and function of the current Mogadishu airport, which only has one runway, this new international airport will help us increase international flights,' she said. 'The planned state-of-the-art airport and modern port will serve as vital infrastructure, creating a financial zone that is expected to draw both international and local investors.' Valued at approximately $650 million, the New Mogadishu initiative is expected to significantly boost Somalia's economic development. On behalf of Somali business community, Mohamud Abdikarim Gabeyre, the chairman of the Somali Chamber of Commerce and Industry, welcomed the initiative. 'New Mogadishu, on the northern outskirts of the capital, is a project we welcome because we heard that the Somali business community will get the priority of the investment, and we hope it will be successful,' he said. On Wednesday, the president also inaugurated a $400 million groundbreaking development project named Gateway Complex, poised to transform Somalia's capital by introducing Somalia's first five-star hotel, managed by the globally recognized Rotana hospitality group, and an international convention center capable of hosting up to 5,000 attendees. Plans also feature premium hotel apartments, a 300-bed modern hospital, a leading school, a vibrant shopping complex, residential units and recreational facilities. Mogadishu has long suffered from lawlessness and terrorist attacks. Although the capabilities of the al-Shabab terrorist group have been weakened, it continues to pose a threat by assassinating civilians, particularly those who install security cameras on their shops and business centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mogadishu-development-project-brings-hope-to-somalia-/7907986.html	2024-12-19T17:15:33-08:00	
US Republicans plan vote on deal to avert shutdown, lift debt limit	Republicans in the U.S. Congress teed up a vote on Thursday for a new spending package that would avert a looming government shutdown, this time with the support of President-elect Donald Trump, who scuttled a prior bipartisan version. It was not clear whether the measure would survive an evening vote in the House of Representatives. House Democrats emerged from a closed-door meeting to say they would vote against the bill, which their leader, Hakeem Jeffries, called laughable. Republicans control the chamber by a 219-211 majority, meaning they can lose no more than three votes if Democrats unite against the bill. One Republican, Representative Rich McCormick, predicted at least 10 from his party would vote against it. Democrats also currently control the Senate, and Democratic President Joe Biden's support would be needed to sign the package into law and avert a shutdown starting on Saturday. If lawmakers fail to meet that deadline, the U.S. government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to law enforcement in the days leading up to Christmas and cut off paychecks for more than 2 million federal workers. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration warned that travelers could face long lines at airports. Trump urged lawmakers to vote for the package. The incoming president has demanded that lawmakers tie up loose ends before he takes office on January 20. 'Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly,' Trump said in a statement. The new package would fund government operations for three months, until Trump is in the White House and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, according to sources familiar with the package. It also would provide $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in farm aid and extend farm and food aid programs that were due to expire at the end of the year. It does not include other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers. The package would also suspend the debt ceiling until January 2027, which could clear the way for trillions of dollars to be added to the $36 trillion federal debt. Trump's embrace of the deal marks a softening of his earlier demand that Congress eliminate the debt ceiling entirely before he returns to office. Previous fights over the debt ceiling have spooked financial markets, as a U.S. government default would send credit shocks around the world. The limit has been suspended under an agreement that technically expires on January 1, though lawmakers likely will not have to tackle the issue until the spring. Democrats said Trump and his Republicans were trying to remove a barrier to budget-busting tax cuts. 'That's to give them room for tax cuts for the wealthiest in America,' Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer told reporters. When he returns to office, Trump aims to enact tax cuts that could reduce revenues by $8 trillion over 10 years, which would drive the debt higher without offsetting spending cuts. He has vowed not to reduce retirement and health benefits for seniors that make up a vast chunk of the budget and are projected to grow dramatically in the years to come. Several Republicans earlier said they were not interested in getting rid of the debt ceiling if they did not also cut spending. 'It's like limiting, you know, increasing your credit card limit, while you don't do anything to actually constrain spending,' Representative Chip Roy told reporters. The last government shutdown took place in December 2018 and January 2019 during Trump's first White House term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-republicans-plan-vote-on-deal-to-avert-shutdown-lift-debt-limit-/7907977.html	2024-12-19T16:14:08-08:00	
After a police stop in Serbia, journalist finds spyware on phone	Washington / belgrade, serbia — An encounter with police in the Serbian city of Pirot earlier this year unnerved investigative reporter Slavisa Milanov. A journalist for the independent media outlet FAR, Milanov was driving with a colleague in February when they were pulled over by police, who asked the pair to accompany them to a station to be tested for illegal substances. Once there, Milanov said he was asked to leave his phone and personal belongings behind during a check. The drug tests were negative, but when police handed Milanov his phone, he noticed the settings had been changed. Suspecting that spyware may have been installed, he reached out to Amnesty International. In a report published this week, the international watchdog confirmed Milanov’s suspicions, finding forensic evidence that spyware was installed on the phones of several journalists and activists, including Milanov. In at least two cases, software provided by Cellebrite DI — an Israeli company that markets products for government and law enforcement agencies — was used to unlock the phones prior to infection, the report found. Then, Serbian spyware called NoviSpy took covert screenshots, copied contacts and uploaded them to a government-controlled server. 'In multiple cases, activists and a journalist reported signs of suspicious activity on their mobile phones directly following interviews with Serbian police and security authorities,' Amnesty said. 'Major consequences' seen Aleksa Tesic, who has reported on spyware in Serbia for the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, said the Amnesty report precisely documented for the first time cases showing technology abuse for the purpose of affecting civil liberties. 'We had various indications that this was happening before, because Serbia has been interested in advanced spy software for more than 10 years. But this could now have major consequences for democracy in Serbia,' Tesic said. Serbia’s Security Intelligence Agency (BIA) rejected the findings. In a statement on its website, the agency said the report contained 'nonsensical statements,' and that the BIA operates within local law. The Serbian Interior Ministry also denounced the report as incorrect. Milanov said the existence of spyware on his phone could 'jeopardize me, my family, colleagues and my sources.' 'If anything happens to any of us, I will hold the state responsible for it. I don't see who else it could be,' he told VOA Serbian. Milanov is based in Dimitrovgrad, at the border of Serbia and Bulgaria, 330 kilometers from Serbia’s capital, Belgrade. He recalled to VOA the traffic stop and police headquarters, where he believes his phone was accessed. 'There, I was told to turn off my phone and leave other personal belongings during the check. Alcohol and drug tests were, of course, negative. Yet the policeman was, as it seemed to me, messaging with someone unknown to me,' Milanov said. The reporter asked if he was free to go but was told, 'We are waiting for the boss.' Not long afterward, two men arrived. Milanov said they did not identify themselves. 'I assumed they were police inspectors. We went to another police station, where they questioned me about my work, financing, if I have traveled to Bulgaria recently and with whom,' he said. Milanov answered the questions before being released with his belongings. But changes to his phone settings led to a suspicion that something was wrong. At home, he used specialized software and found that although he had left his phone off at the police station, it had been switched back on for the duration of his police encounter. Call for accountability Pavol Szalai, who heads the European Union-Balkans Desk of Reporters Without Borders, told VOA that Amnesty’s report corroborates information his organization had about journalists targeted by surveillance. 'Spyware and surveillance used in an illegitimate way kills journalism without spilling [any] blood of a journalist. Surveillance undermines confidentiality of sources, which is a cornerstone of press freedom,' he said. 'And as for Serbia on the international level, it must be held accountable by the international organizations of which it is a member.' Serbia is a European Union candidate country. But a report this year by the European Commission said the country lacked progress, including in the rule of law, the fight against corruption, nonalignment with Russia sanctioning and media freedoms. A European Commission spokesperson told VOA that any attempts to illegally access citizens’ data, including journalists and political opponents, if confirmed, are not acceptable. 'The commission expects national authorities to thoroughly examine any such allegations and to restore citizens’ trust,' the spokesperson said. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that while he could not comment on a specific case, the use of spyware raises concerns. 'Speaking broadly, we have made quite clear since the outset of this administration the concerns that we have about governments that use spyware to track journalists, to track dissident groups, to track others who legitimately oppose or report on government activities,' Miller said in response to a question by VOA. Grant Baker, a research analyst for technology and democracy at Freedom House, said Serbia should conduct an impartial investigation and provide remedy to those affected. 'Authorities should also amend excessively broad laws regulating surveillance so they better align with both the European Court of Human Rights rulings and the International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance,' Baker said. The international community should also 'make clear that such disproportionate surveillance is a grave threat to democracy,' Baker said. 'While export controls are not a panacea, they are one important and necessary step to reducing the technology’s negative impact on human rights around the world,' he said. Serbia has a vibrant media landscape, but reporters often face political pressure, and impunity for crimes against journalists tends to be the norm, according to press freedom groups. Reporters Without Borders ranks Serbia 98th out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 reflects the best environment for media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-a-police-stop-in-serbia-journalist-finds-spyware-on-phone-/7907624.html	2024-12-19T16:05:10-08:00	
Somalia 'open' to Ethiopian troop role	The Somali government is 'open' to a potential role for Ethiopian troops in an African Union mission scheduled to take over peacekeeping operations in the country next month. A senior Somali government official on Thursday told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that the Somali government has 'secured' and 'allocated' all troops needed from the four other AU-troop-contributing countries — Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda — to participate in the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia, or AUSSOM. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he had not been cleared to speak with reporters. But Somali leaders, he added, are now 'ready to reconsider' Ethiopian involvement in AUSSOM following a conciliatory dialogue between the countries hosted by Turkey last week. In recent months, Mogadishu had repeatedly demanded that Addis Ababa withdraw its troops from Somali territory unless Ethiopia canceled a controversial Memorandum of Understanding with Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland. The memorandum grants Ethiopia access to a 20-kilometer stretch of Red Sea coastline in return for potential recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The anonymous official said although Somalia secured all troops from those four AU nations to compensate for the absence of Ethiopian troops, the recent diplomatic breakthrough has reopened the door for involving Ethiopia’s military support. During the talks in Ankara, Ethiopia and Somalia agreed to respect each other’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The possible breakthrough came just weeks after a spokesperson for Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiat Getachew, told media outlets that Ethiopia’s focus was on al-Shabab. 'Ethiopia's key role, in any situation — in bringing al-Shabab to a level where it cannot be a threat to the region, as well as its role in the establishment and stability of the Somali government — is known both by the Somalis and the international community,' he said. 'It is an undeniable fact that the Ethiopian army has made sacrifices in blood and bones for this great result,' Nebiat added. 'The work of weakening the [Somalia-based] al-Shabab terrorist group will continue under any circumstances so that it does not pose a threat to our national security and the victories achieved through the sacrifices made so far are not reversed.' In a Thursday meeting, the AU’s peace and security council expressed concern about the threat posed by al-Shabab and condemned the group’s attacks on Somali and AU forces. The AU appealed to the U.N. Security Council to explore financing options for AUSSOM. 'This is vital for #AUSSOM to fulfill its mandate & support the #Somalia Security Sector Development Plan (SSDP),' the AU said in a post on the X social media platform. Starting in January, AUSSOM will have 11,900 personnel operating on the ground in Somalia, including soldiers, police and civilian support staff, according to Somali and AU officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-open-to-ethiopian-troop-role/7907731.html	2024-12-19T16:03:06-08:00	
During Brazil's elections, women and minorities in media targeted with hate	WASHINGTON — In a polarized environment during Brazil's municipal elections, journalists — mostly women or minorities — faced a disproportionate number of online and offline attacks. A report compiled by the Coalition in Defense of Journalism, or CDJor, monitored hostility toward journalists between Aug. 15, when the election campaign began, and Oct. 27, the date of the runoff. The findings published in December show most attacks were directed at female journalists, despite women making up a minority of the media workers monitored. The rise in attacks underscores a culture of growing hostility toward both media and minority groups in the country, analysts say. 'We live in a very misogynistic and macho culture, so this is what happens when women are in a public space, getting power and being empowered,' said Cristina Zahar of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, which is a member of the CDJor. Brazil's Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment. The recent elections were for mayors, vice mayors and city councilors in Brazilian municipalities. An overwhelming majority of right or center-right candidates won mayoral races in state capitals this year. The shift is indicative of a rightward trend within the country, Reuters reported, even as the far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, was unseated during the 2022 presidential elections. Alongside harassment of female journalists covering the latest municipal elections, Black journalists experienced widespread racism, according to the CDJor report. The report cited attacks on journalist Pedro Borges, who was the target of racial comments online after interviewing a right-wing political candidate on television. Black journalists in Brazil are often targets of dehumanizing name-calling and appearance-based attacks, Zahar, who lives in Sao Paulo, told VOA. 'It's a way of taking away their identity, taking away their right to be a good professional and exist in the journalism space,' Zahar said. Similarly, attacks directed at female journalists often consisted of comments on physical appearance and name-calling, according to the CDJor report. The attacks on women mostly took place on social media platforms. On Instagram, two out of three attacks were directed at female journalists. On X it was more than half, the report found. Juliana Dal Piva, an investigative journalist for the outlet ICL Noticias, has been on the receiving end of such harassment since Bolsonaro, who analysts say made 'recurrent and vicious attacks on journalists,' was president. Dal Piva said that after she published investigations into Bolsonaro's leadership in 2019, she faced legal persecution and an onslaught of online hatred. She said she has also received threatening messages from Bolsonaro's lawyer. 'The people around Bolsonaro felt they had to destroy me in some way,' Dal Piva told VOA. 'They couldn't point out any mistakes in any of my stories, so instead they attacked me and destroyed me in other ways — my reputation, my career, who I am.' There were other attack incidents in 2021 and 2022, but she said the worst occurred this June. A right-wing influencer published a doctored image of a text conversation implicating her in a plan to arrest Bolsonaro; online hatred and threats quickly followed, she said. Through X and Instagram, Bolsonaro supporters have used misogynistic slurs, made sexualized comments using a double entendre of her surname, and criticized her appearance. She also received death threats and comments telling her to take her own life, she told VOA. 'All of the content is very misogynous. It's very against women,' she said in a September interview with Global Investigative Journalism Network. 'For us as women journalists, you have to be strong, right? You can't cry, you can't be weak, you can't be afraid. This is not an option.' Although Bolsonaro is no longer in power, his leadership created 'an environment of permanent hostility' toward the press, according to Reporters Without Borders. Journalists are still struggling to navigate this environment, Zahar said. 'Since Bolsonaro, a red line has been crossed for the relationship between the presidency and the press,' Zahar told VOA. 'And we, the media, must learn how to deal with this situation.' Zahar and Dal Piva are both worried about the future of free expression in Brazil. 'When you don't have free press, what do you have? A dictatorship,' Zahar said. To remedy the situation, the CDJor report recommends that Brazilian authorities strengthen public policies to protect journalists, hold aggressors accountable and review abusive judicial practices. The report encouraged online platforms to develop more effective mechanisms to curb online attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/during-brazil-s-elections-women-and-minorities-in-media-targeted-with-hate-/7907723.html	2024-12-19T15:53:25-08:00

UN chief tells Israel to stop bombing Syria	U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on Israel to halt its airstrikes on Syria, calling them violations of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 'Syria's sovereignty, territorial unity and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres told reporters. Since the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad abruptly fell earlier this month, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes, including around the capital, Damascus, that it says are aimed at destroying strategic weapons and military infrastructure. The family of Austin Tice, the American journalist detained in Syria for more than 12 years, has raised concerns that Israel may be striking a part of the country where the reporter is held. Israeli troops have also moved into the demilitarized zone between Syria and the Israel-occupied Golan Heights — formed after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war — that U.N. peacekeepers patrol. 'Let me be clear: There should be no military forces in the area of separation other than U.N. peacekeepers — period. Israel and Syria must uphold the terms of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, which remains fully in force,' Guterres said. Israeli officials have said the move is a limited and temporary measure intended to ensure the security of Israel’s borders. However, Israeli officials have not indicated when Israel’s troops will be withdrawn. Guterres also said the U.N. is focusing on helping foster an 'inclusive, credible and peaceful' political transition in Syria and getting aid moving to address one of the most severe humanitarian crises in the world. 'This is a decisive moment — a moment of hope and history, but also one of great uncertainty,' he said. 'But it is the obligation of the international community to stand with the people of Syria who have suffered so much. Syria’s future must be shaped by its people, for its people, with the support of all of us.' Also on Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that it has 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, more than twice the 900 it previously said were there. The Pentagon said the additional troops are considered temporary forces. They were sent to Syria to support the mission against Islamic State militants. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder told reporters he did not know how long the number had been 2,000, but it predated the fall of Assad. 'For many of our deployments, numbers will fluctuate from time to time. But given that this number is significantly higher than what we've been briefing, I wanted to let you know as soon as I found out this information,' Ryder told VOA. He added that he learned of the new figure Thursday. Meanwhile, Iraq on Thursday sent nearly 2,000 Syrian soldiers back to Syria after they had sought refuge in Iraq during the push by rebel forces to oust Assad, according to an Iraqi military statement. The Syrian soldiers were returned at their request and entered via an Iraq-Syria border crossing, according to the statement. The Iraqi Defense Ministry kept the soldiers’ weapons and will return them to a new Syrian government once it is formed, the statement said. Russian response Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday rejected the notion that Assad’s ouster represented a defeat for Russia. Putin said during his annual news conference that Russia had 'achieved our goals' in Syria, where it rushed to provide direct military support for Assad’s government more than nine years ago to help push back rebel fighters. Russian forces operated out of a network of bases in Syria to carry out airstrikes that helped Assad’s military gain an advantage in the civil war. After rebels made a surprise surge that toppled Assad’s government earlier this month, Assad fled to Russia. Putin said Thursday that he had not yet met with Assad but planned to do so. Among the topics Putin said he would discuss is the whereabouts of Tice. He also said he could ask those now in control in Syria about Tice. Syrian transition U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Syrians face an 'incredibly fraught' opportunity as they work to shift away from decades of Assad family rule to a new future. Speaking at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations, Blinken said the question is whether Syrians will 'seize an opportunity for the first time in decades not to be governed by a dictator, not to be governed by an outside power, not to be governed by a terrorist organization, not to be governed by one sect or minority over another.' He also pointed to the rebels who seized power, and the opportunity they have to engage with the outside world and not take actions that will isolate the country. Blinken highlighted the example of the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the group pledged to be more moderate after it seized control but ultimately acted otherwise and ended up 'terribly isolated around the world.' He said those in Syria need to move the country forward in an inclusive, nonsectarian way, to protect minorities and deal with security challenges such as chemical weapons and groups such as Islamic State. Syria’s new education minister, Nazir Mohammad al-Qadri, said Thursday that the new government would not restrict the rights of girls to learn. 'Education is a red line for the Syrian people, more important than food and water,' he told Reuters in Damascus. 'The right to education is not limited to one specific gender,' he said. 'There may be more girls in our schools than boys.'

Biden's immigration legacy is a complex one	WASHINGTON — Immigration has been a defining challenge of the Biden presidency, marked by record numbers of asylum-seekers and other migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Joe Biden pledged to modernize the nation's immigration system and rebuild a refugee resettlement program that had hit historic lows under the previous administration. But despite issuing a record number of immigration-related executive actions — surpassing the Trump administration — Biden's efforts drew criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Critics on the right said the administration was being too lenient, while those on the left said it was too harsh. The Biden administration inherited a fractured immigration system, including a backlog of asylum cases, a reduction in refugee processing capacity, and policies such as Title 42 that significantly shaped migration patterns. During a webinar, Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at Migration Policy Institute (MPI), provided an overview of the Biden administration's record. He noted that Biden's approach to enforcement away from the border has been seen as largely favorable by experts and immigration advocates. He said Biden administration officials focused on enforcement guidelines, rather than trying to deport everyone, yet the crisis at the border cast a long shadow over his legacy. He emphasized the success of legal immigration under Biden, pointing to the high numbers of visas issued, the record number of naturalizations and the resurgence of refugee admissions. About '3.5 million people were naturalized under the Biden administration, the highest of any one-term presidency,' he said. However, Chishti said the administration's handling of border security was less successful. The administration faced overwhelming numbers of migrants, many arriving from countries beyond Mexico and Central America. 'The Biden presidency entered office with a crisis at the border, which was precipitated by the COVID crisis and Title 42,' he said. The administration's failure to call the situation a crisis, he added, contributed to a perception of mishandling, despite efforts to manage it through new programs like the CBP One app and various parole initiatives. Handling the border Marielena Hincapie, a visiting scholar at Cornell Law School who participated in the webinar, praised efforts under the Department of Homeland Security's leadership to increase naturalization rates, expedite work permit processing, and implement innovative policies such as deferred action for undocumented workers who had experienced labor disputes. These measures, she said, benefited not only immigrants but also the broader U.S. workforce and economy. Hincapie also criticized the administration's handling of border issues, calling it mismanagement. She highlighted the role of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in exacerbating the crisis by busing and flying thousands of migrants to New York, Chicago and elsewhere. Hincapie also pointed to additional involvement at the state level, saying, 'There's not only the busing and flying of migrants, which DeSantis did, but also litigation.' 'And I really see this as the Biden's inner circle, his political and communications folks, failed to understand that this was a narrative war and the fact that they refused to call it a crisis when that is what voters were seeing. … They fell silent and decided not to prioritize immigration, and by doing so, they ceded the narrative,' she said. Migration shifts The Biden administration also faced shifts in migration patterns. Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at MPI, said the reality at the U.S.-Mexico border shifted once again during Biden's term with migrants arriving in large numbers from across the Western Hemisphere and from countries around the world. The demographics of migrants also changed, she said, from single adults to families, and many were seeking asylum, further complicating border processing. U.S. law offers asylum to people facing persecution in their home countries on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular group. Though there are two kinds of asylum, affirmative and defensive, not all asylum claims come from migrants arriving at the border. Immigrants may claim affirmative asylum within one year of their latest arrival in the United States or request a defensive asylum while fighting an order of deportation. 'All this resulted in a high number of migrants released into the interior of the U.S.,' Putzel-Kavanaugh said. This brought the border crisis into the interior of the nation, with large numbers of newly arrived migrants heavily concentrated in cities like New York, Chicago and Denver — cities already facing housing shortages. Putzel-Kavanaugh also praised the Biden administration's work to pair increased enforcement with options for safe and orderly legal migration. 'We saw the introduction of programs like CBP One app, which allowed migrants to make appointments at ports of entry along the border, and the parole program for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela,' she said. Despite these efforts, Putzel-Kavanaugh said many saw the measures as 'too little, too late.' But that shift in migrant arrivals from irregular crossings to legally arriving at ports of entry has been one of the few success stories of Biden's border management strategies. Monthly migrant encounters dropped significantly from the highs of December 2022, with a decrease from more than 300,000 encounters to about 106,000 in October 2024, according to CBP figures. Issue for years to come While Biden's efforts to modernize immigration systems and address asylum claims were significant, experts said the ongoing challenges of irregular migration and border security will remain a focal point in U.S. immigration policy for years to come. 'I do think in summary, we do have two real important crises in our country,' Chishti said. 'We do have a labor market crisis across occupations from low, mid to high levels [and a border crisis]. This is why a lot of these people who have come in, even though they came irregularly, have been absorbed.' Chishti pointed to remarks in 2022 from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, about the U.S. labor market and its dynamics. Powell said immigration is a key source of labor supply, and the significant decline in immigration levels during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the labor supply-demand mismatch. That shortfall in immigration resulted in fewer workers available to fill jobs, particularly in sectors that traditionally rely on immigrant labor, such as health care, hospitality and agriculture. Powell acknowledged that addressing the labor supply constraints, including through immigration policy, could help ease pressure to raise wages and reduce inflation without significant harm to employment levels. 'The reason nothing is happening on changes or reform to our legal immigration system — so we can get more people legally for our labor market needs — is because of the crisis of the border,' Chishti said. 'These are twin crises, but they're getting interlinked,' he said. 'Unless we get the border crisis under control, we won't be able to address our labor market crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-s-immigration-legacy-is-a-complex-one/7907567.html	2024-12-19T13:04:27-08:00

US says Pakistan developing missiles that eventually could hit US	WASHINGTON — A senior White House official on Thursday said nuclear-armed Pakistan is developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities that eventually could allow it to strike targets outside of South Asia, including in the United States. In his stunning revelation about the onetime close U.S. partner, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said Islamabad's conduct raised 'real questions' about the aims of its ballistic missile program. 'Candidly, it's hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,' Finer told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace audience. 'Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,' he said. If those trends continue, Finer said, 'Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.' His speech came a day after Washington announced a new round of sanctions related to Pakistan's ballistic missile development program, including on the state-run defense agency that oversees the program.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-pakistan-developing-missiles-that-eventually-could-hit-us/7907518.html	2024-12-19T12:28:19-08:00

US imposes sanctions on Iran, Houthi-related targets	The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday on Iran and Houthi-related entities, according to the Treasury Department website which listed a number of individuals, companies and vessels that had been targeted. The sanctions target three vessels involved in the trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemicals, which generates billions of dollars for Iran's leaders, supporting Tehran's nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and financing of proxies including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, the Treasury said. 'The United States is committed to targeting Iran’s key revenue streams that fund its destabilizing activities,' Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a release. Smith said Iran relies on a 'shadowy network' of vessels, companies, and facilitators for those activities. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The vessels targeted were the Djibouti-flagged crude oil tanker MS Enola, owned by Journey Investment company, the San Marino-flagged MS Angia, and the Panama-flagged MS Melenia. The last two tankers are managed and operated by Liberia- and Greece-registered Rose Shipping Limited. The sanctions block all property and interests in the United States of the designated parties, and U.S. persons and entities dealing with them could be exposed to sanctions or enforcement actions including fines. The Treasury said it also imposed sanctions on 12 individuals to pressure procurement and financing schemes by the Yemen Houthi group. Those included Hashem Ismail Ali Ahmad al-Madani, the head of the Houthi-aligned central bank in Sanaa, for their alleged roles in trafficking arms, laundering money and shipping illicit Iranian oil for the benefit of the Houthis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-iran-houthi-related-targets/7907399.html	2024-12-19T11:22:58-08:00

HRW report: Israel committing genocide by depriving Gaza civilians of water	A new report Thursday from New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch, or HRW, has accused Israel of committing genocide for intentionally depriving civilians in Gaza of an adequate water supply, likely resulting in the deaths of thousands. The 179-page report published on the group’s website outlines how, since the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas began in October 2023, Israeli authorities and forces cut off and later restricted piped water to Gaza, as well as cutting electricity and restricting fuel, rendering most of the enclave’s sanitation infrastructure useless. Additionally, the report said Israel deliberately destroyed and damaged water and sanitation infrastructure and water repair materials; and blocked the entry of critical water supplies. In a statement, HRW Executive Director Tirana Hassan accused Israel of deliberately depriving Palestinians of an element essential for human life for more than a year. 'This isn’t just negligence,' Hassan said. 'It is a calculated policy of deprivation that has led to the deaths of thousands from dehydration and disease that is nothing short of the crime against humanity of extermination, and an act of genocide.' Israel emphatically denied the charges. In a statement, Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories agency, COGAT, called HRW’s charges a 'libelous claim,' and 'an egregious lie.' The COGAT statement said millions of liters of water flow into Gaza through three pipelines, and Israel has 'facilitated hundreds of water infrastructure repairs and fixed water lines leading to Gaza on the Israeli side that were damaged by Hamas.' 'We operate in accordance with international law,' the COGAT statement said. 'Saying otherwise is just flagrant deceit,' the statement said. Earlier Thursday, medics in Gaza reported Israeli airstrikes overnight killed at least 13 people in northern and central parts of the Gaza Strip. The strikes came as mediators worked to try to secure a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that would include the release of hostages still held in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said late Wednesday that he is 'hopeful' an agreement can be reached and pledged to spend all the time left in the waning days of the Biden administration to try to make a deal happen. 'It should happen. It needs to happen. We need to get people home,' Blinken said during an event at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'We need to get the ceasefire. We need to get people moving in a different direction, toward better lives, toward repairing the terrible damage that’s been done.' Blinken said Hamas has been the 'main impediment' to a ceasefire deal, but that he thinks Hamas leaders understand at this point that their supporters such as Hezbollah and Iran are 'not coming to the rescue.' CIA Director William Burns landed in Qatar on Wednesday for meetings with Qatari officials, the latest in what has been months of work by the United States, Qatar and Egypt to try to broker an agreement. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope about achieving a deal as he spoke to reporters Wednesday. 'After many rejections by Hamas, we hope we're going to have some news before the holiday of Hanukkah and Christmas,' Danon said. Still, Danon cautioned that in the past, Hamas has made last-minute demands that had thwarted other possible agreements, while the militants have in turn blamed Israel for the monthslong stalemate in reaching a halt to the warfare. New possible terms of a ceasefire and hostage release seemed in flux. 'We hope it will be in one stage' with the release of all hostages, Danon said, 'because we want to see all the hostages back home.' He added, though, 'Maybe it will not be in one stage. And basically, it will be similar to what we saw in the past more than a year ago — that you have a ceasefire, a long one, and at the same time of the ceasefire, during that ceasefire, hostages will be released. And we are talking mainly on the humanitarian aspect of women and the sick and the older hostages.' Months of talks have proven fruitless in halting the fighting triggered by the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. VOA’s United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

Nicaragua's proposed media reform echoes that of other authoritarian regimes	Nicaragua is expected to rubber stamp a change to its constitution in January that alters presidential power and increases state control over media. If ratified, the change would mandate that the state has power to ensure media outlets and platforms are not 'subject to foreign interests and do not spread false news.' Analysts say it would replicate a move in other authoritarian countries around the world, including Cuba, Venezuela and former Soviet countries. Carlos Jornet, president of the freedom of the press and information committee of the Inter American Association, said that controlling free speech in social media and on the internet was a 'growing phenomenon' in the Americas. 'Worse still, the governments promoting such controls do so after having co-opted the judiciary, the legislature, and all oversight bodies,' he told VOA. 'It is clear that when the government labels information as false, there will be no possibility to exercise a defense or argue about the veracity of a complaint or the relevance of an opinion,' Jornet said. The latest reform, which was passed in November, must be confirmed in a second vote in January. Requested by President Daniel Ortega, the reform seeks to extend his term in office from five to six years and change the role of vice president, who is Ortega’s wife Rosario Murillo, to 'co-president.' The police and military will be strengthened in a way that allows Ortega to tighten his grip on power in the Central American state. Ortega’s attacks on media freedom have already forced hundreds of journalists and others into exile to avoid threat of arrest and imprisonment, say watchdogs. More than 200 political prisoners were freed last year and expelled to the United States, including five former presidential hopefuls jailed after seeking to challenge Ortega in the 2021 election, and the publisher of one of the country’s oldest newspapers. At least 229 people detained in Nicaragua for political reasons suffered torture and 'crimes against humanity,' according to the nongovernmental organization, Nicaragua Never Again Human Rights Collective. The group estimated that around 2,000 people have been arrested in connection with 2018 anti-government protests, Reuters reported this month. Critics of the latest constitutional change say it effectively legalizes the 'absolute power' wielded by Ortega and Murillo. However, Gustavo Porras, the head of the Nicaraguan legislature, has said the reform will be approved next month and described the criticism as a 'stupid way of carrying out opposition.' The Nicaraguan Embassy in Madrid did not respond to VOA’s emailed request for comment. Lucia Pineda Ubau, director of the news site 100% Noticias, said the new constitution will make it easier for authorities to target independent journalism. 'This is serious because it includes it in the constitution policy, which continues to punish, persecute and criminalize journalists and the media,' she told VOA from her home in exile in Costa Rica. 'This adds to the reform of cybercrime [legislation], which was passed in September this year,' she said. The impending constitutional reforms propose increased sentences from 10 to 15 years in prison for propagating false news or misrepresentations that are ruled to have caused alarm, fear or anxiety. It also expands the law’s reach beyond Nicaragua’s borders. 'This government has increased the terror for exiled journalists,' Pineda said. The changes in Nicaragua replicate similar laws and regulations in the region that analysts say are used to silence dissent and media. In Venezuela, attacks on independent media by the government of President Nicolas Maduro over the past 11 years have created a 'kind of news desert,' according to the Committee for Protection of Journalists. A report that the watchdog published earlier this year found that the government did not bother to carry out a fresh crackdown against the media before the July presidential election because of the effectiveness of its sustained campaign of repression. Cuba has also passed a series of laws that further regulate freedom of expression, said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and professor of government at American University in Washington. 'Cuba has similar laws to Nicaragua,' he told VOA, referencing Decree 35, which entails criminal penalties for dissemination of disinformation and requirements for telecommunications providers to suspend or terminate services. 'It also potentially gives authorities enormous latitude to criminalize online commentary [like] ‘inciting mobilizations or other acts that alter public order,’ ‘subverting the constitutional order’ or ‘defamation with an impact on the country’s prestige.’' LeoGrande said that Cuba’s penal code, which came into force in 2022, contains provisions so broadly worded that they can be used to charge people for criticism or non-violent protest. Cuba’s Social Communication Law, which came into force in October, imposes closer regulation on online communication and encourages the repression of dissenting voices. Reporters With Borders said in October that 11 journalists have already been summoned by Cuba’s National Revolutionary Police, charged and forced to resign from their jobs. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said the impending changes to Nicaragua’s constitution mark a further erosion of any checks and balances on executive power. 'If adopted, these changes will sound the death knell for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Nicaragua,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nicaragua-proposed-reform-on-media-echoes-that-of-other-authoritarian-regimes/7907288.html	2024-12-19T10:15:58-08:00	
US ambassador: US arms manufacturers could help boost Vietnam's capabilities	HANOI, VIETNAM — U.S. weapons manufacturers could work with Vietnamese counterparts to help build Vietnam's armed forces, the U.S. ambassador to the southeast Asian country said on Thursday. 'Our goal is to ensure that Vietnam has what it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace,' U.S. Ambassador Marc Knapper said at an international arms expo in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. The expo, held at the Gia Lam airport, brought together 250 exhibitors, including geopolitical rivals such as the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Iran. U.S. exhibitors included Boeing and Textron Aviation. China was present with Norinco and Gaodu International Trade. Iran's defense ministry pavilion wasn't far from booths set up by Israeli companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries. Several Russian firms also attended, along with Ukraine's Motor Sich. Vietnam has been trying to increase its domestic arms manufacturing while reducing its reliance on Russia for weapon imports. In 2022, Russia made up around 60% of all of Vietnam's military purchases, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But Vietnam's longstanding efforts to diversify its imports have been accelerated by the war in Ukraine. It has also been trying to boost its own capacity to make arms and displayed military equipment it made at the expo. A key driver for Vietnam is the escalating tensions in the South China Sea, a key trade and security route. It is a flashpoint in Asia and a fault line in the U.S.-China regional rivalry. Vietnam has been critical of China's increasingly hostile actions in the disputed waters. Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have overlapping claims in the busy sea passage. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hailed the event as a 'message of peace, cooperation and development.' He was later given a tour of a military plane made by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ambassador-us-arms-manufacturers-could-help-boost-vietnam-s-capabilities/7907234.html	2024-12-19T09:07:42-08:00	
France's Macron visits cyclone-devastated Mayotte as residents plead for aid	MAMOUDZOU, MAYOTTE — French President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey Cyclone Chido's destruction and was immediately confronted with a firsthand account of devastation across the French territory. 'Mayotte is demolished,' Assane Haloi, a security agent, told Macron after he stepped off the plane. Macron had been moving along in a line of people greeting him when Haloi grasped his hand and spoke for a minute about the harrowing conditions the islands faced without bare essentials since Saturday when the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory off the coast of Africa. 'We are without water, without electricity, there is nowhere to go because everything is demolished,' she said. 'We can't even shelter, we are all wet with our children covering ourselves with whatever we have so that we can sleep.' Numbers of dead unknown At least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically, French authorities said. But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died. Macron arrived shortly after The Associated Press and other journalists from outside were able to reach Mayotte to provide accounts from survivors of the horror over the weekend when winds howled above 220 kph (136 mph) and peeled the roofs and walls from homes that collapsed around the people sheltering inside. In the shantytown Kaweni on the outskirts of the capital Mamoudzou, a swath of hillside homes was reduced to scraps of corrugated metal, plastic, piles of bedding and clothing, and pieces of timber marking the frame where homes once stood. 'Those of us who are here are still in shock, but God let us live,' Nassirou Hamidouni said as he dug in the rubble of his former home. 'We are sad. We can't sleep because of all of the houses that have been destroyed.' Macron took a helicopter tour of the damage and then met with patients and staff at a hospital, who described having to work around the clock. A woman who works in the psychological unit became emotional as she described staff becoming exhausted and unable to care for patients. 'Help the hospital staff, help the hospital,' pleaded the woman, whose name was not known. 'Everyone from top to bottom is wiped out.' More help on the way Macron, who was wearing a traditional red, black and gold Mayotte scarf over his white dress shirt and tie, put his hand on her shoulder as she wiped away tears. He sought to reassure people that food, medical aid and additional rescuers arrived with him and more help was on its way in the form of water and a field hospital to be set up Friday. A navy ship brought 180 tons of aid and equipment, the French military said. But the visit took a testy turn when Macron was criticized for being out of touch about what was happening on the ground by a man who said they had gone six days in Ouangani without water or a visit from rescue services. The president said it took the military four days to clear the roads and get a plan in place to deliver aid. 'If you want to continue shouting to get airtime,' Macron said as he was cut off, by the man saying he didn't intend to shout. 'If you are interested in my response, if not I will walk away.' Residents have expressed agony at not knowing if loved ones were dead or missing, partly because of the hasty burials required under Muslim practice to lay the dead to rest within 24 hours. 'We're dealing with open-air mass graves,' said Estelle Youssoufa, who represents Mayotte in the French parliament. 'There are no rescuers, no one has come to recover the buried bodies.' Macron acknowledged that many who died haven't been reported. He said phone services will be repaired 'in the coming days' so that people can report their missing loved ones. France's poorest territory Mayotte, with a population of 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants, is France's poorest territory. It is part of an archipelago located between mainland Africa's east coast and northern Madagascar that had been a French colony. Mayotte voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum as the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros. The cyclone devastated entire neighborhoods as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn't be so extreme. Signs of the disaster and its impact were everywhere. Streets remained swamped in puddles. Bright clothing was hung to dry on the wooden frames of homes and along the railings of a footbridge over a debris-strewn stream in the Kaweni slum. Throngs of motorbikes and cars lined up at a gas station still in service. Families sprawled out on blankets at a school where 500 people were taking shelter. Women washed clothing in buckets of water as children played with the pieces of a giant chessboard. Alibouna Haithouna, a displaced mother of four, was with her own mother who had been forced to leave a hospital after her son died there. 'There was a tragedy. We lost my brother. We are here,' Haithouna said. 'My brother's body, we haven't been able to get it from the hospital because there is a lot of paperwork to do and in addition to that you have to pay to recover the body.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-macron-visits-cyclone-devastated-mayotte-as-residents-plead-for-aid/7907162.html	2024-12-19T08:30:05-08:00	
Appeals court removes prosecutor Fani Willis from Georgia election case against Trump, others	ATLANTA, Georgia — A state appeals court on Thursday removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others but did not dismiss the indictment, leaving the future of the prosecution uncertain. The case against Trump and more than a dozen others had already been largely stalled for months while the Georgia Court of Appeals considered the pretrial appeal. The new ruling means it will be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to find another prosecutor to take over the case and to decide whether to continue to pursue it, though that could be delayed if Willis decides to appeal to the state Supreme Court. But whether it is ultimately Willis or another prosecutor in charge, it seems unlikely that a prosecution against Trump could continue while he's president for the next four years. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges. Two federal criminal cases against Trump have already been abandoned after the Republican won the presidency in November. Meanwhile, a judge in New York has refused throw out his hush money conviction from earlier this year, though the future of that case is uncertain. A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump's narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the state. Four of them have since pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. Trump and some of the remaining defendants tried to get Willis and her office removed from the case and to have the case dismissed. They argued that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest and that she made improper public statements about the case. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case. Trump and the others appealed that ruling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-removes-prosecutor-fani-willis-from-georgia-election-case-against-trump-others/7907133.html	2024-12-19T08:06:32-08:00	
Suspect in killing of US insurance CEO will return to New York to face murder charges	HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pennsylvania — The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO will return to New York to face murder charges after agreeing to be extradited Thursday during a court appearance in Pennsylvania where he was arrested last week after five days on the run. Luigi Mangione waived a preliminary hearing on the Pennsylvania charges in exchange for the prosecutor giving him a 20-page investigative report from the Altoona Police Department. Mangione also waived extradition to New York. Blair County Judge David Consiglio ordered that Mangione be turned over to the New York Police Department. At least a dozen uniformed NYPD officers were in the courtroom. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate is accused of ambushing and shooting Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 outside a Manhattan hotel where the head of the United States' largest health insurer was walking to an investor conference. Authorities have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport, fake IDs and about $10,000 when he was arrested on Dec. 9 while eating breakfast at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Mangione, 26, of Towson, Maryland, was arrested on Dec. 9 when police were called to a McDonald's restaurant on a commercial strip in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after he was reported to match the description of Thompson's killer. The shooting of Thompson was captured on security video, but the suspect eluded police before Mangione was captured 446 kilometers west of New York. Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a prominent family, was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies 'parasitic' and complained about corporate greed, according to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-will-return-to-new-york-to-face-murder-charges/7907114.html	2024-12-19T08:04:33-08:00	
French court finds 51 defendants guilty in mass rape trial	After a French court Thursday found all 51 defendants guilty in a drugging-and-rape case, the victim, Gisele Pelicot said that the trial has been a 'difficult ordeal,' but that she never regretted making the case public. Following a four-month trial in the southeastern city of Avignon, Pelicot’s ex-husband of 50 years, 72-year-old Dominique Pelicot, received a sentence of a maximum of 20 years in prison. He pleaded guilty in September to repeatedly drugging his wife, raping her while she was unconscious and recruiting strangers to join him over a period of 10 years. The five-judge panel handed Pelicot’s 50 co-defendants, a group of men from 27 to 74 years old, sentences ranging from three to 20 years in prison. In her first comments following the verdicts, Gisele Pelicot told reporters her first thoughts were with her three children and her grandchildren, 'because they are the future, and it is also for them that I have fought this battle.' She said she was also thinking of all the other families affected 'by this tragedy.' Finally, she said, 'I think of the unrecognized victims whose stories often remain in the shadows. I want you to know that we share the same struggle.' Pelicot has become a symbol of courage and resilience to many, and crowds of supporters gathered outside the courthouse as the case went on. Asked by reporters about complaints by her supporters that the sentences were too lenient, Pelicot said she respected the court and the decision. She said, 'I trust, now, in our capacity to collectively seize a future in which each one of us, woman and man, may live in harmony with mutual respect and understanding.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-court-finds-51-defendants-guilty-in-mass-rape-trial/7907101.html	2024-12-19T07:54:36-08:00	
UN chief names Mexican lawyer to determine fate of Syria’s missing	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday that he is appointing the former head of Mexico’s National Search Commission to head an independent mechanism for determining the fate of tens of thousands of missing and forcibly disappeared persons in Syria. 'We pledge our support to those who continue to live with the agony of uncertainty,' Guterres said of the families of the missing. In June 2023, the U.N. General Assembly created the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria, or IIMP. It is mandated to establish the fate and whereabouts of all missing persons in Syria, and to support victims, including survivors and families of the missing. 'I am announcing today the appointment of Karla Quintana of Mexico as head of this Institution,' Guterres told reporters. 'She and her team must be allowed to fully carry out their mandate.' From February 2019 to August 2023, Quintana was the national commissioner for the Search of Missing Persons in Mexico, where more than 110,000 people are listed as missing or disappeared, mostly because of organized crime. Quintana, 46, a human rights lawyer and professor, will have a mammoth task ahead of her. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, or SNHR, says at least 157,634 people went missing from the start of the Syrian civil war in March 2011 until August 2024. Since the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria on Dec. 8, prison doors in many parts of the country have been opened and thousands of the detained released. Mass graves have been discovered. But families continue to search for information about tens of thousands of loved ones who are still unaccounted for. In an interview with VOA last week, SNHR Founder and Director Fadel Abdul Ghany said about 105,000 people are still unaccounted for and the organization believes that 'the vast majority' of them are dead. Political transition The U.N. chief also urged an 'inclusive, credible and peaceful' Syrian-led political process, saying they must manage the situation carefully or risk progress unraveling. In the meantime, he said the United Nations is shifting its humanitarian response inside the country to respond to the new situation on the ground. Guterres’ new humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, has been on the ground in Damascus, Aleppo and Homs this week. After 14 years of civil war, Syria already was one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with 17 million people — more than 70% of the population — in need of assistance and funding in short supply. The U.N. chief warned that the war is 'still far from over.' He pointed to 'significant hostilities' in the north, the threat to 'many parts' of Syria from Islamic State fighters, and ongoing Israeli airstrikes and military movement in the zone where U.N. peacekeepers patrol between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. 'They are violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They must stop,' he said of the Israeli strikes, which have targeted military facilities, including chemical weapons stockpiles and the entire Syrian navy. 'Syria’s sovereignty, territorial unity, and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end,' Guterres said. 'This is a decisive moment — a moment of hope and history, but also one of great uncertainty.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-names-mexican-lawyer-to-determine-fate-of-syria-missing/7907110.html	2024-12-19T07:52:18-08:00	
Ukrainian military gets NATO-standard training in Poland, Lithuania	Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian soldiers have been receiving training from NATO troops.

Amazon workers strike at seven US facilities ahead of Christmas rush	Amazon.com workers at seven U.S. facilities walked off the job early on Thursday during the holiday shopping rush, aiming to pressure the retailer into contract talks with their union. Warehouse workers in cities including New York, Atlanta and San Francisco are taking part in the 'largest' strike against Amazon, said the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the firm's facilities. The company, however, said it does not expect any effect on its operations during one of the busiest times of the year. Unions represent only about 1% of the hourly workforce of Amazon, the world's second-largest private employer after Walmart, and it has multiple locations in many metro areas. The Teamsters had given Amazon a Dec. 15 deadline to begin negotiations and warehouse workers had recently voted to authorize a strike. 'If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon's insatiable greed,' Teamsters' General President Sean O'Brien said late on Wednesday. 'We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it. This strike is on them.' The retailer's shares were trading 1.5% higher in premarket hours, a sign that investors do not expect a big disruption from the strike. The Teamsters have 'intentionally misled the public' and 'threatened, intimidated and attempted to coerce' employees and third-party drivers to join them, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday. Observers said Amazon was unlikely to come to the table to bargain as that could open the door to more union actions. It employs more than 800,000 people at its U.S. warehouses and has more than 600 fulfillment centers, delivery stations and same-day facilities in the country. Amazon has responded to recent organization efforts with legal challenges. Amazon has filed objections with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) over a 2022 union vote in Staten Island, alleging bias among agency officials. It also challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB in a September federal lawsuit. Earlier this year, the company announced a $2.1 billion investment to raise pay for fulfillment and transportation employees in the U.S., increasing base wages for employees by at least $1.50 to around $22 per hour, a roughly 7% increase.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-workers-strike-at-seven-us-facilities-ahead-of-christmas-rush/7907005.html	2024-12-19T06:23:10-08:00	
China lets Sweden, Finland, Germany, Denmark board ship in cable breach case	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK — China has allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board a Chinese bulk carrier at the center of an investigation into Baltic Sea cable breaches, the Danish foreign minister said on Thursday. The Yi Peng 3 vessel is wanted in Sweden for questioning over a breach of two undersea fiber-optic cables in November and has been stationary in waters nearby for a month while diplomats in Stockholm and Beijing discussed the matter. Investigators quickly zeroed in on the ship, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, and a Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data showed that the vessel's coordinates corresponded to the time and place of the breaches. The Baltic Sea cables, one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania, were damaged on Nov. 17 and 18, prompting German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to say he assumed it was caused by sabotage. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on Thursday said his country had facilitated a meeting earlier this week between representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and China, helping break a monthlong standoff. 'It is our expectation that once the inspection has been completed by this group of people from the four countries, the ship will be able to sail towards its destination,' Lokke Rasmussen said. LSEG data showed Yi Peng 3 remained anchored in the same spot in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden. Swedish police in a statement said they participated on board the vessel as observers only, while Chinese authorities conducted investigations. 'In parallel, the preliminary investigation into sabotage in connection with two cable breaks in the Baltic Sea is continuing,' the police said. The actions taken on board the ship on Thursday were not part of the Swedish-led preliminary investigation, the police added. The breaches happened in Sweden's exclusive economic zone and Swedish prosecutors are leading the investigation on suspicion of possible sabotage. Western intelligence officials from multiple countries have said they are confident the Chinese ship caused the cuts to both cables. They have expressed different views on whether these were accidents or could have been deliberate. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson had urged the ship to return to Sweden to aid the investigation. The was no immediate response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry outside of business hours on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-lets-sweden-finland-germany-denmark-board-ship-in-cable-breach-case/7906994.html	2024-12-19T06:19:08-08:00	
Pakistan defends ballistic missile development amid new US sanctions	Islamabad — Pakistan sharply criticized the United States Thursday for imposing new sanctions against the nuclear-armed country’s long-range ballistic missile program, labeling the move as 'double standards and discriminatory practices.' U.S. State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller announced the measures on Wednesday, saying they were imposed under an executive order that 'targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.' Miller said the sanctions cover Pakistan’s state-owned National Defense Complex and three entities collaborating with it in the development of long-range ballistic missiles, including the Shaheen services of missiles. Pakistan’s foreign ministry rejected the move as 'unfortunate and biased.' The ministry statement said Islamabad’s defense capabilities are aimed at safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and preserving peace in South Asia. 'The latest installment of sanctions defies the objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,' the ministry said, apparently referring to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed neighbor India. 'Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,' the ministry warned, without elaborating. The designation of National Defense Complex and other firms freezes all U.S. property they own and bars U.S. citizens from engaging in business transactions with them. 'Pakistan’s strategic program is a sacred trust bestowed by 240 million people upon its leadership. The sanctity of this trust, held in the highest esteem across the entire political spectrum, cannot be compromised,' the foreign ministry stated Thursday in response to the U.S. announcement. The accompanying U.S. State Department fact sheet said the Islamabad-based National Defense Complex has worked to acquire items 'intended to be used as launch support equipment for ballistic missiles and missile testing equipment' to advance the country’s missile development program. The other companies hit with U.S. sanctions are Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd., and Rockside Enterprise, all located in Karachi, according to the fact sheet. 'The United States will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,' Miller said. Pakistan’s Shaheen surface-to-surface rocket is capable of carrying nuclear warheads to a range of approximately 2,750 kilometers, with experts saying the range enables the solid-fueled, multistage missile to reach targets anywhere in India and parts of the Middle East. New Delhi and Islamabad conducted their first nuclear weapons tests in May 1998, raising fears another war between the arch-rivals could escalate into a nuclear exchange in South Asia. Both nations have fought three wars, resulting in strained relations and persistent military tensions. India and Pakistan oppose and refuse to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty, an international agreement aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 'These country-specific U.S. sanctions against a close and longstanding strategic partner like Pakistan are unfortunate, divorced from historical realities, and indicate weaker U.S. commitment towards regional peace, security and strategic stability,' Syed Muhammad Ali, a security expert based in Islamabad, told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-defends-ballistic-missile-development-amid-new-us-sanctions/7906934.html	2024-12-19T05:45:40-08:00	
White House: NATO membership necessary for Ukraine security guarantees but invitation decision up to next president	WASHINGTON — As President Joe Biden’s administration prepares to transfer power to the incoming team of President-elect Donald Trump, VOA Ukrainian Iuliia Iarmolenko spoke with Michael Carpenter, the National Security Council director for Europe. Carpenter discussed the Biden administration's final efforts to strengthen Ukraine and why it would take more time and resources from Washington to start successful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. VOA: In September, we talked about Ukraine's 'victory plan' and now it seems like the conversation is moving towards the negotiation process. Do you think the victory of Ukraine is still possible? And is there something that the Biden administration can still do to help Ukraine achieve that goal? Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at National Security Council: I do. I do think victory is possible. I think Ukraine must prevail. I think for the good of the international order, for the good of security in Europe and for the good of all those brave Ukrainians that are fighting for their freedom, it must prevail. The question is, what can we do now to set Ukraine up to be in a position of strength? It's going to take a dedicated effort of providing additional security assistance in order to stabilize the lines. And it's going to take a range of other efforts, including macro financial assistance, humanitarian support, support for the energy sector. But this is underway. And this administration, although it only has a month left in office, will continue to surge the support and it will spend every penny. Every dollar of security assistance that has been authorized for Ukraine will be obligated by the end of this year. VOA: But is there enough time? The Pentagon yesterday said that they might not be able to use every dollar, every penny of the remaining funding to provide security assistance. Michael Carpenter: Oh, they will. They will. Now, some of that security assistance is on contract, so some of it will not arrive until 2025. But all of the money will be spent down by January 20th. VOA: Air defense continues to be the biggest issue for Ukrainian civilians. In that remaining time, will the air defense be prioritized in order to give Ukrainian civilians some kind of protection? Michael Carpenter: Of all the capabilities that Ukraine needs, air defense is the most important one because this goes to the protection of cities which Russia has been targeting, targeting relentlessly with its drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, including the Oreshnik. And then also for critical infrastructure. It's really important to have, maybe not always Patriots, but a smaller version of an air defense system. So that is absolutely the priority. The problem is that a lot of our partners and allies have dug so deep into their own stocks that they don't have a whole lot left to give. So we are talking with all of our allies, seeing what else we can possibly get in advance of the winter to give Ukraine the air defense that it needs. VOA: President-elect Trump and his team talk about ending the war in 24 hours. And they also say that they're coordinating their work with the current administration. Is there a consensus between the two teams about the need for a just peace in Ukraine, not just for an end of fighting? Michael Carpenter: I can't speak for the Trump administration that's coming into office soon. You'll have to ask them for their views. What I can say is that in order for a negotiation to be successful, it has to be leveraged appropriately. And so Ukraine needs to be able to approach that negotiation from a position of strength, which first and foremost means stopping the erosion of the forward line of troops in the Donbas and at least stabilizing those lines, if not reversing the momentum. That's going to take some time. So it's going to take into 2025 and it's going to take resources. It's going to take additional security assistance, in order for Ukraine to be able to do that. Now, look, the notion that the Russians are really strong right now is, I think, false. We have seen that as many as 600,000 Russian casualties have accumulated over the course of these 2½ years of war and the Russian economy of course, inflation, is picking up. Interest rates are at 21%, potentially even going higher. Russia's not 10 feet tall. But, that said, we will have to resource Ukraine in order for it to be able to prevail. And no matter what administration or what country you're in, and what political party you affiliate with, that is an objective fact, that Ukraine will need to have the strength provided by resources to be able to approach Russia and have a negotiation where they can protect their sovereignty and independence. VOA: What is your message to the next administration? How do you hope they will approach this issue of Russia's war against Ukraine? And how do you think they can give Ukraine that leverage that it needs for any possible negotiations? Michael Carpenter: Well, I think that the fundamental message is that whether you're concerned about the growing influence and capability of the PRC, of Chinese unfair market practices, of what they're doing in terms of intellectual property rights and the theft of intellectual property, whether you're talking about other types of malign influence that the PRC projects, all of it is related in some way to the war in Ukraine, because Ukraine is about the fundamental basis within the international system upon which everything else rests, that sovereignty, its territorial integrity, it’s the inviolability of borders. If you don't protect that in Ukraine, you don't protect it anywhere. And so, regardless of what team we're talking to, what administration, what country, this centrality of Ukraine, not that this is some faraway conflict where, you know, two countries have a dispute over territory. It's much bigger than that. That has to be the fundamental message. VOA: President Zelenskyy said that invitation for Ukraine to join NATO would help to stop a 'hot phase' of the war. And he says that he intends to speak to President Biden about it. Should we expect any change of heart on this in Washington? Michael Carpenter: I think it's for the new team to decide on the NATO invitation. What I can say is that, ultimately, for Ukraine to have its security protected, it needs to be in NATO. There is nothing else that matches NATO's Article Five in terms of a security guarantee, because it's distributed across 32 allies and because it carries the weight of all of their collective defense capability. So this is where Ukraine obviously needs to get. It needs to have membership in the alliance. And at the NATO's summit in Washington last July, we all said that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to membership. That has to be the goal. The question is how long is it going to take for the 32 allies and their parliaments to ratify NATO's membership? It's going to take time. And what we need to do in the meantime, is we need to think about what kind of security guarantees, what kind of security assistance, do we need to help to tide Ukraine over, until such time as it has an Article Five guarantee? VOA: But why [has] President Biden decided that it's not the time to invite Ukraine? Because allies say that Washington and Berlin are the two capitals that are not greenlighting the invitation for Ukraine to join NATO. Michael Carpenter: Look, if the United States is going to support an invitation, it has to be something that is supported across administrations. It can't be that one administration supports it and then the next rescinds the invitation. It has to be durable. And so, you know, that's why I think this administration is not going to take any action on this without the support of the next administration. So basically, it's up to them to pursue this. But as I said earlier, the fact that Ukraine must be in NATO to have its security guarantees – I think that's an irrefutable fact. And so the question is the timeline and how do you build unity. Because you also don't want to have a fight within NATO where some countries are supportive and others are against. You need to align the diplomacy with the goals. And so you need to have all 32 allies saying, yes, now is the moment, and then we should do it together. So there's going to be a lot of behind-closed-doors conversation about this that I assume will take place over the course of the coming months into the new administration. And, you know, our team, President Biden, you know, will be supportive of those conversations and will be guiding the next team on this to the extent that they want to take that advice. Of course, this is going to be their call. VOA: Looking back at the Biden administration's response to Russia's war against Ukraine some critics say is that half-measures, indecision, hesitation, did not allow Ukraine to be fully successful. Is there something that President Biden wishes he could have done differently? Michael Carpenter: Look, I think there'll be time in the future to look at the lessons learned from this war, what could have been done differently. The fact of the matter is, there were different phases of this war. There was the initial assault on Kyiv when antitank weapons were paramount. And that was a capability that really, truly mattered on the battlefield. At later stages of the war, tanks did not figure as prominently, and so anti-tank weapons were perhaps less important. Then we started talking about F-16s and we started talking about air defense systems, Patriot systems and other sorts of capabilities. So each phase of this war has brought new capabilities to light that were that were critical in that phase. The reality is that neither the United States nor any of our other allies had massive surplus stocks of these capabilities available. For example, ATACMS [the Army Tactical Missile System] missiles, especially the long-range variants. None of us, not the United States, certainly not our allies, had large numbers of these missiles available, just to be able to hand over to Ukraine from one day to the next. So it's taken time. The one thing we've discovered is our defense industrial base in the United States needs a lot more investment. It needs to be ramped up dramatically to be able to deal with these sorts of contingencies. That's what we've learned. And then there's also the other piece to this, which is that the key variable in the fight currently is manpower. We can talk about all the types of capabilities and the weapons and the munitions that we want. But at the end of the day, the most important variable is how many troops does each country have on the front lines. And there we just simply see that Russia has numerical superiority. And so we have to devise a strategy going forward for how we can help Ukraine to recruit more people, to bring more people in, to serve on the front lines, even as Western countries provide the training and equipment. But just talking about the training and equipping without factoring in this manpower issue is not really doing justice to the situation as it stands on the front lines. VOA: But is there enough equipment? Michael Carpenter: The limiting factor right now is not equipment. I will tell you, there are a lot of munitions in Ukraine stocks right now. We have pledged, Western countries, not just the United States, our allies as well, that we will train every Ukrainian soldier that the Ukrainian armed forces can bring forward. VOA: President Zelenskyy right now is in Brussels. Do you think right now is the time for European allies to step up their support for Ukraine? Michael Carpenter: Unambiguously, yes. Absolutely. It is time for our European partners and allies to step up, to look at their stocks, to look at their defense industrial base. We have ramped up ours considerably. We still have a lot of work to do. It is not where we would like it to be. But when you take something like, for example, 155 [mm] ammunition, we have doubled and then doubled again, our production capability. In Europe, it lags far behind. So we need our European allies to step up and look at these key capabilities. When you talk about air defense systems, we just spoke about that. We need our European partners to also be able to produce air defense and to be able to give those systems to Ukraine or wherever else they may be needed. So this is not just about the United States. This is about our allies stepping up, too. They've done a lot. They've done a lot in terms of the overall figure of support that's been provided. But when you look country by country, certainly there are some countries that could do a lot more.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-nato-membership-necessary-for-ukraine-security-guarantees-but-invitation-decision-up-to-next-president/7906919.html	2024-12-19T05:26:26-08:00	
Stampede in southwestern Nigerian city causes multiple deaths	ABUJA — A stampede at a religious event in Ibadan, the capital of Nigeria's southwest Oyo state, resulted in multiple deaths and injuries, Governor Seyi Makinde said on Wednesday. The incident occurred at an Islamic high school where a large crowd had gathered for a family event. 'While investigations are ongoing, the primary organizers of the event that led to this stampede have been taken into custody,' Makinde said in a statement posted on X. Reuters could not immediately establish how many people had died or what caused the incident. Emergency services, including medical personnel and ambulances, were immediately dispatched to the scene, Makinde said. Security forces were also deployed to control the situation and prevent further casualties. The event has been halted, and the rest of the attendees have been safely evacuated from the venue, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stampede-in-southwestern-nigerian-city-causes-multiple-deaths/7906899.html	2024-12-19T04:56:14-08:00	
Putin says Assad ouster not a defeat for Russia	Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday rejected the notion that the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad represented a defeat for Russia. Putin said during his annual news conference that Russia had 'achieved our goals' in Syria, where it rushed to provide direct military support for Assad’s government more than nine years ago to help push back rebel fighters. Russian forces operated out of a network of bases in Syria to carry out airstrikes that helped Assad’s military gain an advantage in the civil war. After rebels made a surprise surge that toppled Assad’s government earlier this month, Assad fled to Russia. Putin said Thursday he had not yet met with Assad but planned to do so. Among the topics Putin said he would discuss is the whereabouts of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared while reporting in Syria in 2012. Putin also said he could ask those now in control in Syria about Tice. Syrian transition U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Syrians face an 'incredibly fraught' opportunity as they work to shift away from decades of Assad family rule to a new future. Speaking at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations, Blinken said the question is whether Syrians will 'seize an opportunity for the first time in decades not to be governed by a dictator, not to be governed by an outside power, not to be governed by a terrorist organization, not be governed by one sect or minority over another.' He also pointed to the rebels who seized power, and the opportunity they have to engage with the outside world and not take actions that will isolate the country. Blinken highlighted the example of the Taliban in Afghanistan, saying the group pledged to be more moderate after it seized control but ultimately acted otherwise and ended up 'terribly isolated around the world.' He said those in Syria need to move the country forward in an inclusive, nonsectarian way, to protect minorities, and deal with security challenges such as chemical weapons and groups such as the Islamic State. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-assad-ouster-not-a-defeat-for-russia/7906885.html	2024-12-19T04:44:05-08:00	
Vietnam police arrest suspect in Hanoi cafe fire that killed 11	Hanoi — Police in Vietnam have arrested a man suspected of starting a blaze that killed 11 following an argument with staff in a Hanoi cafe, authorities said on Thursday, while two of seven pulled from the flames were admitted to hospital. In a statement, police said the man had confessed to using gasoline to set Wednesday's fire on the ground floor of the three-story cafe, where people were also singing karaoke-style. The suspect is in his early 50s, said the state-run Tien Phong newspaper, adding that one witness reported hearing an explosion. 'The fire blocked all the exits,' another witness told the paper. 'The smell of gasoline was strong.' It took about 40 minutes to rein in the fire, reported just after 11 p.m., police added, with two of the seven rescued admitted to hospital. Images in an online newspaper, VnExpress, showed firemen working to douse the flames, while the bodies of several victims were carried away. 'I noticed a column of smoke from afar,' it cited a witness as saying. 'I was so frightened that I had to urge my grandchild to go downstairs.' 'The flames were so fierce. We saw the fire ... but there was nothing else we could do.' On Thursday, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called for urgent investigation and strict action against anyone who violated the law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-police-arrest-suspect-in-hanoi-cafe-fire-that-killed-11/7906848.html	2024-12-19T03:54:20-08:00	
Dominique Pelicot jailed for 20 years in landmark French mass rape trial	AVIGNON, France — A French court found all 51 defendants guilty on Thursday in a drugging-and-rape case that horrified the world and transformed the victim, Gisele Pelicot, into a stirring symbol of courage and resilience. Pelicot's ex-husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had pleaded guilty to drugging her repeatedly for almost a decade to rape her and to offer up her unconscious body for sex to dozens of strangers he had met online, while video recording the abuse. A panel of five judges sentenced him to the maximum 20 years in jail, as requested by prosecutors. The court imposed generally shorter terms than the four-to-18 years demanded by the prosecution for the other defendants, almost all of whom were accused of raping the comatose Gisele Pelicot. In all, the court found 47 of the defendants guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. A cheer went up outside the court in the southern French city of Avignon among the victim's supporters when news of the first guilty verdicts filtered out. Many of the accused had denied the charges, saying they thought it was a consensual sex game orchestrated by the couple and arguing that it was not rape if the husband approved. Dominique Pelicot, 72, denied misleading the men, saying they knew exactly what they were doing. 'I am a rapist like the others in this room,' he said during testimony. Gisele, who is also 72, waived her right to anonymity during the trial and demanded that horrifying videos of the serial abuse, which were recorded by her former husband, should be seen in court, saying she hoped this would help other women speak up. The trial has triggered protest rallies around France in support of Gisele, and spurred soul searching, including a debate on whether to update France's rape law, which at present makes no mention that sex should involve consent. Gisele stared down her abusers with steely determination in the packed courtroom day after day, scoffing at any claim that she might have been a willing participant. 'I've decided not to be ashamed, I've done nothing wrong,' she testified in October. 'They are the ones who must be ashamed,' she said. Horrifying secrets The Pelicots' children, David, Caroline and Florian, arrived in court to hear the verdict alongside their mother. The siblings have spoken out forcibly against their father, rejecting his pleas for forgiveness. The defendants come from all walks of life - lorry drivers, soldiers, firefighters, security guards, farm workers, a supermarket worker, a journalist and the unemployed. The youngest suspect was just 22 when he entered Pelicot's bedroom, while the oldest was in his early 70s. Many had children and were in relationships. Most lived within a 50-km radius of the Pelicots' picturesque village of Mazan, which nestles in vineyards below Mont Ventoux. The case only came to light in 2020, when Dominique was caught trying to take photographs up the skirts of women in a supermarket. Police then discovered more than 20,000 photos and videos on his computer drives revealing the horrifying secrets that he had hidden from his now ex-wife for a decade. Police believe 72 men had gone to the house to rape and abuse Gisele, but they were not able to identify them all. Pelicot acknowledged that he had put powerful tranquilizers into his wife's food and coffee that put her to sleep for hours. Gisele said she was worried she was developing Alzheimer's or had a brain tumor because of the memory gaps. She says she hopes the enormous interest in her case will help other women who have suffered sexual abuse, and brushes off praise for her own bravery in letting the world see her pain. 'It's not courage. It's determination to change things,' she told the court in October. 'This is not just my battle, but that of all rape victims.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominique-pelicot-jailed-for-20-years-in-landmark-french-mass-rape-trial/7906841.html	2024-12-19T03:42:16-08:00	
Putin says Russia is moving closer to achieving goals in Ukraine	Moscow — President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield in Ukraine and touted what he said was the invincibility of Russia's new hypersonic missile. Fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front. 'I must say that the situation is changing dramatically... There is movement along the entire front line. Every day,' he said. Western and Russian military analysts say Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine at the fastest pace since 2022, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub. 'Our fighters are reclaiming territory by the square kilometer every day,' Putin said. He said the fighting was complex, so it was 'difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.' 'Everyone is fighting, literally heroically. And they are fighting right now. Let us wish them all...good luck, victory and to return home,' he said. Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen. Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the 'Oreshnik' hypersonic missile which Russia has already test- fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organize another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defense systems could shoot it down. 'There is no chance of shooting down these missiles,' said Putin. 'Let Western experts propose to us, and let them propose to those in the West and the U.S. who pay them for their analysis, to conduct some kind of technological experiment, say, a high-tech duel of the 21st century. 'Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defense and missile defense forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-russia-is-moving-closer-to-achieving-goals-in-ukraine/7906830.html	2024-12-19T03:25:09-08:00	
Polish defense chief: Poland ready to face Russia’s threats	Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz laid out his country’s plans to deal with feared Russian aggression, such as possible missile infiltrations and conflict on its borders, in an interview with VOA Eastern Europe Bureau Chief Myroslava Gongadze. Plans include bolstering air defenses to building a $2.1 billion 'East Shield,' he said Tuesday. 'Polish F-16s are ready to act if a missile threatens our territory,' he said, confirming the military’s heightened readiness amid the war in Ukraine. Kosiniak-Kamysz emphasized the urgency of European countries pulling their weight in defense, warning that NATO’s unity is key to keeping American forces in Europe. With the war in Ukraine showing no signs of letting up, Poland is leading the charge in Europe, spending more on defense than any other NATO member and urging others to follow suit. This interview, translated from Polish, has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: You're buying a lot of equipment from the United States. How do you assess this cooperation, and what are you looking forward to? Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz: Our cooperation is really at the best possible level. I have concluded several contracts worth dozens of billions of dollars, including the purchase of 26 Apache aircraft. Poland will be one of the best armies equipped with attack aircraft, Apaches. We're talking about a strategic partnership, and I think we are meeting President [-elect Donald] Trump's expectations. We're spending a lot on armaments, and we have good trade relations. We're buying a lot of equipment in the U.S. That's a guarantee of security, as well as it is investment in U.S. production. VOA: How do you assess the Russian threat today, and who are Poland’s main adversaries? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Russia is the greatest threat since the end of World War II. Many people have said that since the end of the second World War, but today, it's not the Cold War. We have an active war just beyond our border. We have crises — a conflict in the Near East. We have a conflict situation in the Pacific and also, recently, the developments in Syria have totally changed the position of Russia, Iran and other countries. So, we are living in very difficult times. Poland is spending 4.7% of its GDP —the greatest amount among NATO member states on defense — on armaments. Why are we spending that money? Because the situation is utmost difficult. The threat from Russia is realistic. The citizens of Ukraine are experiencing it every day. VOA: How important it is to invest in defense, and how would you encourage others to put more into defense? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Two percent is not enough. It is the absolute minimum. I believe that the 2% of GDP that NATO countries have committed to, and those that do not meet it, will not even be invited to the table with the new Trump administration. ... So, all countries must fulfill their obligations. ... Europe must do more for security, not to replace the Americans in Europe, but to keep them in Europe. If we do not spend more on security, if other countries do not follow Poland's example, we will not be able to keep Americans in Europe. The EU has created the program for defense development, but it has assigned just 1.5 billion euros ($1.55 billion). It's just symbolic. Where are the capacities to manufacture the munitions that North Korea, Russia and Iran have? Europe, as well as the Western world, the U.S., Canada and our allies don't have those capacities. We have to make up for it. 100 billion euros ($103 billion) — that would be the money we should be talking about. VOA: So, are you saying that Europe is not ready to fight the active war today? Kosiniak-Kamysz: We are ready — we have to be ready each day. But Europe has to be more ready to a better extent each day. So, it's not enough to say that we are ready and do nothing. A lot has happened since the outbreak of war in Ukraine. But it's still not enough to say that it's at the best level. We have to be ready to fight each time of day and night, each state. We are prepared for that. But each day, we could be prepared better, hence the pressure that we are exerting on other countries. Hence the building of a resilient society. This is something that Western societies don't have today. ... We have already been attacked with lies, fake news, with misinformation. And it does not matter if you live next to the border with the Kaliningrad region, near the Belarusian border here in Poland, or [if] you live in Portugal, in Quebec, or anyplace today. You are being attacked. Russia has already attacked you. VOA: Poland has experienced Belarusian helicopters entering its airspace. A Russian missile violated Poland’s airspace during an attack on Ukraine. Is Poland ready to do something about it? Kosiniak-Kamysz: The situation of infringing the airspace of Poland also affects Latvia, often affecting Romania with UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), and we've prepared the air defense system. We also have enhanced air defense. We're talking about Rzeszow Airport, which is almost being passed onto the protection of NATO. Our allies —America, Britain, Germany, Norway and other nations — are protecting us at the air base. And if that airspace is infringed, then the target missile or a drone can be shot [down]. ... But it's a different situation when it comes to shooting targets above the Ukrainian territory. There is no NATO decision on that position, or agreement to do so. We are protecting our territories. VOA: Are you saying that if a rocket infiltrates Polish airspace, you're ready to shoot them down? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Very often, we activate our F-16s to act accordingly, if there is a danger to Polish territory, to defend our territory. VOA: But it hasn't happened yet? Kosiniak-Kamysz: No, because there has been no such event where the missile would be aimed at a target in the Polish territory. But yes, last week, the Polish F-16s took off and were ready to protect near the border. VOA: There are talks about the defense line you’re building on the eastern border called the 'East Shield.' What are the plans for that for the next year or two? Kosiniak-Kamysz: This is preparation for the event of a conflict on the Polish-Russian, Polish-Belarusian borders. We are building barriers that will complicate the movement of enemy troops. We are also building warehouses for artillery and other means of defense. We are building places for the defense of manpower. .... This should be combined with the Baltic line of defense, [and] strengthening the Russian-Finnish border. In addition, we are increasing protection against illegal migrants. VOA: French President Emmanuel Macron visited Poland last week and hinted at the idea of Polish and French military personnel going to Ukraine as security guarantees if a peace agreement is signed. Poland declared it was not planning to do so. Why? Kosiniak-Kamysz: We have not seen any peace plan from President Trump yet. There are many reports in the press about this or that outcome, following the example of Finland, or the example of Germany, but these are all speculations. We exclude the possibility of the Polish military being on the territory of Ukraine. We believe that such decisions should not be made by the group of countries, but NATO should have a key role in this decision. We will consider further steps when that stage comes. At this stage, as you said, we do not plan to send troops to Ukraine. VOA: So, if NATO would make that decision, you're open to it? Kosiniak-Kamysz: Well, we'll see. I won't be making any declarations here. I'm just saying that we are not planning to deploy any troops to Ukraine, as long as the peace process has not been finalized, and that is not possible without Ukraine at the table.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-defense-chief-poland-ready-to-face-russia-s-threats-/7906788.html	2024-12-19T02:08:37-08:00	
US deaths are down and life expectancy is up, but improvements are slowing	NEW YORK — U.S. life expectancy jumped last year, and preliminary data suggests there may be another — much smaller — improvement this year. Death rates fell last year for almost all leading causes, notably COVID-19, heart disease and drug overdoses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Thursday. That translated to adding nearly a year the estimated lifespan of Americans. Experts note it's part of a bounce-back from the COVID-19 pandemic. But life expectancy has not yet climbed back to prepandemic levels, and the rebound appears to be losing steam. 'What you're seeing is continued improvement, but slowing improvement,' said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, a University Minnesota researcher who studies death trends. 'We are sort of converging back to some kind of normal that is worse than it was before the pandemic.' Last year, nearly 3.1 million U.S. residents died, about 189,000 fewer than the year before. Death rates declined across all racial and ethnic groups, and in both men and women. Provisional data for the first 10 months of 2024 suggests the country is on track to see even fewer deaths this year, perhaps about 13,000 fewer. But that difference is likely to narrow as more death certificates come in, said the CDC's Robert Anderson. That means that life expectancy for 2024 likely will rise — 'but probably not by a lot,' said Anderson, who oversees death tracking at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a baby born in a given year might expect to live, given death rates at that time. It's a fundamental measure of a population's health. For decades, U.S. life expectancy rose at least a little bit almost every year, thanks to medical advances and public health measures. It peaked in 2014, at nearly 79 years, and then was relatively flat for several years. Then it plunged during the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping to just under 76 1/2 years in 2021. It rebounded to 77 1/2 years in 2022 and, according to the new report, to nearly 78 1/2 last year. Life expectancy for U.S. women continues to be well above that of men — a little over 81 for women, compared with a little under 76 for men. In the last five years, more than 1.2 million U.S. deaths have been attributed to COVID-19. But most of them occurred in 2020 and 2021, before vaccination- and infection-induced immunity became widespread. The coronavirus was once the nation's third leading cause of death. Last year it was the underlying cause in nearly 50,000 deaths, making it the nation's No. 10 killer. Data for 2024 is still coming in, but about 30,000 coronavirus deaths have been reported so far. At that rate, suicide may surpass COVID-19 this year, Anderson said. Heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death. Some underappreciated good news is the heart disease death rate dropped by about 3% in 2023. That’s a much smaller drop than the 73% decline in the COVID-19 death rate, but heart disease affects more people so even small changes can be more impactful, Anderson said. There's also good news about overdose deaths, which fell to 105,000 in 2023 among U.S. residents, according to a second report released by CDC on Thursday. The causes of the overdose decline are still being studied but there is reason to be hopeful such deaths will drop more in the future, experts say. Some pointed to survey results this week that showed teens drug use isn't rising. 'The earlier you start taking a drug, the greater the risk that you could continue using it and the greater the risk that you will become addicted to it — and have untoward consequences,' said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded the survey study. 'If you can reduce the pipeline (of new drug users) ... you can prevent overdoses.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deaths-are-down-and-life-expectancy-is-up-but-improvements-are-slowing/7906762.html	2024-12-19T00:16:13-08:00	
Malaysian court acquits wife of ex-PM of money laundering, tax evasion	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia's High Court on Thursday acquitted Rosmah Mansor, the wife of jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak, of money laundering and tax evasion, citing insufficient grounds to charge her. Najib and Rosmah have been the subject of multiple graft investigations since Najib's surprise election defeat in 2018, when voters' fury over his alleged role in a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) ended his nine years in power. Both have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Rosmah is not yet out of the woods, however, and is currently free on bail pending an appeal against a 10-year jail sentence in 2022 for soliciting and receiving bribes to help a company win a $279 million solar power supply project from Najib's government. Rosmah has been widely scorned in Malaysia for her extravagant lifestyle and penchant for luxury handbags, more than 500 of which were found at properties searched by police as part of investigations into the 1MDB scandal, on top of 12,000 items of jewelry. According to Thursday's High Court judgment seen by Reuters, Rosmah was acquitted of the 12 money laundering charges and five tax evasion charges against her, which it said lacked probity, propriety and legality. Rosmah said she was grateful the case had concluded and thanked her lawyers. 'I also want to thank the judge who has made the right decision. This is what I call justice, and this is the kind of justice that everybody should have,' she told a livestreamed news conference. Her acquittal follows the recent dropping of corruption charges against Najib linked to 1MDB due to procedural delays and the failure of the prosecution to disclose key documents. Najib faces several trials linked to the scandal at 1MDB, from which Malaysian and U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was stolen in a complex, globe-spanning scheme between 2009 and 2014. Najib, who helped found 1MDB when he was premier, was found guilty of corruption and money laundering in 2022 in a case linked to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022, though the term was later halved by a pardon's board chaired by Malaysia's king. Najib has also apologized for his role in mishandling the 1MDB scandal, though he maintained he had no knowledge of any illegal transfers from the state fund. Najib has been pressing to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysian-court-acquits-wife-of-ex-pm-of-money-laundering-tax-evasion/7906759.html	2024-12-19T00:05:07-08:00	
UN peacekeepers guard Congolese farmers working their fields	DHENDRO, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Under a scorching sun in the Democratic Republic of Congo, many of the farmers tending to their fields in the troubled eastern region are guarded by United Nations peacekeepers. The U.N. mission has fallen under increasing scrutiny over the years as the eastern conflict between rebel groups, self-defense forces and other militias has raged. But in this corner of Djugu territory in the village of Dhendro, farmers are unequivocal in their support for the U.N. force known by the acronym MONUSCO. The farmers, many displaced from their homes by the conflict, shelter in camps near the U.N. bases. 'I came here because of the presence of MONUSCO. It's thanks to their presence that I'm going to the field; otherwise I'm afraid,' 23-year-old Lokana Heritier, who left his village to live closer to the blue helmets, told Reuters. MONUSCO has been deployed in Congo since 2010, when it took over from an earlier U.N. operation to secure the troubled eastern region that borders Rwanda. The operation to guard farmers who grow corn, beans, potatoes and manioc is known as 'Secure Harvest' and it aims to allow them to work freely during the harvesting season and provide protection from militia groups who steal produce and kill people. 'The main objective is to secure the farmers in their farmland when they are working. We believe this is directly linked to the protection of civilians that MONUSCO is mandated for,' Brigadier General Monzurul Alam told Reuters. Last year, the U.N. Security Council approved the end of the mission at the request of President Felix Tshisekedi. The 13,500-strong force had faced attacks and protests over perceptions that it had failed to secure the population. Congo's government reversed course in July and asked MONUSCO to remain in Ituri and North Kivu provinces until conditions were met for the force's departure, without providing further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-peacekeepers-guard-congolese-farmers-working-their-fields/7906757.html	2024-12-18T23:57:06-08:00	
Russian officials report oil refinery fire after Ukraine targets border regions with dozens of drones	Officials in Russia’s Rostov region reported a fire Thursday at an oil refinery after a wave of attacks from several dozen Ukrainian aerial drones. Rostov acting Governor Yuri Slyusar said on Telegram that the fire happened at the Novoshakhtinsk refinery and was later extinguished. Slyusar reported one person was injured in the attack. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed 36 Ukrainian drones over Rostov, part of a total of 84 drones it shot down mostly over regions bordering Ukraine. The ministry said the other intercepts took place over Bryansk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Tambov and Krasnodar. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian drone attacks damaged several residential buildings. Ukraine’s military said Thursday its air defenses shot down 45 of 85 Russian drones used in overnight attacks targeting the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava and Sumy regions. The military also said Russian missiles damaged residential buildings and municipal property in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that the areas damaged included a school and a hospital in Kryvyi Rih. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-officials-report-oil-refinery-fire-after-ukraine-targets-border-regions-with-dozens-of-drones-/7906754.html	2024-12-18T23:46:21-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen	Israel’s military said Thursday it carried out airstrikes against Houthi militant targets in Yemen. A military spokesperson said the strikes targeted energy and port infrastructure used by the Houthis as part of their 'military action.' Houthi-run media reported attacks in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, and that the strikes hit a power station and an oil facility. A short time earlier, Israel said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen. The Houthis have conducted multiple missile attacks directed at Israel and have carried out more than a year of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Iran-backed Houthis say their campaign is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The United States has designated Hamas and the Houthis as terror groups.

US effort to curb China's and Russia's access to advanced computer chips 'inadequate,' report finds	WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department's efforts to curb China's and Russia's access to American-made advanced computer chips have been 'inadequate' and will need more funding to stymie their ability to manufacture advanced weapons, according to a report published Wednesday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The Biden administration imposed export controls to limit the ability of China and Russia to access U.S.-made chips after Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago. The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules. But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' to dismantle parts of the federal government. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. BIS’s budget, about $191 million, has remained essentially flat since 2010 when adjusted for inflation. 'While BIS’ budget has been stagnant for a decade, the bureau works diligently around the clock to meet its mission and safeguard U.S. national security,' Commerce Department spokesperson Charlie Andrews said in a statement in response to the report. Andrews added that with 'necessary resources from Congress' the agency would be 'better equipped to address the challenges that come with our evolving national security environment.' In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool. Blumenthal in a statement called on 'Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.' Texas Instruments said it opposes the use of its chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of its products to Russia. 'It is our policy to comply with export control laws, and any shipments of TI chips into Russia are illicit and unauthorized,' the company said in a statement. 'If we find evidence indicating product diversion, we investigate and take action.' It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia. Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls. China, meanwhile, has created 'vast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,' the subcommittee report asserts. Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden’s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S. But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement. The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks, the report said. The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies’ export control plans by outside entities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-effort-to-curb-china-s-and-russia-s-access-to-advanced-computer-chips-inadequate-report-finds-/7906729.html	2024-12-18T21:22:40-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: US senators threaten sanctions against Turkey over Syrian ceasefire proposal	U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Lindsey Graham have warned of bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if it rejects a ceasefire proposal from the U.S. and a plan by Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander Mazlum Abdi to establish a demilitarized zone in Kobani. The senators argue that Turkey’s attacks on Kurdish allies in Syria undermine regional stability and efforts to prevent a resurgence by Islamic State. The proposed initiative, supported by the SDF and under U.S. supervision, aims to address Turkey's security concerns while maintaining stability in northern Syria. With 900 U.S. troops still deployed in Syria as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, the senators emphasized the importance of Turkey’s cooperation in fostering long-term peace and security in the region.

Blinken emphasized the need for a Syrian government that respects human rights, safeguards the rights of women and minorities, and protects religious holy sites. He also stressed that Syria must not become a haven for terrorism or a threat to its neighbors. Prime Minister al-Sudani echoed these concerns, highlighting the necessity of a Syrian government that represents all communities to ensure lasting stability, while cautioning that Iraq expects concrete action, not just rhetoric.

Formed in 2014 to combat ISIS under a fatwa by Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Hashd al-Shaabi later became a formal part of Iraq’s military through legislation.

Expert: Several African governments unaware of young workers in Russian drone factories	WASHINGTON — They were promised a chance to earn money, get an education abroad, and gain work experience. Instead, they found themselves assembling military drones in Russia and, in one case, subjected to a Ukrainian drone strike. A series of investigative reports has shed light on a Russian labor recruitment program that has allegedly lured young African women to work at an industrial park in provincial Russia with false promises and coerced them into contributing to the Kremlin’s war effort in Ukraine. The reported victims of the program, which attracts recruits largely through online job advertisements, includes women from Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Media reports from The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and others have exposed the operation, entitled Alabuga Start, but VOA reporting has found that African countries have largely failed to intervene or give an official response. Some even appear to be building ties with the Russian entity behind the program. That entity called the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, has been intensifying its outreach across the African continent, according to David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security and the researcher behind a report exposing the program that exploited the young women. 'In some of the initial investigations of this, the recruiters in Africa were oblivious when they were asked where these women were going,' Albright said, adding that some are now aware and that he hopes there will be 'pushback from these governments about what exactly [Alabuga is] recruiting these women to do.' Albright said representatives from Alabuga recently visited Sierra Leone, Zambia and Madagascar, signing memorandums of cooperation with local organizations, despite the reports of misleading recruitment practices and questionable labor actions. Albright said the young women are forced to handle toxic materials, which he says is forbidden in Russian labor law. But African and other governments have also been willing to send their citizens off to Alabuga Start. VOA discovered a series of documents online indicating the government ministries had officially promoted the program. VOA reached out to authorities of Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Nigeria but several emails and phone calls went unanswered. VOA also requested comment from Alabuga and the Russian Embassy in Washington but received no response. Recruitment under false pretenses Located 1,000 kilometers to the east of Moscow in Russia’s Tatarstan region, the city of Yelabuga, known as Alabuga in the local Tatar language, would hardly seem a desirable location for young people from Africa. But the nearby Alabuga Special Economic Zone has been casting a wide net on the African continent. In promotional materials, it paints an exciting, optimistic picture of life in the Alabuga Start program. In one recruitment video intended to appeal to potential recruits, an African woman arrives in Alabuga and begins work at a restaurant, where she waits on a young Russian man. At the end of the video, she returns to the restaurant as his pregnant wife. Other promotional videos show participants working in construction, cleaning and warehouse operations, as well as studying and playing sports with their friends. Only one video features the women assembling drones, but no indication is given that the drones have a military purpose. According to the Russian independent news outlet Protokol, the program has specifically targeted young women because its organizers believe young men from Africa 'could be too aggressive and dangerous.' Researchers and reporters found that some of the program’s internal documents, as reported by Albright and others, often referred to the women as mulattos using an outdated racial term that is now widely considered offensive. Its appeal to African young people is not difficult to understand, says Maxim Matusevich, a Russia-Africa expert and a global history professor at Seton Hall University. 'A lot of these nations have very high unemployment rates,' he told VOA. Russia is 'offering them attractively packaged and attractively sold job packages.' Matusevich believes Alabuga Start aims to solve the problem of a shortfall of workers in Russia due to the heavy demand of the war in Ukraine. Albright said that inaction has global ramifications: Alabuga Start is involving young Africans in Russian violence against Ukrainians. 'It’s been a very deceptive program in the sense that the applicants didn’t know they’d be working in essentially a U.S.- [and] European-sanctioned company making drones that are being used to devastating effect against Ukrainian civil targets, energy targets, electrical plants,' he told VOA. 'And so, in that sense, they’re complicit in a crime, an international crime, given that the war against Ukraine is illegal. They’re getting involved in making drones that are being used against civilian targets, not just military targets.' Exploitation factory Alabuga didn’t start out exploiting young African women. Before that, it used young Russians in drone production. Since 2019, the special economic zone has operated a program called Alabuga Polytech, which recruits Russian high school students. Unlike workers from the African continent and other countries, the Russian students take part in a four-year work-study program, receiving accredited technical education while doing industrial work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, that program ramped up its activity. It hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing. When the program pivoted to drone production, Alabuga had to lobby the Russian authorities to alter labor laws. According to a July report from the Institute for Science and International Security, that allowed Alabuga to hire children under the age of 18 to work with toxic chemicals. Parents soon began to complain about the poor work conditions: Participants were working 12-hour factory shifts and their movements were strictly controlled, Albright recounted. He said the program has since stopped recruiting people younger than 18. When the special economic zone launched Alabuga Start and began recruiting workers from abroad in 2022, the program was almost entirely focused on drone production. According to estimates by Albright’s organization, only a third of Polytech students work on drone production, while over 90% of Alabuga Start participants do. Despite that stark distinction, organizers appear to have frequently conflated the two programs, including by sometimes depicting Alabuga Start participants wearing school uniforms in promotional materials. Multinational conveyer belt Alabuga’s recent outreach to African nations signals a potential expansion of its recruitment efforts. VOA found that African and other governments have at times been willing partners. Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Education shared on its website a document announcing open admissions to Alabuga Start in 2023. Uganda’s Ministry of Education and Sport shared a similar announcement. In the document upload site Scribd, a digital document library, VOA found two files that appear to be official letters from the government ministries of Mali and Burkina Faso announcing that Alabuga Start had reserved spots for participants from those countries in 2023. VOA also found a document by Bangladesh’s Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training announcing that applications were open for Alabuga Start in 2023. The special economic zone’s many meetings with African diplomats and government officials, some of which included the signing of memoranda of understanding, appear to signal a deepening of ties. Albright emphasizes that the special economic zone’s drone factory has been a linchpin of Russian-Iranian collaboration during the war against Ukraine. 'Alabuga is a special economic zone that basically builds and hires out or sells buildings for civilian industry,' he said. 'With the war in Ukraine, their international occupants pulled out and they were desperate for money. And so, they made a contract with the Russian government and the Iranian government to build drones.' The Alabuga factory in question primarily assembled the Shahed-136, an Iranian kamikaze drone. In the first half of 2023, around 100 Alabuga Polytech students traveled to Tehran for two months of training in Shahed-136 airframe production, The Washington Post reported in August 2023. Alabuga Start participants are largely used as low-skilled labor, assigned to complete the simplest tasks involved in assembling the airframes. A list of 100 Russian words that participants must know to take part in the program drives that conclusion home. It largely consists of basic vocabulary but also includes several higher-level words: 'to hook,' 'to unhook,' 'factory,' and 'task.' The military nature of the work is largely absent from promotional materials for the program viewed by VOA. They typically show participants working in the service industry, construction, or non-military industrial production. One brochure emphasizes that, after completing Alabuga Start, participants have the opportunity to continue working on a permanent basis, get a job at another Alabuga factory, or enroll in Polytech. It also includes images that appear to show articles by the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal with headlines praising the factory and its salaries. In reality, the images have been edited to conceal the fact that both stories are about military drone production at the facility. That work has placed African women in direct danger. On April 22, a Ukrainian drone crashed into the dormitory where Alabuga Start participants live. A day later, Alabuga Start released a video featuring a Kenyan woman –– one of the program’s public-facing participants –– who said she would be going to work in a cafe. The participant notably said she had come to work and study at Alabuga Polytech — and not Start. 'Those who attacked our hostel today are real barbarians and they deserve serious condemnation,' she said. 'In my opinion, they wanted to intimidate us. But I want to tell you they did not succeed. You won’t scare me, because Alabuga is a strong place and we will get through this.'

Expert: Several African governments unaware of young workers in Russian drone factories	WASHINGTON — They were promised a chance to earn money, get an education abroad, and gain work experience. Instead, they found themselves assembling military drones in Russia and, in one case, subjected to a Ukrainian drone strike. A series of investigative reports has shed light on a Russian labor recruitment program that has allegedly lured young African women to work at an industrial park in provincial Russia with false promises and coerced them into contributing to the Kremlin’s war effort in Ukraine. The reported victims of the program, which attracts recruits largely through online job advertisements, includes women from Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Media reports from The Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and others have exposed the operation, entitled Alabuga Start, but VOA reporting has found that African countries have largely failed to intervene or give an official response.

Australian search and rescue teams arrive in quake-hit Vanuatu	SYDNEY — Australian rescue and medical teams have reached Vanuatu, authorities said on Thursday, where at least 14 people including one French and two Chinese nationals were killed and hundreds were injured in a 7.3 magnitude earthquake two days ago. France's Ambassador Jean-Baptiste Jeangène Vilmer on Thursday confirmed the death of a French national, Vincent Goiset, a resident in Vanuatu who was killed by the rubble of a collapsed building in the city center, he said in a Facebook post. French and Australian rescue teams are searching for survivors at a collapsed building, where eight to 15 people are buried, with some confirmed dead, he wrote. Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said in a report the number of deaths and injuries was expected to increase, as search and rescue continues. A Chinese woman who ran a shop on the ground floor of another collapsed building, a four-story building owned by Chinese company Kenwu Industries, had died, said Michael Mai, who works for the company. She was one of two Chinese nationals the Chinese embassy said were killed in the earthquake, he told Reuters in an interview. 'She was near to the building, very close when it collapsed,' he said. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia would help Vanuatu restore operations at the international airport in the nation's capital of Port Vila, which has been closed to commercial airlines because of damage. 'Additional assistance will be provided where possible, ahead of the airport reopening,' Wong said in a post on X. About 150 Australian citizens returned home overnight on the two aircraft that delivered assistance, Wong said. Other countries have also offered support, with a U.S. military aircraft expected to arrive on Thursday, while France sent a military helicopter with satellite communications and military engineers. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules arrived in Port Vila with rescue equipment and medics on Thursday and will assist with the evacuation of New Zealanders, New Zealand officials said. Another New Zealand military flight had to be diverted on Wednesday evening to New Caledonia due to an engine fire warning and will be repaired on Thursday. Disruptions to power and communication in Vanuatu are hindering rescue efforts, while UNICEF has said water contamination was a major concern.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-search-and-rescue-teams-arrive-in-quake-hit-vanuatu/7906684.html	2024-12-18T19:00:16-08:00	
Blinken: Trump can negotiate to stop Iran from getting nuclear bomb	new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that President-elect Donald Trump had a window to negotiate with Iran, saying the development of a nuclear weapon by Tehran was not inevitable. The outgoing top U.S. diplomat acknowledged that the cleric-run state might be more seriously considering a nuclear weapon after military setbacks in the region. In the last year, Israel's military has hit Iranian air defenses and weakened its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, while rebels have toppled its main Arab ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. 'I don't think that a nuclear weapon is inevitable,' Blinken said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. As 'they've lost different lines of defense, sure, you're going to see more thinking about that,' Blinken said. But the U.S. secretary of state said Iran was aware of the consequences of obtaining a nuclear weapon and added: 'I think there is the prospect of negotiations.' Iran denies pursuing a nuclear weapon, saying its contested nuclear work is for peaceful purposes. In his first term, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that was negotiated under former President Barack Obama and then imposed sweeping sanctions. 'President Trump last time around in pulling out of the deal said that he wanted, as he called it, a better, stronger deal. Fine,' Blinken said. He said that no U.S. administration would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. 'One way or another, I'm convinced that just as our administration had that policy, the next administration will, too,' he said of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration upon taking office in 2021 entered indirect talks with Iran to restore the nuclear deal. Talks collapsed largely over disputes on the scope of U.S. sanctions relief, and Biden has backed pressure on Iran over its support for Palestinian armed group Hamas since its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump's billionaire ally Elon Musk reportedly met with a senior Iranian official following the U.S. election in a bid to encourage calm. Blinken also rejected calls for the United States to work to topple the government of Iran, which has opposed Washington since the overthrow of its U.S.-backed ruler in a popular uprising in 1979. 'I think if we look at the last 20 years, our experiments in regime change have not exactly been resounding successes,' Blinken said. Blinken acknowledged domestic opposition to Iran's current cleric-run state structure, but said it was not 'quite as clear-cut as that.' Opposition is 'reflective of at least half the population, but not the entirety of it,' he said, pointing to differences between cities and rural areas. 'There's a very conservative element in Iran that's significant in number that probably remains beholden to the regime,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-trump-can-negotiate-to-stop-iran-from-getting-nuclear-bomb/7906687.html	2024-12-18T18:52:18-08:00	
New details emerge on Israel’s actions in Syrian buffer zone, change in US position	washington — New details have emerged of Israel’s occupation of a Golan Heights buffer zone since Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad fell from power this month. Assad’s fall also coincided with a change in U.S. language on Israeli activity in the zone from several weeks prior, VOA has learned. A spokesperson for U.N. peacekeeping operations told VOA in a Monday interview that the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has identified at least 10 locations occupied by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the buffer zone as of December 15. The zone, which the United Nations calls an Area of Separation, is on the Syrian side of a 1974 ceasefire line that had divided Israeli and Syrian-administered territory following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Under the ceasefire, the area was intended to separate, or be free of, Syrian and Israeli forces. UNDOF has called Israel’s latest actions in the zone a 'violation' of the ceasefire agreement. The zone is 75 kilometers long, spanning from the peak of Mount Hermon in the north to the Yarmouk River along the Jordanian border in the south. It varies in width from 10 kilometers in the center to just 200 meters in its southern sector. The area is home to 11 Syrian towns and villages, with tens of thousands of residents. Since 1974, UNDOF has monitored Syrian and Israeli ceasefire compliance from around 50 positions inside the zone and just outside it. The U.N. spokesperson said the IDF has severely constrained UNDOF’s freedom of movement between those positions since December 7 but added that Israeli troops’ posture toward UNDOF has 'for the most part not been aggressive.' An IDF spokesman contacted by VOA confirmed it has instructed UNDOF to avoid travel on roads during IDF movements. The U.N. spokesperson also said UNDOF has not observed the IDF building hard-walled accommodations for troops in the locations they have occupied. Rather, images published by the Israeli government showed troops positioned alongside green tents constructed at the summit of Mount Hermon as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the site on Tuesday. UNDOF is aware of Israeli troops installing 'mobility impairment devices,' or barriers, on some roads within the buffer zone, the U.N. spokesperson said. The IDF spokesman confirmed to VOA that the barriers are a security measure intended to slow the approach of unknown vehicles toward Israeli positions. In a Tuesday briefing, the U.N. secretary-general’s spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric, provided more details on how Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone has impacted UNDOF. 'UNDOF used to conduct approximately 55 to 60 daily operational tasks and logistics activities. It is currently restricted to three to five essential logistics movements per day, which significantly affects its operations,' Dujarric said. Netanyahu, in a social media video posted from his visit to the Mount Hermon summit, said the IDF will remain in what he called an important place for Israel’s security 'until another arrangement is found' ensuring that security. Israel has said its occupation of the buffer zone is a temporary measure to prevent Syrian armed groups that ousted Assad from threatening Israeli territory. Retired Israeli Colonel Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, told VOA that Israel’s newly established control of the Mount Hermon summit and of commanding geographical features of the largely abandoned city of Quneitra and areas further south enable the IDF to see deeper into Syrian territory. 'This is crucial for intelligence gathering, both visual and otherwise,' said Lerman, a former deputy national security adviser. In his first public comment on Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone that began eight days earlier, Syria’s main rebel leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, told Britain’s The Times newspaper in a Monday interview that Israel must pull back to its previous positions. 'We are committed to the 1974 agreement. ... We do not want any conflict, whether with Israel or anyone else, and we will not let Syria be used as a launchpad for attacks,' said Sharaa, whose HTS militia is a U.S.-designated terror group. Syrian-born political analyst Rime Allaf, an Austria-based advocate of democracy in her native country, told VOA the new authorities in Syria have been much more focused on rebuilding the country after 13 years of war than on Israel’s expanded control over the Golan Heights. Prior to its occupation of the buffer zone, Israel had spent several months digging a trench along the Golan Heights ceasefire line as part of a nationwide effort to fortify its borders against future terror attacks like that perpetrated by Hamas from Gaza on October 7, 2023. UNDOF had publicly complained to Israel about the trench construction, accusing Israeli forces of straying several meters into the Area of Separation at several points. Responding to a VOA inquiry on November 15, the State Department said it had received the UNDOF complaints of 'unauthorized military personnel and equipment inside the Area of Separation.' It criticized those activities as 'encroachments [that] degrade the security situation.' Three weeks later, after the fall of Assad, U.S. officials changed their language regarding Israeli activities in the buffer zone, defending the Israeli presence as consistent with Israel’s right to self-defense and important for its security. They also said the U.S. continues to support the terms of the 1974 Israeli-Syrian ceasefire agreement and wants to see Syria’s territorial integrity upheld. Asked by VOA if the State Department stood by its earlier criticism of the Israeli trench construction along the ceasefire line, a spokesperson responded on December 12 by pointing to a department press briefing that discussed Israel’s buffer zone activities but not the trench issue specifically. The U.S. recognized the Golan Heights ceasefire line as Israel’s border with Syria in 2019. The rest of the international community has not done so, with most nations labeling the Israeli-administered part of the Golan Heights as occupied Syrian territory. Allaf said many Syrians do not see Israel as having acted in self-defense by occupying the buffer zone. 'I’m on the phone with people in Syria every day, and most of them are outraged about the Golan Heights because nobody has done anything to threaten Israel. They see Israel as acting illegally and opportunistically to expand its territory in a way that creates more tension with Syria,' she said. Lerman said that while Israel’s occupation of the buffer zone may be prolonged as Syria’s new rulers try to form an internationally recognized political entity, he does not anticipate an eventual Israeli annexation of the territory. 'Once there is a legitimate regime in Syria, Israel can trade away the buffer zone for a stable arrangement, perhaps short of a peace deal, that would enable us to concentrate on other missions,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-details-emerge-on-israel-s-actions-in-syrian-buffer-zone-change-in-us-position/7906679.html	2024-12-18T18:33:39-08:00	
Zelenskyy: Ukraine lacks military strength to recover its Russian-occupied land	Ukraine’s president told a French newspaper Wednesday that his country does not have the military might to take back its Russian-occupied territories. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Le Parisien that Ukraine’s military does not possess the strength it needs to expel Russian forces from the Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine that is has held since 2014. Ukraine’s constitution prohibits it from forfeiting its territories, he added. 'We can only count on diplomatic pressure from the international community to force [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to sit down at the negotiating table,' Zelenskyy said. If the West had given Ukraine all the defense systems it needed when Ukraine first asked for them, Ukraine would not be in the situation it is in now with Russia, he said. Russia occupies about 18% of Ukraine. NATO and Ukraine Zelenskyy arrived in Brussels on Wednesday where he met with NATO chief Mark Rutte and other European leaders as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defenses against Russian forces. As Rutte greeted Zelenskyy for their meeting, the NATO secretary-general said he did not want to speak publicly about when the peace talks would begin and if European peacekeepers would be involved because doing so would play into Putin’s hands. Rutte said Wednesday that Ukraine’s partners will do whatever they can to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to defend itself against the nearly three-year war with Russia, including air defense and other weapons system. On Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was in urgent need of military aid, especially air defense systems. 'We must do everything possible to destroy Russia’s ability to wage war from as far away as possible,' he said. 'For this, we need more drones, more modern artillery, and long-range missiles.' Wednesday’s talks come a month before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, bringing uncertainty about the level of continued U.S. support for Ukraine from the new administration. Among those expected to meet with Zelenskyy in Brussels were German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Council President António Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Ahead of the talks, Russia launched another round of overnight aerial attacks. Ihor Taburets, governor of Ukraine’s Cherkasy region, said Wednesday on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 13 drones. He said there was no damage to infrastructure in the area. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces shot down two drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region, along with a drone over Bryansk and another over Kursk. Moscow attack Russia said Wednesday it detained a suspect in the killing of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces. Authorities described the suspect as a citizen of Uzbekistan who was recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services to carry out the Tuesday attack in Moscow. An official with Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, said Tuesday the agency was behind the attack and called Kirillov a 'war criminal and an entirely legitimate target.' Several countries, including Britain and Canada, had sanctioned Kirillov, 54, for his actions in Moscow’s nearly three-year war in Ukraine. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-ukraine-lacks-military-strength-to-recover-its-russian-occupied-land/7906668.html	2024-12-18T18:19:20-08:00	
Expert: North Korea accelerating production, transfer of arms to Russia	UNITED NATIONS — An independent weapons expert told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that North Korea is procuring parts for missiles from third countries and producing and transferring them to Russia faster than previously thought, for use in its war against Ukraine. Jonah Leff, who heads Conflict Armament Research (CAR), an independent organization that tracks weapons used in conflicts, said his researchers documented remnants of four missiles they assess came from North Korea that were recovered in July and August in Ukraine. He said one of the missiles had markings indicating it was produced this year. 'This is the first public evidence of missiles having been produced in North Korea and then used in Ukraine within a matter of months, not years,' Leff said. He said this indicates 'a very short' period between the production of these ballistic missiles, their transfer and eventual use in Ukraine. Leff also noted that some missile remnants had components not manufactured in North Korea, including with production marks as recently as 2023, indicating Pyongyang has a 'robust acquisition network for its ballistic missile program,' despite international sanctions prohibiting such transfers to the rogue regime. 'Despite nearly two decades of sanctions on the DPRK, it has demonstrated this year its ability to produce and supply ballistic missiles for use against Ukraine within just a matter of months,' he said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name. Some parts for North Korean drones and missiles that have been used against Ukraine had components branded from companies in Europe, Japan and the United States. 'Through CAR’s collaborative approach with industry, we have ascertained that these components found in remnants of weapons systems used against Ukraine derived from supplies by third-party distributors, mostly based in East Asia,' Leff said. Russian, North Korean ambassadors Russia’s ambassador did not address the transfer of arms from Pyongyang to the Kremlin. Of their deepening relations, Vassily Nebenzia said they are close neighbors and developing relations in 'all areas.' 'This is our sovereign right. Russian cooperation with the DPRK at the military and other areas is in accordance with international law, not in violation thereof,' Nebenzia said. 'This is not directed against any third countries. It does not pose any threat to states in the region or the international community — and have no doubt, we will continue to develop such cooperation.' North Korea’s ambassador, Song Kim, said their relations are 'a positive contribution to peace and security' and should not be criticized. Wednesday’s meeting was called by the United States, with support from South Korea, Japan and several Western council members. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington has information that 'a large number of DPRK-origin 170 mm long-range self-propelled artillery pieces and 240 mm long-range multiple rocket launchers' are being introduced into the Ukrainian conflict. 'We also have information that Russia has transferred air defense systems to the DPRK,' she said, indicating what Pyongyang may be getting in return for sending both arms and more than 11,000 troops to assist Moscow. 'And not just any soldiers,' she said. 'North Korea sent elite special forces units to Russia.' She noted that this is the first time that North Korean troops have been deployed in large-scale fighting in more than 70 years, and it is the first time outside the Korean Peninsula. Ukraine’s ambassador said Russian forces have integrated North Korean troops into joint units in the Kursk region. 'They primarily advance in large numbers on foot across open terrain, and in extended chains,' Sergiy Kyslytsya said. 'This approach bears a striking resemblance of infantry tactics employed during World War II but is highly unusual for the Russian-Ukrainian war.' He said that the North Korean troops do not appear well-trained in modern warfare. 'Available video evidence reveals that North Korean soldiers seem unprepared to react to enemy drones and lack even the basic understanding of measures to counter drone-related threats,' he said, saying the joint units had suffered 'noticeable losses.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/expert-north-korea-accelerating-production-transfer-of-arms-to-russia-/7906665.html	2024-12-18T18:06:54-08:00	
Amazon workers to strike at US warehouses during busy holiday season	Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday at 6 a.m. EST, in the crucial final days before Christmas, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions. The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company's U.S. facilities, representing about 1% of Amazon's hourly workforce. The strike could disrupt Amazon's operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year. In the New York City area, however, the company has multiple warehouses, as well as smaller delivery depots for fast same-day delivery. Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The union had given Amazon a deadline of Sunday to begin negotiations, and workers voted recently to authorize a possible strike. Teamsters local unions are also putting up primary picket lines at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide, the union said in a statement on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-workers-to-strike-at-us-warehouses-during-busy-holiday-season/7906664.html	2024-12-18T18:00:28-08:00	
Bluesky could become target of foreign disinformation, experts warn	washington — Experts on cybersecurity and online foreign influence campaigns are urging social media company Bluesky, whose app has exploded in popularity in recent weeks, to step up moderation to counter potential state-sponsored influence efforts. Over the past month, Bluesky, a microblogging platform with its roots in Twitter, has seen one of its biggest increases in new user registrations since it was publicly released in February. Over 25 million are now on the platform, close to half of whom joined after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Rose Wang, Bluesky’s chief operating officer, said in a recent interview that Bluesky does not intend to push any political ideologies. 'We have no political viewpoint that we are trying to promote,' she said in early December. Exploiting users’ political leanings Many who joined Bluesky have cited user experience as one of the reasons for migrating from social media platform X. They also have said they joined the platform after Election Day because they are critics of Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump. Some commentators in the U.S. have questioned whether Bluesky is risking becoming an echo chamber of the left. Some experts contend the platform’s liberal-leaning users could be exploited by foreign propagandists. Joe Bodnar, who tracks foreign influence operations for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told VOA Mandarin that Russian propaganda often appeals to the anti-establishment left in the U.S. on contentious topics, like Gaza, gun violence and America’s global dominance. 'The Kremlin wants to make those arguments even louder,' Bodnar said. 'Sometimes that means they play to the left.' So far, at least three accounts that belong to RT, a Russia-controlled media outlet, have joined Bluesky. Sputnik Brazil is also actively posting on the platform. VOA Mandarin found that at least two Chinese accounts that belong to state broadcaster CGTN have joined the platform. Bluesky does not assign verification labels. One way to authenticate an account is for the person or organization to link it to the domain of its official website. There are at least four other accounts that claim to be Chinese state media outlets, including China Daily, the Global Times and People’s Daily. None of the three publications replied to VOA’s emails inquiring about these accounts’ authenticity. Additionally, Beijing has played heavily to the Western left on certain global issues. China has consistently called for a ceasefire in Gaza and blamed the West for supporting Israel. But those familiar with Chinese and Russian state media say the left-leaning user base on Bluesky actually could give Beijing and Moscow a hard time for pushing their narratives. 'Bluesky isn’t the most hospitable place for Russian narratives,' Bodnar said. Sean Haines, a British national who used to work for Chinese state media outlets, shared similar opinions in a recent blog post about Bluesky. 'With its predominately Western liberal leaning, the platform also will be an uphill challenge for those looking to push overtly nationalistic viewpoints,' he wrote. Most of the Chinese and Russian state media accounts have only hundreds of followers, with RT en Espanol at the top, with nearly 7,000. Could 'decentralization' be detrimental? China and Russia have been finding ways to reach the American public through covert disinformation operations on social media. During this year’s election, disinformation campaigns connected to China and Russia promoted claims that cast doubt on the integrity of the voting process. Similar tactics could soon be coming to Bluesky. 'I don’t think Bluesky is more vulnerable to influence campaigns than X or other social networks,' Jennifer Victoria Scurrell, a researcher on AI-supported influence operations, told VOA Mandarin. But Scurrell, of ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies, said Bluesky’s decentralized moderation approach is flawed. Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, started Bluesky as an internal project to give users more power over moderation. Bluesky then went independent in 2021. 'Our mission is to develop and drive large-scale technologies of open and decentralized public conversation,' the company says on its website. To do that, Bluesky 'decentralized' its moderation authority, giving users tools to customize their experience on the site. Bluesky offers a universal basic moderation setting for every user, which labels content such as extremism, misinformation, fake accounts and adult content. Users can choose whether to see the content labeled by Bluesky. Users can report to Bluesky content or accounts they believe have violated Bluesky’s guidelines. On top of that, users get to create their own moderation settings to label or filter out certain content and accounts. Other users can subscribe to these customized settings, should they choose. Scurrell, who helps test security weaknesses for OpenAI as a contractor, told VOA Mandarin the decentralized approach to moderation could be a double-edged sword. 'Societal values are diverse, contextual and local, which makes decentralized moderation an appealing concept,' she wrote in her replies to VOA. She warned that outsourcing content moderation to users, though, 'raises serious concerns' because the approach would give bad actors the same amount of power as normal users. 'What happens if an entire node is taken over by malicious actors spreading disinformation or manipulative content,' she wrote, or 'if the system gets hijacked by an army of bots?' VOA Mandarin emailed Bluesky a list of detailed questions about its moderation policy against potential foreign influence attempts but did not receive a response. Experts have urged Bluesky to implement measures to counter potential foreign influence campaigns. In a recent blog post, Sarah Cook, an independent China watcher and former China director at Freedom House, urged Bluesky to label state media accounts, a practice exercised by many social media companies, so users know of these accounts’ ties to foreign governments. Eugenio Benincasa, an expert on Chinese cyber threats at ETH Zurich, asserts that studying how Chinese tech companies help Beijing surveil social media platforms and manipulate online discussions can help Bluesky better prepare. 'It is crucial to thoroughly study the evolving influence tactics enabled by tools like public opinion monitoring systems to identify vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked or are emerging, in order to develop effective safeguards,' Benincasa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bluesky-could-become-target-of-foreign-disinformation-experts-warn/7906626.html	2024-12-18T16:43:47-08:00	
Trump urges US lawmakers to reject spending bill, raising government shutdown odds	President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday called on U.S. lawmakers to reject a stopgap bill to keep the government funded past Friday, raising the likelihood of a partial shutdown. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance called on lawmakers to pass a different temporary spending bill than the one unveiled on Tuesday, free from what they called 'Democrat giveaways.' Trump also called on lawmakers to use the bill to address the nation's debt ceiling, injecting a new element of complexity into the process. That could complicate efforts to avert a shutdown that would disrupt everything from air travel to law enforcement days before the December 25 Christmas holiday. It would be the first government shutdown since one that extended through December 2018 into 2019, during Trump's first four-year White House term. Democrats currently control the Senate, and Democratic President Joe Biden remains in power until Trump takes office on January 20. The current bill would fund government agencies at current levels and provide $100 billion for disaster relief and $10 billion in farm aid. It also includes a wide range of unrelated provisions, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and a crackdown on hidden hotel fees. Trump and Vance said Congress should limit the bill to temporary spending and disaster relief — and also raise the national debt ceiling, a politically painful task that is scheduled to come to a head next year. 'If Democrats won’t cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration?' they said in the statement. Congress's next steps were unclear. Bipartisan agreement will be needed to pass any spending bill through the House of Representatives, where Republicans have a narrow majority, and the Senate. The stopgap measure is needed because Congress has failed to pass regular spending legislation for the fiscal year that began on October 1. It does not cover benefit programs like Social Security, which continue automatically. The U.S. government has spent more money than it has taken in for more than 20 years, as Democrats have expanded health programs and Republicans have cut taxes, and an aging population is projected to push up the cost of retirement and health programs in the years to come. Steadily mounting debt — currently $36 trillion — will force lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling at some point, either now or when borrowing authority runs out next year. Failure to act could shock bond markets with potentially severe economic consequences. Trump's comments came after his ally Elon Musk pressured Congress to reject the bill and said those who back it should be voted out of office. The Tesla chief executive and world's richest person, who spent more than $250 million to help Trump get elected, has been tasked by Trump to prune the federal budget. Unless Congress acts, the federal government will run out of money to fund operations on Saturday. Negotiators on Tuesday agreed on a deal to extend funding through March 14. House Republicans who helped negotiate the bill said Musk's opposition complicated passage. 'There's never an easy fix to anything around here,' said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole. Democrats said Trump's statement was a sign of chaos ahead. 'House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government. And hurt the working-class Americans they claim to support. You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on social media. Many Republicans already object to additional spending and unrelated provisions that have been added to the package. Trump in the past has sometimes voiced support for government shutdowns, and the 2018-2019 one was the longest in U.S. history, lasting 34 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-urges-us-lawmakers-to-reject-spending-bill-raising-government-shutdown-odds/7906388.html	2024-12-18T16:04:10-08:00	
Pakistan media experienced surge in violence, suppression in 2024	ISLAMABAD — Malik Zafar Iqbal Naich was delivering copies of the newspaper he works for last week when gunmen on a motorbike shot and killed the journalist. Naich, a 45-year-old reporter and newsagent for the Daily Khabrain, became the 12th journalist killed in what has been a deadly year for Pakistan’s media industry. Police are investigating the case in central-eastern Punjab province and have not yet identified a motive. However, the journalist’s employer suspected it could be related to his reporting. 'We demand that the Pakistani authorities ensure justice to the bereaved family,' Blaise Lempen, president of the Press Emblem Campaign, said in a statement. The Geneva-based media safety and rights body says the killings in Pakistan come amid criticism over a lack of justice or impunity for journalists' murders. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has also flagged a failure to ensure accountability. It said that Pakistani authorities should implement urgent measures to curb attacks on media. 'The surge in violence is closely linked to the political turmoil and security situation in the country, but more alarming is the Pakistan government turning a blind eye to the sharp rise in journalist killings,' Beh Lih Yi, the CPJ Asia program coordinator, told VOA. 'This failure to put an end to impunity is sending a chilling message to newsrooms across the country that such heinous acts are tolerated in Pakistan,' she said via email. Alongside violence, journalists are at risk of arrest or threats for covering issues deemed critical or sensitive to authorities, including a crackdown on anti-government protesters. Pakistan’s minister of information, Attaullah Tarar, told VOA he would respond to a request for comment but at the time of publication, no response had been received. Tarar said in September that the government was working closely with provincial authorities to address challenges facing journalists. ‘Deep-rooted impunity’ The Islamabad-based Freedom Network, an advocate for press freedom, has determined that at least half of the journalists killed this year were targeted over their work. 'There is more than one factor contributing to the physical elimination of journalists,' said Iqbal Khattak, the executive director of the nonprofit network. He noted that no one has been held accountable for the killing of journalists to date. 'I think deep-rooted impunity for crimes against journalists and media organizations is encouraging press freedom predators to continue these attacks,' Khattak told VOA. Amir Zia, a political talk show host, said that journalists face threats from multiple fronts, including state actors, political party supporters, religious and sectarian groups, and militants. 'In rural areas, particularly the southern province of Sindh, feudal lords — many affiliated with the provincial ruling party — remain responsible for the murder and torture of journalists,' Zia said. The Sindh government denies the charges. Last month, it announced the establishment of a commission to protect journalists. The panel would provide legal assistance, arrange training and develop safety policies. However, critics remain skeptical about the commission's effectiveness. Most media freedom violations documented by the Freedom Network in 2024 were in Sindh, with Punjab and Islamabad the second- and third-most affected regions, respectively. But Zia said that authorities alone are not responsible for the safety and security of the media. 'Pakistani media organizations hardly take the safety of journalists seriously. There is hardly any training, and an overwhelming number of media persons even lack proper safety gear for covering violence and terrorist incidents,' he said. The CPJ has noted that various parties — from police to tribal chiefs — often pressure relatives, particularly those from rural areas, to abandon efforts to secure justice, with families in some cases paid in exchange for silence. Legal threats Watchdogs, too, have long criticized Pakistan for the poor media freedom environment, including laws that target media, arrests, accusations of torture and harassment. Coverage of protests last month led to one journalist being detained briefly and another called in for questioning. Harmeet Singh, a journalist from the country’s minority Sikh community, has been summoned to appear for questioning by the Federal Investigation Agency Cybercrime Center next week. The anchor for Such TV faces allegations of propagating a 'misleading, concocted and baseless campaign against state institutions and security agencies of Pakistan.' The case stems from Singh’s coverage of a Nov. 26 opposition protest march in Islamabad by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Pakistani security forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition on protesters, according to local and foreign media. The PTI reported the deaths of at least 12 people and said that many more are still unaccounted for. The government refuted any casualties resulting from gunfire, saying that security forces were not armed with 'lethal' weapons. 'The targeting of Singh is part of a broader pattern of intimidation against journalists in Pakistan,' said CPJ’s Beh. She added that a second journalist — Matiullah Jan — was arrested on terrorism charges for his coverage of the same protest. Hours before he was detained at a hospital last month, Jan had said on his TV show that security forces used firearms to disperse protesters. He cited data from hospital sources and accused the government of pressuring hospital staff not to reveal details to the media. 'Truth is always the first casualty of war,' Jan told VOA, saying he believes his arrest was meant to deter journalists from investigating the protest. The reporter, who runs a YouTube channel with nearly 400,000 subscribers, added, '[Authorities] only care about some temporary arrangement to prevent journalists from completing their work, completing their job and bringing out facts, so that’s their ultimate success.' The arrests and violence contribute to Pakistan’s low ranking for media freedom. The country ranks 152 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. And it has appeared every year on the CPJ Impunity Index that looks at countries where justice for killed journalists remains elusive. In the latest index, published Oct. 30, Pakistan was ranked 12th for countries failing to hold killers in media cases to account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-media-experienced-surge-in-violence-suppression-in-2024/7906338.html	2024-12-18T14:39:48-08:00	
NATO chief aims to put Ukraine in position of strength for peace talks with Russia	BRUSSELS — NATO's secretary-general said he wants to discuss ways to put Ukraine in a position of strength for any future peace talks with Russia during a meeting Wednesday with Ukraine’s president and a small number of European leaders. But Mark Rutte appeared frustrated at growing speculation in NATO capitals about when those peace talks might start and whether European peacekeepers would be involved, saying that speaking publicly about it plays into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'High on the agenda is to make sure that the president, his team in Ukraine, are in the best possible position one day when they decide to start the peace talks,' Rutte told reporters as he welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his residence in Brussels. The focus, Rutte said, must be 'to do everything now to make sure that when it comes to air defense, when it comes to other weapons systems, that we make sure that we provide whatever we can.' He said that another issue up for discussion would be 'how to make sure that when peace comes one day that we also think about the economy of Ukraine now, but also after a future peace deal.' Zelenskyy posted on Telegram that he would hold talks with the leaders of the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland and U.K. representatives, who were in Brussels. He’s also due to take part in an EU summit in the Belgian capital on Thursday. Zelenskyy said that the meeting would provide 'a very good opportunity to speak about security guarantees for Ukraine, for today and for tomorrow.' Ukraine sees NATO membership as the ultimate security guarantee, but the U.S. and Germany lead a group of countries that oppose this while war continues. After separate talks with Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron said his country is making reinforced support for Ukraine its ″absolute priority″ and will continue giving Ukraine ″the means to defend itself and to make Russia’s war of aggression fail,″ according to Macron’s office. Noting his recent meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, Macron said he will maintain a ″tight dialogue with Ukraine and its international partners to work for a return to a fair and lasting peace,″ the statement said. At NATO headquarters earlier, Rutte had said the terms of any peace talks should be up to Ukraine, Russia and any others at the negotiating table. 'If we now start to discuss amongst ourselves what a deal could look like, we make it so easy for the Russians,' he said. 'I think we would be very wise to put some lid on this and focus on the business at hand, and the business at hand is to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to prevent Putin from winning,' Rutte added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-chief-aims-to-put-ukraine-in-position-of-strength-for-peace-talks-with-russia/7906333.html	2024-12-18T14:10:33-08:00	
More than 2 million Nigerians kidnapped in one year, survey finds	Abuja, Nigeria — Security officials in Nigeria are raising concerns after a National Bureau of Statistics survey revealed that more than 2 million people were kidnapped in the West African nation between May 2023 and April 2024, and that Nigerians paid a cumulative $1.42 billion to kidnappers within the same period. The NBS released its Crime Experience and Security Perception Survey 2024 on Tuesday. The report said some 600,000 Nigerians were killed and 2.2 million others abducted across the country between May 2023 and April 2024. Armed gangs, known locally as bandits, were mostly responsible for the escalation of violence in northwest and north central Nigeria, while terror-related violence was reported in the northeast region of Nigeria. The report said 91% of the kidnappings were attributed to ransom demands, while other cases were due to political, criminal or terrorist motives. It also said Nigerians spent $1.4 billion cumulatively to free their loved ones from kidnappers at an average of $1,700 per incident. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said the report is no surprise. 'The figure is not surprising. The only difference is that the media focus has shifted, and that's what makes it look as if it [insecurity] has reduced,' Iroegbu said. 'So, this report has brought back to light what is going on.' According to the NBS report, 82.1% of the kidnapped victims were released, 12.8% were killed, 3.3% remained in captivity and the outcome of about 1.3% of victims was unknown. The report comes amid growing security concerns in Africa's most populous nation already struggling to curb a range of insecurities that have stretched the security forces thin. It also revealed that nearly seven out of 10 households in Nigeria reported murder cases to the police within the same period. Security analyst Saheed Shehu said the trend is worrying. 'These figures should serve as a yardstick as a baseline for the president and commander-in-chief to hold his military, police, accountable,' Shehu said. 'The figures should serve as a tool to hold the leaders of the security agencies accountable. We should not just be reading figures and then wait for the end of 2025 to release another figure.' In November, Nigeria announced the discovery of a new terror group known as Lakurawa but said security forces were already on their trail. Two weeks ago, Nigerian defense authorities said the military killed a total of 8,000 terrorists and apprehended over 11,000 suspects and rescued over 6,000 victims between January and December. But Shehu is skeptical. 'This report coming from the National Bureau of Statistics — to be honest, it makes me to be at a quandary whether the reports we're getting from security agencies of successes ... it does not balance with this report,' Shehu said. 'So, something must be wrong somewhere.' Improving security is a major challenge for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's government as it desperately seeks to attract foreign investments to grow the country's struggling economy. Nigeria allocated about $4 billion, or 12% of this year's budget, to defense and security — the largest single allocation to any sector.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-2-million-nigerians-kidnapped-in-one-year-survey-finds/7906304.html	2024-12-18T13:36:04-08:00	
South Sudan set to hold elections in 2026, but will it be ready?	JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — South Sudan is due to hold long-delayed general elections in December 2026, and some wonder if the world’s youngest nation will be ready. The vote was set for this month but was delayed for a number of reasons, including the need for more time to complete a census, draft a permanent constitution and register political parties. The postponement, first announced in June, extended the term of the current transitional government, headed by President Salva Kiir. Abendengo Akok, head of South Sudan’s National Electoral Commission, told VOA that the political will must be present for the vote to be successful, using as an example the 2018 peace agreement that ended the country’s civil war. 'If we are serious, two years are enough for us to run the election,' Akok said, adding that adequate funding is necessary for a successful vote. Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, warned last week that mismanaged elections could reignite violence and upset South Sudan’s stability. 'We have been insisting that properly prepared elections, which have also been preceded by proper trust-building exercises, can play a significant role in taking an exercise which can be very divisive and make it a nation-building exercise,' he said. People coming together to vote, he said, will help them recognize that 'together they control the future of South Sudan.' South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The country was set to hold its maiden election in 2015, but civil war broke out in 2013. Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar, Kiir’s former vice president, were locked in a power struggle, triggering fighting between forces loyal to each man. In 2018, Kiir and Machar signed the comprehensive peace agreement, which was to culminate in elections this month. In June, however, Kiir and Machar agreed to push the election out another two years. Wani Yusuf was 14 years old when he cast his vote in the referendum to secede from Sudan. Now he looks forward to casting his first vote as an adult and believes he will make an informed and independent decision in helping choose South Sudan’s first democratically elected government. Yusuf, however, questioned whether the 2026 vote will materialize. 'When you look at the period that we spend postponing the election, it still tells you that that if they cannot conduct election in that time up to now, then there is also high possibility that election might not take place within those two years’ time,' he said. Apart from budgetary constraints, the electoral commission still needs to conduct a census and draw up guidelines, which will take up to 17 months, according to the document outlining the delay in the vote. These processes have not started because of a lack of a budget, according to Gabriel Deng, the electoral commission’s deputy chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-set-to-hold-elections-in-2026-but-will-it-be-ready/7906296.html	2024-12-18T13:32:13-08:00	
Thailand joins other Asia nations in battle against cheap Chinese imports	Bangkok — For many countries in Southeast Asia, Chinese investment and tourism are key to their economies. However, cheap low-quality Chinese products that are flooding markets across the region are also raising concerns about how they are undercutting local businesses, experts say. That is forcing countries like Thailand to find ways to combat onslaught of low-priced goods. Last year, bilateral trade between Thailand and China was more than $126 billion, with direct Chinese foreign investment heavily contributing to the Thai economy. Three of Thailand’s main economic industries are manufacturing, agriculture and services. But manufacturing has seen a decline, with 2,000 factories closing in 2023, leading to thousands of jobs lost, according to data from the Department of Industrial Works. Business owners have long bemoaned the fact that low-quality Chinese goods are undercutting local Thai businesses. Bobae Shopping Mall – a retail and wholesale market in Bangkok – is one of the places where that impact is showing. With seven floors dedicated to shopping units, many have their shutters down, even though Thailand is in its peak season and Christmas is next week. Banchob Pianphanitporn is the owner of Ben’s Socks, which is located on the fifth floor. He has owned the business for 26 years and manages four units. He has one factory in Thailand that employs 24 staff in total. He said that over the last decade, his sales have dropped by half because of Chinese imports. 'I would say [sales are] 50% down since 10 years ago,' he told VOA. 'I sell socks for 150 baht ($4.38) per a dozen, but if this was a Chinese product, they would sell at 85 baht ($2.48). If [customers] have low budget they will say [my socks] are expensive. They don’t consider the materials, [my socks] are much better material and more flexible,' he added. Thailand’s slow manufacturing industry has contributed to a sluggish year for the economy. Forecasts project that Thailand’s economic will grow by 2.3% – 2.8% percent in 2024, which is less than its regional neighbors. Although the Bank of Thailand forecasts a 3% growth in 2025, concerns from business owners remain. Banchob points to several closures of units in his mall, blaming Thailand’s economy. But in an effort to remain open, he promotes his business on social media to attract more customers. 'Social media is a must. I’m on TikTok; I make much content. I have to work harder to tell people I’m still alive; Ben Sock’s made in Thailand is here,' he added. According to Thai government spokesperson Sasikarn Wattanachan, there has been a 20 percent decrease in low-quality imports in Thailand since July. Authorities have introduced tighter inspections of cheap imports, focusing on agricultural, consumer and industrial items. Thailand has also added a 7% value added tax on goods imported that are under 1,500 baht or $43.77, the Bangkok Post has reported. But for other sellers and store owners, they don’t see any difference. Pam, a seller at Pretty Baby, a baby clothes store in the Bangkok mall, says the seemingly unlimited stock from Chinese manufacturers has affected sales. Pam did not want to disclose her full name fearing retaliation for speaking with the press. '[Chinese products] are selling a lot, but we don’t have that much stock. The government still allows the products from overseas. Our sales have dropped down a little bit,' she told VOA. For some customers, retaining regular customers is key to beating cheaper alternatives. Prang is part-owner of V.C. shop, a clothing store which specializes in loose-fitting clothing known as elephant pants. 'The hard advertising from Chinese people [on social media] has had a big effect,' she told VOA. Prang too did not want to give her full name. 'Pants can sell here for 70 baht ($2.04) but Chinese sell for 50 baht ($1.46). In the past we can tell [the difference] between Thai and China products, now China copies look 99 percent the same. We cannot fight with the costs, but we are confident on our material and quality, and we can keep our customers,' she added. It’s not just Thailand that is trying to reduce low-quality imports. A growing number of countries across Asia are looking for ways to protect local manufacturers and trade. In India, a proposed temporary tax of 25% on steel imports is likely to be imposed to curb cheaper alternatives from China and boost production from Indian manufacturers, the Reuters news agency reported on December 17. And in Indonesia, protests against Chinese imports have prompted Jakarta to propose a 200% tariff on certain imported clothing and ceramic goods, to protect small and medium enterprises. Vietnam also relies heavily on China in trade. Beijing is Hanoi’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to more than $171 billion in 2023. Although both governments share communist ideologies and a 1,287-kilometer land border, Vietnam is also acting to combat China's cheap imports. In late November, Hanoi banned Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu after the two companies failed to meet a business registration deadline with the Vietnamese government. But local businesses in Vietnam have long voiced concern over discounted products and the sale of counterfeit items from the retailer. 'Cheap Chinese imports from platforms like Shein and Temu are flooding Vietnam’s markets, squeezing local producers and sparking outrage over unfair competition,' Nguyen Khac Giang, Visiting Fellow at ISEAS, told VOA. 'In response the government is cracking down by scrapping VAT exemptions, tightening oversight, and banning platforms which do not register in Vietnam. It’s a bold move to rein in Chinese e-commerce giants and defend local businesses, but I think the fight is far from over,' he added. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics, says both Thailand and Vietnam may also have another motive. 'China produces on an economy of scale that no one in Southeast Asia can, their productions costs are lower for most products. I think what you see Thailand and Vietnam doing now is trying to court Chinese investment for local production, to create local product ecosystems. But neither is willing to take China head on and accuse them of unfair trading practices,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-joins-other-asia-nations-in-battle-against-cheap-chinese-imports/7906265.html	2024-12-18T13:29:29-08:00	
Manhattan man pleads guilty to helping establish secret Chinese police station in New York City	NEW YORK — A Manhattan resident has pleaded guilty to helping establish a secret police station in New York City on behalf of the Chinese government. Chen Jinping, 60, entered the guilty plea on a single count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday. Matthew Olsen, an assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department, said Chen admitted in court to his role in 'audaciously establishing an undeclared police station' in Manhattan and attempting to conceal the effort when approached by the FBI. 'This illegal police station was not opened in the interest of public safety, but to further the nefarious and repressive aims of the PRC in direct violation of American sovereignty,' he said in statement, referring to the People's Republic of China. Prosecutors say Chen and his co-defendant, Lu Jianwang, opened and operated a local branch of China’s Ministry of Public Security in Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood starting in early 2022. The office, which occupied an entire floor of the building, performed basic services, such as helping Chinese citizens renew their Chinese driver’s licenses, but also identified pro-democracy activists living in the U.S., according to federal authorities. The clandestine Chinese police operation was shuttered in fall 2022 amid an FBI investigation. But in an apparent effort to obstruct the federal probe, Chen and Lu deleted from their phones the communications with a Chinese government official they reported to, prosecutors said. China is believed to be operating such secretive police outposts in North America, Europe and other places where there are Chinese communities. The country, however, has denied that they are police stations, saying that they exist mainly to provide citizen services such as renewing driver’s licenses. The arrest of Chen and Lu in April 2023 was part of a series of Justice Department prosecutions aimed at cracking down on 'transnational repression,' in which foreign governments such as China work to identify, intimidate and silence dissidents in the U.S. Lawyers for Chen and Lu didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Chen faces up to five years in prison at his sentencing on May 30. Lu, who is due back in court in February, had a longstanding relationship with Chinese law enforcement officials, according to prosecutors. Over the years, they say, the Bronx resident, who was also known as Harry Lu, helped harass and threaten a Chinese fugitive living in the U.S. and also worked to locate a pro-democracy activist in California on behalf of China’s government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/manhattan-man-pleads-guilty-to-helping-establish-secret-chinese-police-station-in-new-york-city-/7906257.html	2024-12-18T13:23:16-08:00	
Sanctioned by China, Rubio confident in engaging Beijing as US top diplomat	STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a 'substantive' face-to-face meeting Wednesday morning with Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been selected by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee for the next U.S. secretary of state. The meeting comes as Trump’s team prepares for the transition process. 'It was a good, constructive and substantive conversation,' State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing. 'We continue to stand ready to help support a seamless transition on January 20,' he added. In August 2020, China sanctioned Rubio, a longtime critic of the government in Beijing, along with others, citing what it described as 'egregious behavior' related to 'Hong Kong-related issues.' Rubio told VOA earlier in December that he is confident in his ability 'to find some solution' to engage with Beijing if confirmed. When asked if he would maintain his previous stance on foreign policy issues, Rubio said, 'The president sets foreign policy, and our job at the State [Department] will be to execute it.' Here is a look at Rubio’s past legislative actions and public statements on key China-related issues: Securing US technologies Rubio has warned that 'Communist China is the most powerful adversary the United States has faced in living memory,' in a September report titled 'The World China Made.' The report asserts that the Chinese Communist Party controls the world’s largest industrial base through 'market-distorting subsidies' and 'rampant theft.' Rubio urged a 'whole-of-society effort' by U.S. lawmakers, CEOs, and investors to 'rebuild our country, overcome the China challenge, and keep the torch of freedom lit for generations to come.' Rubio has been a vocal critic of U.S.-China research collaborations, warning that taxpayer funds have unknowingly supported Chinese military-linked experiments in areas like stealth technology, semiconductors, and cybersecurity — potentially giving Beijing a strategic edge. In July, he introduced a bill to fortify U.S. research, with key provisions including the creation of a 'TRUST' database to track high-risk Chinese research entities, stricter grant application transparency, and penalties for undisclosed foreign funding. The bill also enhances visa screening for individuals linked to adversarial foreign research and mandates stronger oversight of U.S.-China research partnerships. Rubio has advocated for the bipartisan 2021 Secure Equipment Act, a law that prohibits the U.S. government from issuing new equipment licenses to Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE that the United States and other Western countries have deemed a national security risk. Revoking China’s ‘most favored nation’ status Rubio is among the Republican lawmakers who proposed a bill to revoke China's Permanent Normal Trade Relations, or PNTR, with the United States. Commonly known as 'most favored nation' status, PNTR means that Chinese goods being imported into the United States are granted the most advantageous terms that the country offers when it applies tariffs and other restrictions. Introduced in September 2024, the Neither Permanent Nor Normal Trade Relations Act marks a shift toward a more protectionist U.S. trade strategy. The bill aims to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports, strengthen supply chain resilience, and reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese goods. One of the key provisions includes the establishment of a trust fund using tariff revenue to compensate U.S. industries harmed by China's retaliatory trade actions, with priority support for agriculture, semiconductor, and aerospace sectors. Rubio outlined his position as early as a 2022 speech at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, calling the belief that free trade and globalization would change China 'the single biggest geopolitical blunder of the last quarter century.' 'For over two decades, China methodically undermined our economic strength by stealing our critical technology, our manufacturing capacity, and our jobs,' he argued. Monitoring China's human rights record Rubio also chaired the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, CECC, from 2017 to 2019 and continues to serve as a commissioner. The CECC was established in 2000 in response to concerns that granting PNTR to China would eliminate Congress's ability to annually review and debate China's human rights record. The commission monitors China’s compliance with international human rights standards and maintains a list of victims of human rights abuses. Rubio has criticized China’s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, introduced bills to ban imports linked to forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and expanded sanctions on Uyghur human rights abusers. The Florida senator has also supported U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and efforts to enhance its global standing. He has met with Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists and has been a staunch advocate for their movement. He introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed into law in 2019. Rubio also headed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, signed into law in 2020, which imposed sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. With the law's sanctions set to expire in 2025, Rubio introduced the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Reauthorization Act of 2024 in June, sponsored by CECC co-chair Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, to extend key provisions for another five years, ensuring continued U.S. support for the human rights of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China. On April 10, 2024, Rubio and Merkley introduced a resolution reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's vibrant democracy and recognizing the 45th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act – a landmark U.S. public law that has guided U.S.-Taiwan relations since 1979. The TRA, as it is called, outlines U.S. policy to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and commits Washington to provide Taipei with the capacity to resist coercion or force that could threaten its security or economic system. Rubio has been a vocal critic of China’s increasing economic, military, and political coercion against Taiwan. He has introduced bills aimed at bolstering deterrence in the Taiwan Strait and led legislation to facilitate visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials, such as the Taiwan Travel Act, which President Trump signed into law in 2018. The law is considered a substantial upgrade to U.S.-Taiwan relations, as it removed previous restrictions on travel for officials. The Communist Party-led People’s Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. China has not ruled out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sanctioned-by-china-rubio-confident-in-engaging-beijing-as-us-top-diplomat-/7906276.html	2024-12-18T13:19:07-08:00	
Pakistani village grapples with loss after migrant boat capsizes off Greece	Washington — 'Ehtisham was the darling of the family. He was very fond of cricket. His only obsession was that one day he would go to Europe and poverty would end at home.' This is a statement from Fazlur Rehman, a close relative of 35-year-old Ehtisham Anjum, who went missing after a migrant boat he was in capsized in Greek territorial waters on Saturday. According to locals, 10 of the passengers, including Anjum, were from Helaan, a village in Pakistan’s central Punjab province. The initial list of 47 survivors released by the Pakistani embassy in Greece does not include Anjum’s name. But the family is holding out hope that he is still alive. However, according to Pakistan embassy in Greece, the rescue operation for the missing has been called off by the Greek authorities. According to the embassy in Athens, three boats carrying 175 illegal migrants of different nationalities including Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Egyptians and Sudanese crew members, capsized off the Greek coast. While all the passengers on two of the boats were rescued, only 39 out of 83 have been rescued from the third. Several teens were on board and at least one 12-year-old Pakistani was among the passengers. In a video shared with VOA, several Pakistanis give the details of their perilous journey and the poor condition of the boats ferrying them to Greece from Tobruk, Libya. One survivor of the boat that capsized said the sea was rough, and the boat was small and not in good working condition. Despite that, he said, the smugglers put many people on board, way over the boat’s capacity. That man and another said the boat hit a coast guard ship or cargo ship before it capsized. They said they were in the water for an hour and a half before being rescued. Last year more than 350 Pakistanis lost their lives when an overcrowded boat carrying hundreds of illegal migrants sank en route to Greece from Tobruk, Libya. According to Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights, Pakistan, 'in the year 2023 alone over 6,000 Pakistanis undertook illegal journeys to reach European shores' -- though some estimates put the number significantly higher. A report released by the commission in May of this year said most of the illegal migrants were motivated by economic concerns. Human smugglers are a big part of this journey and one of the locals in Helaan village told VOA’s Urdu service that a local agent had asked for the equivalent of $14,380 each from the clients to get them to Europe. The agent went missing after the news of the accident. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency intensified its crackdown on human smugglers in the wake of the tragedy off Greece last year. In 2023, 189 cases were registered, leading to 854 arrests. Fazlur Rehman, the relative of Ehtisham Anjum, says four youngsters from the same village died four years ago while trying to get to Europe illegally. He adds that people are becoming greedier and will soon forget the dangers involved. This story originated in VOA’s Urdu Service, with Ehtisham Shami and Ishraq Nazir contributing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-village-grapples-with-loss-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-off-greece/7906247.html	2024-12-18T13:14:51-08:00

US Federal Reserve cuts key loan rate by quarter-point	WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter-point — its third cut this year — but also signaled that it expects to reduce rates more slowly next year than it previously envisioned, largely because of still-elevated inflation. The Fed’s 19 policymakers projected that they would cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point just twice in 2025, down from their estimate in September of four rate cuts. Their new projections suggest that consumers may not enjoy much lower rates next year for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing. Fed officials have underscored that they are slowing their rate reductions as their benchmark rate nears a level that policymakers refer to as 'neutral' — the level that is thought to neither spur nor hinder the economy. Wednesday's projections suggest that the policymakers may think they are not very far from that level. Their benchmark rate stands at 4.3% after Wednesday’s move, which followed a steep half-point reduction in September and a quarter-point cut last month. This year’s Fed rate reductions have marked a reversal after more than two years of high rates, which largely helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers. Balancing inflation and unemployment But now, the Fed is facing a variety of challenges as it seeks to complete a 'soft landing' for the economy, whereby high rates manage to curb inflation without causing a recession. Chief among them is that inflation remains sticky: According to the Fed’s preferred gauge, annual 'core' inflation, which excludes the most volatile categories, was 2.8% in October. That is still persistently above the central bank’s 2% target. At the same time, the economy is growing briskly, which suggests that higher rates haven’t much restrained the economy. As a result, some economists — and some Fed officials — have argued that borrowing rates shouldn’t be reduced much more for fear of overheating the economy and re-igniting inflation. On the other hand, the pace of hiring has cooled significantly since 2024 began, a potential worry because one of the Fed’s mandates is to achieve maximum employment. The unemployment rate, while still low at 4.2%, has risen nearly a full percentage point in the past two years. Concern over rising unemployment contributed to the Fed’s decision in September to cut its key rate by a larger-than-usual half point. On top of that, President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a range of tax cuts — on Social Security benefits, tipped income and overtime income — as well as a scaling-back of regulations. Collectively, these moves could stimulate growth. At the same time, Trump has threatened to impose a variety of tariffs and to seek mass deportations of migrants, which could accelerate inflation. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have said they won’t be able to assess how Trump’s policies might affect the economy or their own rate decisions until more details are made available and it becomes clearer how likely it is that the president-elect’s proposals will be enacted. Until then, the outcome of the presidential election has mostly heightened the uncertainty surrounding the economy. 'I’ve got the least amount of conviction about what will happen with the economy over the next 12 months than I’ve had in years,' said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale. 'This is going to be a work in progress as things evolve.' Projections for 2025 Such uncertainty was underscored by the quarterly economic projections the Fed issued Wednesday. The policymakers now expect overall inflation, as measured by their preferred gauge, to rise slightly from 2.3% now to 2.5% by the end of 2025. Inflation by their measure is now far below its peak of 7.2% in June 2022. Even so, the prospect of slightly higher inflation makes it harder for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs because high interest rates are its principal weapon against inflation. The officials also expect the unemployment rate to inch up by the end of next year, from 4.2% now to a still-low 4.3%. That slight increase might not be enough, by itself, to justify many more rate cuts. Most other central banks around the world are also cutting their benchmark rates. Last week, the European Central Bank lowered its key rate for the fourth time this year to 3% from 3.25%, as inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro has fallen to 2.3% from a peak of 10.6% in late 2022. The Bank of Canada also cut its rate by a quarter-point last week, as did the Bank of England last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-loan-rate-by-quarter-point/7906218.html	2024-12-18T12:30:09-08:00	
Future uncertain for Syria's Kurds amid potential Turkish offensive	Turkey is chief among local, regional and global powers seeking to fill the power vacuum following the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Ankara is poised to be one of the biggest winners in post-Assad Syria. Despite being in a military alliance with the United States via the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Turkey’s main target in Syria is also the United States’ ally in the country — the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. For years, the SDF has worked with U.S. forces to fight Islamic State in Syria’s northeast, defeating IS in its final holdout, Baghuz, near Syria’s Iraqi border, in March 2019. Roughly 900 U.S. troops are deployed alongside Kurdish-led forces to keep IS from reestablishing a geographical foothold, and the Kurds oversee prisons housing thousands of IS fighters and their families. Yet, Turkey views the People's Defense Units, or YPG, which make up most of the SDF’s fighting force, as an extension of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The PKK has been engaged in an insurgency in southeast Turkey for decades, sometimes resorting to violence in its pursuit of more autonomy and rights for ethnic Kurds. Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union all view the PKK as a terrorist organization. The SDF does not deny its connections to the PKK but has said it will not engage in terror attacks on Turkish soil. On Dec. 15, Turkish National Defense Minister Yasar Guler called dismantling Kurdish forces Ankara’s 'primary issue in Syria.' 'We have expressed this to our American friends. We expect them to reassess their position [on support for the Kurds],' Guler said. That echoed earlier comment from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who on Dec. 10 said the fight against Kurdish forces in Syria, 'which threatens the security and perpetuity of both countries, will continue without any concession.' Uncertain US support for Kurds During a press conference in Aqaba, Jordan, on Dec. 14, a BBC journalist asked U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken what degree of Kurdish autonomy in Syria was acceptable to Washington. Blinken was noncommittal, saying Syria’s organization and the formation of a new state are 'decisions for Syrians to make.' Blinken said he had discussed with Turkey the importance of allowing Kurdish forces to continue fighting IS during a time of vulnerability, as Syria is in a state of transition. Ankara has responded by amassing troops on its border with Syria, with a senior U.S. official telling The Wall Street Journal on Dec. 17 that Turkey could attack Kurdish forces within hours or days. As Turkey potentially prepares for a broader assault, the future of U.S. support for the Kurds remains unclear. On Dec. 16, President-elect Donald Trump characterized the ouster of Assad as an 'unfriendly takeover' by Turkey. But during his first term, Trump sought to withdraw U.S. forces supporting the Kurds in 2018 and 2019. In November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trumps’s pick for health secretary, said Trump wanted to remove U.S. troops from northern Syria, and not leave them there as 'cannon fodder' if fighting erupted between Turkish and Kurdish forces. Kurds 'stand to lose the most' While analysts view Turkey as one of the primary benefactors of the collapsed Assad regime, the Kurds 'stand to lose the most,' from their autonomy to the security of their communities, Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, told France 24 on Dec. 5. After Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011, Kurdish forces declared autonomy over parts of northeastern Syria in November 2103, where they form a majority. An estimated 30 million Kurds are spread across northern Iraq, western Iran, northern Syria, and make up roughly 18% of Turkey’s population. The largest ethnic group without a homeland, Kurds have long faced persecution in Syria and elsewhere. Turkey, which shares a nearly 900-kilometer border with Syria, was a long-standing opponent of the Assad regime, and a primary supporter of armed groups there, including Sunni jihadist factions. Turkey also took in roughly 3.6 million Syrian refugees, which became a source of domestic disquiet. Since 2016, Turkey has launched multiple military operations in Syria targeting the Kurds with the goal of preventing an autonomous Kurdish region being established on its border. In 2019, Turkey tried and failed to create a 30-kilometer buffer zone along its border with Syria. For years, Erdogan has signaled that his plans to establish that defensive area remain in place. Immediately after the ouster of Assad, Turkish-backed fighters swept in to take territory under SDF control as part of that plan. Syrian National Army While insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a powerful Islamist faction, were instrumental in bringing down the Assad regime, another group with ties to Turkey — the Syrian National Army, or SNA, played a key role in that fight and will prove pivotal in shaping Syria’s future. The Turkey-backed Syrian Interim Government, an alternative government in Syria, helped establish the SNA in 2017 as part of efforts to consolidate the anti-Assad resistance. The SNA, which is trained, equipped and funded by Turkey, helped HTS recapture Syria’s second-largest city, Aleppo, from regime forces in early December. SNA is in lockstep with Ankara in its bid to crush any prospects of Kurdish autonomy in Syria. The SNA took part in Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. Guler, the Turkish defense minister, said the YPG will be eliminated in Syria sooner or later, adding 'we and the new administration in Syria want this.' He also claimed Turkey’s problem was 'exclusively with terrorists,' and not 'our Kurdish brothers living in Iraq and Syria.' However, the United Nations, the U.S. and other Western governments also consider HTS to be a terrorist group, while acknowledging that they appear to have moderated their positions in recent years. Some groups within the SNA likewise adhere to extremist ideologies and have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for committing grave human rights abuses in northern Syria. That has not stopped Turkey from promising aid, including military support, to the rebel-led transitional government. Despite those and other allegations leveled at Turkish and Turkish-backed forces, Erdogan on Dec. 10 claimed that Turkey has strictly observed international law 'from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/future-uncertain-for-syria-kurds-amid-potential-turkish-offensive/7906014.html	2024-12-18T11:56:45-08:00	
US cyber watchdog seeks switch to encrypted apps following 'Salt Typhoon' hacks	WASHINGTON — The U.S. cybersecurity watchdog CISA is telling senior American government officials and politicians to immediately switch to end-to-end encrypted messaging following intrusions at major American telecoms blamed on Chinese hackers. In written guidance released on Wednesday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said 'individuals who are in senior government or senior political positions' should 'immediately review and apply' a series of best practices around the use of mobile devices. The first recommendation: 'Use only end-to-end encrypted communications.' End-to-end encryption — a data protection technique that aims to make data unreadable by anyone except its sender and its recipient — is baked into various chat apps, including Meta Platforms' WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, and the privacy-focused app Signal. Corporate offerings, which allow end-to-end encryption, also include Microsoft's Teams and Zoom Communications' meetings. CISA's message is the latest in a series of increasingly stark warnings issued by American officials in the wake of dramatic hacks of U.S. telecom companies by a group dubbed 'Salt Typhoon.' Last week, Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan said, 'this attack likely represents the largest telecommunications hack in our nation's history.' U.S. officials have blamed China for the hacking. Beijing routinely denies allegations of cyberespionage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cyber-watchdog-seeks-switch-to-encrypted-apps-following-salt-typhoon-hacks-/7906048.html	2024-12-18T11:30:49-08:00	
Bird flu spillover to other species poses global health threat, experts warn	GENEVA — International human and animal health experts warn the H5N1 avian influenza is evolving quickly and posing a global health threat as the virus is increasingly crossing species barriers and infecting a wide range of domestic and wild mammals. 'These developments pose significant challenges to animal, human and environmental health,' Dr. Gregorio Torres, veterinarian and head of the science department at the World Organization for Animal Health, told journalists in Geneva Tuesday. He noted that avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has been reported in 108 countries and territories over five continents in the last three years. 'And as of December 2024, the infection has been detected in over 70 species of domestic and wild mammals. This includes the ongoing detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle in the United States,' Torres said. 'So far, the close monitoring of the virus has not found markers that could suggest effective mammalian adaptation, but we know this can change at any time,' he said. Most human cases in US The World Health Organization this week reported 76 people were infected with the H5 avian influenza viruses in 2024, most of them among farm workers. Sixty-one of these cases occurred in the United States, which has reported outbreaks in wildlife, poultry and, more recently, dairy cattle. 'This is the first time we have seen the infections from dairy cattle to humans, and so many within the U.S.' said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, director of epidemic and pandemic threat management at WHO. 'In the U.S., all but two have direct links with infected animals, whether this was working on farms, whether this was part of culling exercises,' she said. 'We have not seen any detection of human-to-human transmission among these cases.' While much attention on the bird flu situation has focused on the United States this year, Van Kerkhove noted that Australia, Cambodia, Canada, China and Vietnam also reported outbreaks. Based on available information, she said that the H5N1 viruses have remained avian viruses and have not adapted to spread among people, stressing that follow-up epidemiologic, virologic and serologic investigations 'so far have not reported or identified human-to-human transmission.' 'However, this can change quickly as the virus is evolving, which is why we are actively assessing the situation and why surveillance is so critical,' she said. 300 million birds dead Although the WHO assesses the current risk of infection for the public as low, it considers the public health risk for farm workers and others exposed to infected animals to be low-to-moderate. The WHO advises exposed groups to use personal protective equipment such as coveralls, respirator masks, eye protection, gloves and boots to minimize the risk. Since October 2021, H5N1 has caused the deaths of more than 300 million birds worldwide, affecting the livelihood of millions of people. 'In addition to the direct impact on livelihoods, the economic burden on farmers can lead to reduced investments in biosecurity measures,' said Madhur Dhingra, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s senior infectious diseases animal health officer. 'This increases the risk and leads to a dangerous cycle of risk, vulnerability, and loss. … In regions heavily reliant on poultry as a primary protein source, HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] poses a serious threat to food and nutrition security,' she said. 'The impacts of HPAI have spilled over into wildlife, with more than 500 bird species and over 70 mammalian species affected, including endangered animals like the California condor and polar bears,' she said. 'The biodiversity impacts, particularly among seabirds and marine mammals, and disruption of fragile ecosystems, such as the Antarctic region, are concerning.' Health experts agree that increased surveillance and close monitoring of the evolution of the H5N1 virus are essential to prevent the disease from spreading widely around the world. 'We are in an interpandemic period right now where we have a number of different zoonotic viruses, with avian influenza, H5N1 one of several,' Van Kerkhove said. 'While we are operating in a state of readiness, I think the world is not ready for another infectious disease, massive outbreak or pandemic because we have lived through COVID and it was incredibly traumatic, and it is still ongoing. 'We are recommending to our member states and national authorities to increase surveillance and vigilance in human populations, especially those who are occupationally exposed, for the possibility for infection, and, of course, doing thorough investigations around each and every human case,' she said. In the meantime, she advised people to minimize their risk of becoming sick from bird flu by carefully watching what they eat and drink. 'Cows infected with the H5N1 virus have been reported to have high viral loads in their milk,' she said, so, it is advisable that people 'consume pasteurized milk.' 'If pasteurized milk is not available, heating milk until it boils also makes it safe for consumption. Similarly, we recommend thoroughly cooking meat and eggs when in areas affected by avian flu outbreaks,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-spillover-to-other-species-poses-global-health-threat-experts-warn/7906070.html	2024-12-18T11:28:40-08:00

Top US Senate Republican urges Supreme Court to reject TikTok appeal	WASHINGTON — Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell on Wednesday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the short-video app by January 19 or face a ban on national security grounds. The court has scheduled arguments on the case for January 10. McConnell in a brief filed with the court called the companies' arguments 'meritless and unsound. ... This is a standard litigation play at the end of one administration, with a petitioner hoping that the next administration will provide a stay of execution. This court should no more countenance it coming from foreign adversaries than it does from hardened criminals.' McConnell noted Congress set the January 19 date that 'very clearly removes any possible political uncertainty in the execution of the law by cabining it to an administration that was deeply supportive of the bill’s goals.' TikTok did not immediately comment. The company noted in legal filings that President-elect Donald Trump has said he does not want TikTok banned. The American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in a joint filing urged the court to block a ban of TikTok 'that millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.' The groups called the ban unprecedented, adding it 'will cause an extraordinary disruption in Americans’ ability to engage.' New downloads of TikTok on Apple or Google app stores would be banned but existing users could continue to access TikTok but services would degrade over time and eventually stop working as companies will be barred from providing support. TikTok said in a court filing this week it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using TikTok would stop accessing the app if the ban lasts a month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-us-senate-republican-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-tiktok-appeal/7906013.html	2024-12-18T10:52:39-08:00	
US repatriates 3 Guantanamo detainees, one held 17 years without charge	WASHINGTON — The United States has transferred two Malaysian detainees at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. military prison to their home country after they pleaded guilty to charges related to deadly 2002 bombings in Bali and agreed to testify against the alleged ringleader of that and other attacks, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Prosecutors say Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep worked for years with Encep Nurjaman, known as Hambali, an Indonesian leader of al-Qaida affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah. That includes helping Nurjaman escape after bombings on Oct. 12, 2002, killed 202 people at two nightspots in Bali, U.S. officials said. The two men entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and other charges in January. Their transfer comes after they provided testimony that prosecutors plan to use against Nurjaman, the alleged mastermind, the Pentagon said in a statement. Nurjaman is in custody in Guantanamo awaiting resumption of pretrial hearings in January involving the Bali bombings and other attacks. The two Malaysian men's transfers leave 27 detainees in custody at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay. Then-President George W. Bush set up a military tribunal and prison after the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on the United States. At its peak, Guantanamo detained hundreds of men, most of them Muslim, in the U.S.-led global war on terrorism after the attacks. Just two of the men at Guantanamo are serving sentences. U.S. prosecution of seven others currently facing charges has been slowed by legal obstacles — including those presented by the torture of the men in their first years under CIA custody — and logistical difficulties. Kenyan held 17 years On Tuesday, U.S. authorities repatriated a Kenyan man, Mohammed Abdul Malik Bajabu, after 17 years at Guantanamo without charge. His release leaves 15 other never-charged men awaiting release. The U.S. is searching for suitable and stable countries willing to take them. Many are from Yemen, a country split by war and dominated by an Iranian-allied militant group. Amnesty International urged President Joe Biden to end the detention of those never-charged men before he leaves office. If not, the rights group said in a statement, 'he will continue to bear responsibility for the abhorrent practice of indefinite detention without charge or trial by the U.S. government.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-repatriates-3-guantanamo-detainees-one-held-17-years-without-charge/7905849.html	2024-12-18T09:01:42-08:00

Kenyan president strongly defends animal vaccination program	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenya's president said Tuesday that a mass livestock vaccination campaign will continue despite fears of some herders and farmers that the inoculations will somehow hurt their animals. Kenyan President William Ruto lashed out at those objecting to a Ministry of Agriculture livestock vaccination program, which the ministry says is aimed at blocking the spread of several diseases and making the livestock meet international standards. Critics have questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines, and some livestock farmers expressed concern — not backed by any evidence — that the vaccine program is meant to sabotage their herds. Patrick Torome, a livestock farmer in the Rift Valley region of Kenya, said he will not allow his animals to be inoculated. 'I will not vaccinate my animals because maybe I will be compromising the quality of my cows,' he said. 'We don't know whether someone is trying to introduce a virus to the animals. So, the rich will be able to afford the cure but the poor maybe will not be able, so people will introduce poverty in Africa.' Ruto, speaking at a goat auction in Baringo County, said the vaccinations will help Kenyan farmers make money — and was critical of those who oppose them. 'I want to promise the people of Kenya that we are going to carry out this vaccination because our farmers deserve improved earnings,' he said. 'I want to ask leaders who have no knowledge, who have no understanding, who have no plan, to spare us their ignorance.' According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, the vaccination drive targets 22 million cattle and 50 million sheep and goats. The ministry has assured animal owners the vaccines are safe and are produced locally. Ruto said those against the vaccination of animals are preventing livestock owners from accessing international markets for their products. 'Vaccination is about disease control. … You cannot use disinformation and fake news to deny the people of Kenya international markets by discouraging disease control in Kenya,' he said. Anthrax, foot and mouth disease, rift valley fever, African swine fever and rinderpest are some of the diseases that affect livestock in Kenya. According to the World Health Organization, animal vaccination helps prevent and control the spread of the diseases. The Ministry of Agriculture says so far, only 10% of animals have been vaccinated. It says the vaccination rate needs to rise to 85% to make livestock products eligible for export. Some farmers and experts have blamed the government for the low uptake of vaccines, saying it failed to provide a clear message and allowed politicians to assume the roles of experts and veterinarians, which has fueled the false message about vaccines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-strongly-defends-animal-vaccination-program/7905837.html	2024-12-18T08:51:52-08:00	
Pentagon: Chinese military saw ‘new wave’ of corruption with senior leaders	PENTAGON — A Pentagon report says the Chinese military experienced 'a new wave' of corruption among its senior leaders last year that may have disrupted progress toward its military modernization goals, even as China ratcheted up aggression toward Taiwan and the Philippines. The U.S. Department of Defense’s annual China Military Power report released Wednesday says at least 15 high-ranking military officers and defense-industry executives were removed from their posts between July and December 2023. Several of the leaders who were investigated and removed for corruption had overseen projects related to modernizing Chinese ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles. 'I think it’s (the corruption is) having some impact already,' said a senior defense official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the Pentagon. Corruption in the military is not new, but it seeped into the top military leadership when Chinese Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu was removed from office in late October last year. Li led the Central Military Commission Equipment Development Department from 2017 to 2022, where he would have signed off on all People's Liberation Army, PLA, weapons acquisitions, before serving as defense minister. China’s military goals include completing a modernization by 2035 and becoming a 'world-class' military by the end of 2049. It also has set a 2027 goal as a short-term marker to make sure its modernization plans continue to progress. In 2027, the PLA will mark the 100th anniversary of its founding. The report calls Chinese progress toward its stated 2027 capability milestone 'uneven' without explicitly saying whether the Chinese military has been backsliding. 'We certainly do highlight and take very seriously the progress they're making in a number of the areas that we noted in the report, and at the same time, we try to take note of those areas in which they've demonstrated some shortcomings,' the official added. Despite China’s shrinking economy, Beijing’s defense spending was estimated at 40% to 90% more than it announced in its public defense budget, which equates to $330 billion to $450 billion in total defense spending for 2024. Chinese nuclear and missile capabilities China had more than 600 operational nuclear warheads in its stockpile as of mid-2024, according to the report, and will have more than 1,000 of these warheads by 2030. The arsenal’s growth is consistent with last year’s estimates. The United States maintains about 1,550 active warheads, based on treaty agreements, but its nuclear arsenal and infrastructure is aging. The Pentagon plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to update and replace it. In addition, the report says, China is developing new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces, and it may also be exploring the development of conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems. 'If developed and fielded, such capabilities would enable the PRC to threaten conventional strikes against targets in the continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska,' the report said, using the abbreviation for China's formal name, the People's Republic of China. The PRC continues to maintain the world’s leading hypersonic missile arsenal. Hypersonic weapons fly at five times the speed of sound and can maneuver and change trajectories during their glide phase, making them more difficult to defend against than ballistic missiles, which also fly at hypersonic speed but travel along a set trajectory. PLA navy The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong (CV-17) carried out three deployments to the Philippine Sea in 2023, a record number for a Chinese carrier in a calendar year, according to the report. The PLA navy also carried out the first extended area deployment of its new Yushen-class amphibious assault ship. The deployments show the PLA navy has continued to grow its ability to conduct missions beyond the first island chain that includes Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and portions of the Philippines. However, the senior official stressed, while the PLA has demonstrated some limited joint operational capabilities beyond the first island chain, its navy’s overseas activities in general lack inclusion from its army or air force and do not involve combat operations. China has the largest navy in the world, based on the number of ships in its fleet, but its numbers remained consistent to last year’s assessment. The Chinese have more than 370 ships and submarines, with more than 140 of those considered major surface vessels. In terms of producing military ships, maritime weapons and electronic systems, the report says, the Chinese defense industry is 'nearly self-sufficient for all shipbuilding needs.' Taiwan and the Philippines Increased Chinese military pressure against Taiwan 'continued to erode long-standing norms in and around' the democratic island in 2023, according to the report. Beijing has stated it wants to be ready to control the island by 2027, by force if necessary. China maintains a naval presence around Taiwan, and it has increased crossings into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone and conducted major military exercises nearby. This month, China massed dozens of navy and coast guard vessels in what appeared to be the largest maritime exercises targeting Taiwan since the 1990s. This week alone, China sent several military aircraft toward Taiwan, with four of the aircraft crossing the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that forms an unofficial border between the sides, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. Despite this increasingly aggressive behavior, the senior defense official told reporters that conflict with China over Taiwan was not 'imminent or inevitable.' 'We think that we have deterrence today that's real and strong. We're doing a lot to try to keep it that way,' the official told reporters. Tensions with the Philippines were also 'notably higher' last year, the report said. Chinese maritime vessels have used water cannon against Philippine vessels and even rammed into vessels that were trying to resupply the Second Thomas Shoal. Since late 2023, however, the Chinese military has reduced the number of risky air intercepts of American military aircraft, according to the report, while continuing 'unsafe maneuvers' near allied forces in the region. The shift in behavior toward the U.S. military appeared to coincide with diplomatic developments: President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to resume military-to-military communication in late 2023. Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, warned that China’s aggressive posture toward Taiwan and the Philippines is likely to continue until the United States and its allies shift Beijing’s cost-benefit analysis. 'Any reduction in direct aggressive activity toward the United States is a temporary measure and should not be misinterpreted as a fundamental change in Beijing’s grand strategy or hostility toward the United States and its interests,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chinese-military-saw-new-wave-of-corruption-with-senior-leaders/7905760.html	2024-12-18T08:07:53-08:00	
Sewage-polluted lake water kills rhinos, other wildlife in Zimbabwe	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — A Zimbabwean national park is hosting relocated wildlife from a game park just outside the country's capital after an autopsy report on Saturday confirmed that four rhinos and several other animals died after drinking contaminated lake water. Tinashe Farawo, the spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, confirmed to VOA the death of four rhinos after drinking bacteria-polluted water at Lake Chivero Recreational Park, about 20 kilometers west of the capital, Harare. 'We are not only losing the rhinos, but [we] also lost some zebras, wildebeest and some birds,' Farawo said. 'We have tried to treat some of the rhinos, but unfortunately it seems like we are not managing at the moment. But we have made some temporary collective measures to make sure we do the best we can with this challenge,' he said, referring to the temporary transfer of wildlife away from the lake. 'We need to continue to make sure that at least we deal with the issue of pollution around Lake Chivero,' Farawo said. Amkela Sidange, spokesperson for the Environmental Management Agency of Zimbabwe, said that, nationwide, about 415 megaliters of untreated sewage are being discharged into the environment daily. The 'city of Harare on its own ... contributes about 219 megaliters of raw and partly treated sewer that is discharged into the environment on a daily basis, and that goes to show how huge the crisis is,' she said. 'We need the whole of government and societal approach,' Sidange said, adding that temporary solutions aren’t getting the job done. Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume said he is counting on the central government to provide money to help the city provide proper sewer services, especially for those who live in 'informal settlements.' 'We have over 150,000 informal settlements, and these informal settlements do not have sewer reticulation systems,' he said. 'Therefore, their discharge is going straight into our water bodies.' While the bickering continues among high-ranking officials about who is polluting Harare water with cyanobacteria, Farai Maguwu, director of the Center for Natural Resource Governance, is worried about the residents of Zimbabwe’s capital. 'There is a need to carry out scientific investigations about the water that is pumped into people’s homes by Harare city council and see if that water is still safe for drinking and inform the citizens of Harare accordingly,' Maguwu said. On Tuesday, Mafume declared that Harare’s water was still meeting the World Health Organization’s standards and was safe for drinking. The city council provides bottled water during its meetings and, for years now, many residents of Harare drink bottled water and water from boreholes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sewage-polluted-lake-water-kills-rhinos-other-wildlife-in-zimbabwe/7905685.html	2024-12-18T07:21:12-08:00	
Analysts: Syrian rebels adopt approach similar to Taliban's to seek international recognition	Washington — While the international community is setting conditions for the new rulers in Syria, the leading rebel group has taken a conciliatory approach, similar to one the Taliban adopted in Afghanistan, to seek international recognition, say analysts. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, met with the U.N. special envoy for Syria on Sunday and emphasized 'rapid and effective cooperation' to rebuild Syria's economy and maintain its territorial integrity. In an interview with The Times of London, al-Jolani said that Syrian soil will not be used against any neighboring country, including Israel. Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, told VOA that HTS presented 'a conciliatory message,' similar to the one the Taliban presented after seizing power in 2021, by 'positioning itself in regional politics in a way that would not provoke regional countries [and global powers] against them.' After seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban tried to assure the neighboring countries and regional powers that the group would not allow anyone to use Afghanistan as a launchpad against any country. But the U.N. said in July that while the Taliban claims there are no foreign terrorist groups in Afghanistan, member states reported more than two dozen terrorist groups were operating inside the country. He added that HTS learned from its own experience, and also from observing the Taliban, to avoid making enemies overseas 'by signaling and trying to assure them that look, we don't have any beef with you,' Mir said. Mir said the global and regional powers have relatively moderate aims when dealing with the rebels in Syria, 'but they are going to spend time watching HTS.' Syrian rebels, led by HTS, started an offensive against former President Bashar al-Assad's forces on November 27 in the northern Idlib province and, after capturing some strategic cities, seized control of the capital, Damascus, in 11 days. The U.S. welcomed the rebels' 'hopeful' statements but said that 'we're going to judge them by their actions.' 'We're going to make our decisions when it comes to sanction posture, when it comes to recognition, posture, when it comes to all the tools in our toolbox, based on what we see from HTS and other actors on the ground here,' Mathew Miller, the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Monday in response to a question from VOA. A top EU diplomat said Sunday the European Union would not lift sanctions on Syria before its new rulers provide guarantees to safeguard minorities and women's rights and disavow terrorism. The international community demanded similar guarantees from the Taliban after the group seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. The international community urged that the Taliban honor their commitments to counter terrorism, form an inclusive government and respect human rights, particularly women's rights, before they were recognized as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. No country has yet formally recognized the Taliban, though many countries have established diplomatic relations with the Taliban government. Colin Clarke, the director of research at The Soufan Group, told VOA that the U.S. policy toward Syria is shaped by its experience in Afghanistan. 'I think that informs a lot of what they do in terms of foreign policy,' said Clarke. He said there are 'a lot of similarities' between how the Taliban and HTS present themselves. 'Being more pragmatic, being more moderate, distancing themselves from more hardcore Jihadist ideology,' he added. larke said the question, though, is whether HTS would remain moderate. He said concerns exist about hardcore foreign militants, particularly those from Central Asia, within the rebel groups. 'They may defect and either split off their own, or they may want to go and join other groups like IS because they may see this whole governing project as a fool's errand,' he added. The U.N., the U.S., Turkey, and many other countries have designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS is 'a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or 'Nusrah Front,' al-Qaida's former branch in Syria,' says the website of the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. agency with primary responsibility for analyzing and integrating information on international terrorism. In 2013, the U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa as a global terrorist, and the U.S. offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Though the Taliban are not designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, the Haqqani Network, now part of the Taliban's government, is among the U.S.-designated terrorist groups. Clarke said he thinks the Syrian rebels will be recognized sooner than the Taliban because they represent 'a newer phenomenon, and they don't have as many skeletons in the closet at this point.' Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank, said it is 'very difficult' to compare the Syrian rebels to the Taliban. 'With Syria, it was freeing the Syrian people from a brutal regime. With Afghanistan, it was essentially the return of a brutal regime to power,' said Khurma. But, she said, in both cases the governments these groups fought against suffered from 'low morale.' 'It does showcase that both systems were already eroding,' she said.

Chadian election officials ask military for protection ahead of vote	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad's electoral commission has asked the central African state’s military to help protect election officials and candidates amid a spike in attacks ahead of Dec. 29 elections. Witnesses say opposition supporters have used clubs and iron bars to prevent the ruling MPS party from holding rallies in several cities and towns. The National Election Management Agency in Chad, known as ANGE, said campaigning for the parliamentary, local council and regional elections has been plagued by attempts to disrupt rallies and attacks on candidates and elections officials. Chadian officials say the elections will mark an end to the central African state’s three-year 'transitional period' following the April 2021 death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno. ANGE Vice President Assane Bairra said ongoing tensions may worsen into armed conflicts if Chad's military fails to deploy troops. ANGE reported that more than 8.3 million of Chad's 18 million civilians have registered to vote. About 180 political parties have put forward nearly 1,300 candidates to compete in the country's parliamentary elections, with several thousand others taking part in local council and provincial elections, according to Chad's government. More than 1,000 election observers have been accredited for the polls. However, a coalition of over 75 opposition parties and civil society groups describe the planned polls as a 'masquerade,' saying that Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno and his Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, are planning to use the polls to consolidate their grip on power. Opposition and civil society groups said their supporters this week used clubs and iron bars to attack MPS campaign caravans in several towns, including Ndjamena, Bongor, Abeche, Lai and Moundou. In other areas, the military said, it has dismantled roadblocks set up by opposition parties to prevent MPS campaigners from entering towns. Avocksouma Djona, president of Chad's Party of Democrats, said his supporters have been blocking campaigners from both MPS and the opposition from holding election rallies. He said his party wants elections to be postponed because all the officials of Chad's elections management body were appointed by Deby. He also said Deby controls Chad's constitutional court and has instructed the court to declare his party victorious in all elections. ANGE organizes elections and declares provisional results. The country's constitutional court declares final results. Deby appoints officials to both institutions. Deby told state TV this week that elections for Chad to fully return to civilian rule will be fair and transparent. Opposition groups quickly dismissed that claim, saying the Chadian leader wants to rig the polls to ensure control of parliament. Deby became Chad's transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power. He promised an 18-month transition to civilian rule but extended it by two years. Deby won Chad's contested May 6 presidential polls, which many opposition parties boycotted, asserting that Deby wanted at all costs to continue his late father's rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-election-officials-ask-military-for-protection-ahead-of-vote/7905643.html	2024-12-18T06:37:00-08:00

VOA Kurdish: Iraqi and Kurdish officials deny reports of Maher al-Assad fleeing to Sulaymaniyah	Maher al-Assad, the brother of ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and commander of the Syrian army's fourth armored division, has not fled to Sulaymaniyah, according to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Saadi Ahmed Pira, PUK spokesman, dismissed the reports as politically motivated, emphasizing that Sulaymaniyah is not geographically accessible from Syria. 'Sulaymaniyah airport has no direct flights to Damascus, and the city is not located on the sea, so it is unclear how someone from Syria could even reach Sulaymaniyah,' Pira said. Iraqi authorities also rejected the claims. These allegations follow earlier speculation that Maher al-Assad had traveled through Iraq to Iran and then to Russia.

Xi Jinping visits Macau to mark 25 years of Chinese rule	MACAU — China's President Xi Jinping arrived in Macau on Wednesday to mark a quarter century of Beijing's rule over the former Portuguese enclave, and is likely during his three-day visit to urge further diversification from its casino industry. Xi's trip to the world's biggest gambling hub is his third as president, during which he will attend the inauguration of the territory's new chief executive, elected in October. Xi last visited in 2019 when anti-government protests were rocking the neighboring financial hub of Hong Kong. A special administrative region of China, Macau is the only place in the country where gambling is legal, and its economy is heavily dependent on the casino industry, which contributes about 80% of regional tax revenue. Located on China's southern coast, Macau returned to Chinese rule on December 20, 1999, governed under the same 'one country, two systems' formula as Hong Kong. Beijing has consistently praised Macau for its loyalty and stability, with more than half of its 700,000 population immigrating from China in recent decades. The city was on high security ahead of Xi's arrival on Wednesday, with several roads closed and Macau's light rapid transit operator announcing the temporary closure of a key section. Xi, who was greeted at Macau's airport by dozens of cheering school children waving yellow and red flowers and lion dancers, said Macau was the 'jewel of the motherland.' 'I have always been concerned about the development of this place and the well-being of all its residents,' he told the crowd, which included senior government officials and Macau's current leader Ho Iat Seng. 'In the next few days, I will take a walk, have a look, and have extensive and in-depth exchanges with friends from all walks of life to discuss Macau's development plans.' Since he took office in 2013, Xi has called for the Macanese economy's 'appropriate diversification and sustainable development,' including casinos and the flow of funds across borders within a sweeping anti-corruption drive. The move has throttled gambling revenues from the high roller VIP sector. On Thursday, Xi is scheduled to attend a banquet dinner and cultural performance at the Macau Dome, located alongside Macau's Las Vegas-style Cotai strip, according to the city's government. On Friday, he will attend the anniversary ceremony and the inauguration of Chief Executive Sam Hou Fai, 62, who was born in China's southern Guangdong province and speaks fluent Portuguese. Sam, head of Macau's highest court since 1999, will become the first city leader to be born and raised in mainland China. He was the only candidate given permission by a panel of 400 pro-China loyalists to run in Macau's election. In December, Sam unveiled his team of officials to govern Macau for the next five years. Among them is Tai Kin Ip, a seasoned economy minister whose mandate is to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on gambling revenue brought in by operators Wynn Macau, Sands China, SJM Holdings, Galaxy Entertainment, Melco, and MGM China. Sam has vowed to improve residents' livelihoods and develop non-gaming industries once he takes charge on Friday. He said Macau will also develop its role as a conduit between Chinese and Portuguese-speaking countries and its collaboration with other southern Chinese cities in the Greater Bay Area. At Beijing's directive, last year Macau's government rolled out its first economic blueprint centered on a strategy envisaging tourism and leisure as the main pillars. Chinese flags and red congratulatory banners fluttered along roads and over buildings around the city in preparation for the 25th-anniversary celebrations. Casino exteriors displayed large signs to welcome Xi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-jinping-visits-macau-to-mark-25-years-of-chinese-rule/7905424.html	2024-12-18T02:25:13-08:00	
Gaza medics say Israeli strikes kill at least 12	Medics said Wednesday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 12 people in the Gaza Strip. The strikes included one in the town of Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, that killed at least 10 people, the medics said. Other Israeli strikes hit central Gaza and the Rafah area in the southern part of the Palestinian enclave. The continued violence came amid a fresh push to secure a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the militant group Hamas that would include the release of hostages still being held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials in recent days have cited optimism about a potential breakthrough in the long-stalled negotiations, while Hamas said Tuesday it believes a deal is possible if Israel does not add new conditions. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have worked for months to try to broker an agreement. The Gaza conflict began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. About 100 hostages are still being held, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-medics-say-israeli-strikes-kill-at-least-12/7905419.html	2024-12-18T02:16:32-08:00	
G20 watchdog urges governments to address non-bank financial risks	ZURICH — The Financial Stability Board (FSB) on Wednesday pitched recommendations for governments to reduce risks around hedge funds, insurers and other non-bank financial intermediaries, which now account for almost half of global financial assets. The sector of non-bank financial intermediation has grown by around 130% between 2009 and 2023, making markets more vulnerable for stress events, according to the Basel-based FSB, which acts as the G20's financial risk watchdog. 'This growth comes with an increase in complexity and interconnectedness in the financial system, which, if not properly managed, can pose substantial risks to financial stability,' said FSB Secretary-General John Schindler. In its consultation report, the FSB proposed member governments and institutions enhance their focus on non-banks and ensure they manage their credit risks adequately. One set of recommendations calls for the creation of domestic frameworks to identify and monitor financial stability risks related to non-bank leverage. Another group proposes that policy measures be selected, designed and calibrated by governments to mitigate the identified financial stability risks. A third group deals with counterparty credit risk management, calling for a timely and thorough implementation of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's revised guidelines. The FSB also proposed stepping up private disclosure practices in the non-bank sector and addressing any regulatory inconsistencies by adopting the principle of 'same risk, same regulatory treatment.' A last recommendation calls for improved cross-border cooperation and collaboration. With the consultation report, the FSB is inviting comments from member governments and institutions on its policy recommendations. A final report is planned for release in mid-2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g20-watchdog-urges-governments-to-address-non-bank-financial-risks/7905414.html	2024-12-18T02:07:41-08:00	
Rescuers dig for survivors of Vanuatu earthquake with no water and unclear death toll	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Vanuatu's capital was without water on Wednesday, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by a violent magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation, with the number of people killed and injured expected to rise. The government's disaster management office said early Wednesday that 14 deaths were confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was 'expected to increase' as people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 have been treated for injuries. Frantic rescue efforts that began at flattened buildings after the quake hit early Tuesday afternoon, continued 30 hours later, with dozens working in dust and heat with little water to seek those yelling for help from inside. A few more survivors were extracted from the rubble of downtown buildings in Port Vila, also the country's largest city, while others remained trapped and some were found dead. A near-total telecommunications collapse meant people struggled to confirm their relatives' safety. Some providers began Wednesday to reestablish phone service but connections were patchy. Internet service had not been restored because the submarine cable supplying it was damaged, the operator said. The earthquake hit at a depth of 57 kilometers and was centered 30 kilometers west of the capital of Vanuatu, a group of 80 islands home to about 330,000 people. A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake, but dozens of large aftershocks continued to rattle the country. The Asia-Pacific head of the International Federation of Red Cross, Katie Greenwood, speaking to The Associated Press from Fiji, said it was not clear how many people were still missing or killed. 'We have anecdotal information coming from people at the search and rescue site that are fairly confident that unfortunately those numbers will rise,' she said. The capital’s main medical facility, Vila Central Hospital, was badly damaged and patients were moved to a military camp. Clement Chipokolo, Vanuatu country director at the Christian relief agency World Vision, said health care services, already strained before the quake, were overwhelmed. No water in Port Vila While power was out in swathes of Port Vila, the biggest fear among aid agencies was the lack of water. Two large reservoirs serving the capital were totally decimated, the National Disaster Management Office said. Resident Milroy Cainton said people were joining large queues to buy water in stores, but could only purchase two or four bottles at a time. 'People are not really concerned about electricity. They're just concerned about water,' he said. UNICEF was recording a rise in diarrhea among children, a sign that they had begun to drink tainted water, said the chief of the Vanuatu office, Eric Durpaire. Officials told residents of areas where water had been restored to boil it. Some people remain trapped under the rubble At least 10 buildings sustained major damage, many in a busy downtown area full of lunchtime shoppers when the quake hit. An unknown number of people were trapped inside, and Cainton, the resident, said rescuers had been forced to target their efforts to where they believed people could be saved. Michael Thompson, who runs a tourism business in Vanuatu, was among the rescuers and posted a video on Facebook of the frenzied efforts and dust-covered survivors on gurneys along with pleas for people to bring tools and water to the site. Officials said Wednesday night that Port Vila appeared to be the worst-hit area, but some nearby villages and offshore islands had experienced landslides. Three bridges were 'at high risk of collapse' in heavy rain, the government said. Embassies are damaged A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila — including those of the United States, Britain, France and New Zealand — was destroyed, with a section of the building cleaving off and flattening the first floor. Windows were buckled and walls crumbled. The U.S. State Department said its embassy staff were safe, but the building was no longer functional. The office opened in July as part of a push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China’s influence in the region. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said officials have accounted for all embassy staff. Australia’s foreign ministry said its workers were safe. All flights grounded Damage to the seaport and airport is likely to hamper aid efforts and economic recovery in a country dependent on agricultural exports and tourism. The airport was closed to commercial flights for a further 72 hours from Wednesday. But the runway was deemed functional for humanitarian flights by French engineers, who arrived by helicopter. Military craft from Australia and New Zealand were due to begin arriving Wednesday night, carrying search and rescue personnel and equipment, as well as relief supplies. Dan McGarry, a journalist living in Vanuatu, said there had been a 'massive landslide' at the international shipping terminal. The government said the main wharf was closed. Vanuatu’s position on a subduction zone — where the Indo-Australian tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate — means earthquakes of greater than magnitude 6 are not uncommon, and the country’s buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-dig-for-survivors-of-vanuatu-earthquake-with-no-water-and-unclear-death-toll/7905409.html	2024-12-18T01:50:07-08:00	
Nissan, Honda confirm talks on closer collaboration but say there's been no decision on a merger	BANGKOK — Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger. Nissan’s share price soared more than 22% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world’s third-largest automaking group. Honda’s share price fell as much as 3%. The reports said that Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. was included in the talks. All three Japanese automakers announced in August that they planned to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March. Trading in Nissan’s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were 'considering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.' A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Joining forces would help the two companies gain larger scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Nissan has an alliance with Renault SA that is under review. Last month, it said it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of $61 million. Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes. He said Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China. The ascent of Chinese automakers is shaking up the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4.2 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger, Toyota would remain the biggest Japanese automaker.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nissan-honda-confirm-talks-on-closer-collaboration-but-say-there-s-been-no-decision-on-a-merger/7905398.html	2024-12-18T01:06:11-08:00	
Community members wrestle with grief in aftermath of Wisconsin school shooting	MADISON, Wis. — Community members in Wisconsin continued to wrestle with grief and called for change in the aftermath of a school shooting that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six others. Several hundred people gathered outside the Wisconsin State Capitol for a vigil Tuesday night to honor those slain at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison the day before, with some passing candles to each other and standing close against the winter chill. Among those in attendance was Naomi Allen, 16, who was in a nearby classroom Monday when a 15-year-old girl attacked people in a study hall before fatally shooting herself. 'It’s doesn’t matter who you are or where you are, something like this could happen. There’s nothing that is going to exempt someone,' Allen said at the vigil. Allen's father, Jay Allen, reflected on the dangers students face these days. 'When I was in school these things never happened,' he said. 'This country at some point needs to take mental health seriously and we need to pour resources into it. We really need some changes in the way we handle that issue.' The motive for the shooting appears to be a 'combination of factors,' Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said Tuesday as he appealed to the public to call in to a tip line and share what they might know about the shooter. He offered no details about what that motive might be, though he said bullying at Abundant Life Christian School would be investigated. He also said police are investigating writings that may have been penned by the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, and could shed light on her actions. 'Identifying a motive is our top priority, but at this time it appears that the motive is a combination of factors,' Barnes told reporters. Two students among the six people wounded Monday remain in critical condition. Officials have declined to disclose the names of the victims. 'Leave them alone,' Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said. The school shooting was the latest among dozens across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to doing active shooter drills in their classrooms. But school shootings have done little to move the needle on national gun laws. School shootings by teenage females have been extremely rare in U.S. history, with males in their teens and 20s carrying out the majority of them, said David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting Database. Abundant Life is a nondenominational Christian school — prekindergarten through high school — with approximately 420 students. Barbara Wiers, the school's director of elementary and school relations, said the school does not have metal detectors but uses cameras and other security measures. Barnes said police were talking with the shooter’s father and other family members, who were cooperating, and searching the shooter's home. The shooter's parents, who are divorced, jointly shared custody of their child, but the shooter primarily lived with her 42-year-old father, according to court documents. Investigators believe the shooter used a 9mm pistol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Madison resident Cristian Cuahutepitzi said he attended Tuesday's vigil to let the families of the victims know 'we're thinking of them.' He said his uncle's two daughters go to the school. 'They're still a little bit shook,' he said. Joe Gothard, the superintendent of the Madison Metropolitan School District, said at the vigil that the tragedy happened less than two blocks away from his childhood home. He said it wasn't enough to say the district would work on safety. 'We need to connect like we are tonight, each and every day and make a commitment that we know we’re there for one another, hopefully to avoid preventable tragedies like yesterday,' he said. A prayer service was also held Tuesday night at City Church Madison, which is affiliated with the school. Several teachers from the school prayed aloud one by one during the service, speaking into a microphone and standing in a line. One middle school teacher asked for courage, while another sought help quieting her own soul. 'God, this isn’t a Abundant Life Christian School tragedy,' said Derrick Wright, the youth pastor at the church. 'This is a community tragedy. This is a nation tragedy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/community-members-wrestle-with-grief-in-aftermath-of-wisconsin-school-shooting-/7905395.html	2024-12-18T00:54:48-08:00	
Top creditor China has not approved any loans to Cambodia so far this year, data shows	China has not approved any new loans to Cambodia in the first nine months of 2024, Cambodian finance ministry data shows, even though it has been Cambodia's top creditor country in recent years. The reduction in funding may signal China's more cautious approach to investment in Cambodia after a series of so-far unsuccessful infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian country. China accounts for more than a third of the country's $11.6 billion in outstanding debt, Cambodian government data shows. But no new loan was signed from January to September this year after lending of nearly $212 million over the same period last year, the data shows. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry did not respond to a question about loans but said on December 11 that 'China and Cambodia are iron-clad friends. We will continue to strengthen cooperation with Cambodia and support Cambodia in promoting development and improving people's livelihood.' Meas Soksensan, a spokesman for Cambodia's finance ministry, did not reply to a request for comment for this article. However, in a Facebook post on Sunday to counter what he said was information he had seen on social media about China-Cambodia relations, he wrote: 'I find laughable the information that was shared that China stops providing loans.' 'We have a lot of projects that the countries will review and will sign agreements of financing, including grants and other concessional loans,' he said. He did not comment about data published by the finance ministry about lending so far this year. Overall lending to Cambodia was not affected by China's lack of funding, as other creditors have stepped in with loans totaling around $1 billion, almost as much as was lent to the country in the first nine months of last year. The World Bank has signed loans worth $564 million so far this year, making it Cambodia's top lender for 2024, followed by Japan with $262 million. Last year, China was Cambodia' top lender among partner countries, providing more than $300 million for the full year. Only the World Bank did more last year, with signed loans worth half a billion dollars, according to official data. In 2022, Beijing topped the overall list of lenders with $567 million in signed loans, followed by Japan and the Asian Development Bank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-creditor-china-has-not-approved-any-loans-to-cambodia-so-far-this-year-data-shows-/7905387.html	2024-12-18T00:31:32-08:00	
Zelenskyy to meet with NATO, European leaders in push to bolster defenses	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Wednesday with NATO chief Mark Rutte and European leaders in Brussels as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defenses against Russian forces. Zelenskyy on Tuesday cited an urgent need to boost military aid to Ukraine, especially air defense systems. 'We must do everything possible to destroy Russia’s ability to wage war from as far away as possible,' Zelenskyy said. 'For this, we need more drones, more modern artillery, and long-range missiles.' Wednesday’s talks come a month before U.S. President Donald Trump takes office, bringing uncertainty about the level of continued U.S. support for Ukraine from the new administration. Among those expected to meet with Zelenskyy in Brussels were German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Council President António Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Ahead of the talks, Russia launched another round of overnight aerial attacks. Ihor Taburets, governor of Ukraine’s Cherkasy region, said Wednesday on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 13 drones. He said there was no damage to infrastructure in the area. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said Wednesday that Ukrainian forces shot down two drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region, along with a drone over Bryansk and another over Kursk. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-to-meet-with-nato-european-leaders-in-push-to-bolster-defenses/7905371.html	2024-12-17T23:49:30-08:00	
Vietnam seeks to boost domestic defense industry as it hosts arms fair	HANOI — Vietnam will showcase locally made weapons at an international arms fair in Hanoi on Thursday, as it seeks to boost its domestic industry and possibly export military equipment. Among the nearly 250 exhibitors will be top defense companies, including from the United States, Europe, Turkey and countries at war with each other, such as Israel, Iran, Russia and Ukraine. The Southeast Asian nation is a major importer of weapons, especially from Russia, having invested for years in its defense capabilities in an unstable region where it has clashed with China over boundaries in the South China Sea. But recently it has also bolstered its domestic defense industry and promoting exports of military products is now a priority, defense ministry officials have repeatedly said. State-owned defense firm Viettel and other local companies will showcase missile defense systems, drones, air defense radars, armored vehicles and artillery, according to defense ministry media. Some of these weapons will be displayed for the first time, said Nguyen The Phuong, an expert on Vietnam security at Australia's University of New South Wales. He noted a key strategy to strengthen the local industry had been the signing of deals with foreign arms exporters to have some of their components produced in Vietnam. Talks with South Korean companies were underway for possible new deals under those conditions, especially for artillery and aviation, he said. Similar talks had also been held with companies from other countries, including the Czech Republic, officials said. Rivals' gear on display At the expo, Iran's defense ministry will have an entire pavilion, not far from the booths of Israel's defense firms Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The fair will also host a dozen booths of Russian firms and one for Ukraine's Motor Sich, an aircraft engine manufacturer. A dozen Turkish defense companies, including Aselsan, Turkish Aerospace Industries and Roketsan, are among listed participants, making Turkey's one of the largest delegations. China's Norinco will be one of two Chinese exhibitors, in a first for a Vietnamese defense fair. U.S. defense giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Textron Aviation Defense will also have their booths at the fair. They have all been involved in talks with Vietnamese authorities for the sale of helicopters. Lockheed is also discussing a possible deal on C-130 Hercules military transport planes, sources had told Reuters. Brazil's Embraer said it will exhibit its C-390 Millennium plane - a rival to the C-130. Top European defense firms will also attend, including aerospace giant Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems, Germany's Rheinmetall, Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales Group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-seeks-to-boost-domestic-defense-industry-as-it-hosts-arms-fair/7905366.html	2024-12-17T23:29:52-08:00	
Return to Earth for 2 stuck NASA astronauts delayed until March	CAPE CANAVERAL, florida — NASA's two stuck astronauts just got their space mission extended again. That means they won't be back on Earth until spring, 10 months after rocketing into orbit on Boeing's Starliner capsule. NASA on Tuesday announced the latest delay in the homecoming for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. The two test pilots planned on being away just a week or so when they blasted off June 5 on Boeing's first astronaut flight to the International Space Station. Their mission grew from eight days to eight months after NASA decided to send the company's problem-plagued Starliner capsule back empty in September. Now the pair won't return until the end of March or even April because of a delay in launching their replacements, according to NASA. A fresh crew needs to launch before Wilmore and Williams can return, and the next mission has been bumped more than a month, according to the space agency. NASA's next crew of four was supposed to launch in February, followed by Wilmore's and Williams' return home by the end of that month alongside two other astronauts. But SpaceX needs more time to prepare the new capsule for liftoff. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier than late March. NASA said it considered using a different SpaceX capsule to fly up the replacement crew in order to keep the flights on schedule. But it decided the best option was to wait for the new capsule to transport the next crew. NASA prefers to have overlapping crews at the space station for a smoother transition, according to officials. Most space station missions last six months, with a few reaching a full year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/return-to-earth-for-2-stuck-nasa-astronauts-delayed-until-march-/7905291.html	2024-12-17T18:10:18-08:00	
Vanuatu earthquake death toll rises to 14 as rescuers continue search	Rescuers in Vanuatu on Wednesday searched for people still trapped after a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Pacific nation's capital, Port Vila, on Tuesday, killing 14 people and damaging reservoirs, commercial buildings, embassies and a hospital. At least 200 people were being treated for injuries at the capital's main hospital and other medical centers, a Red Cross official said on X, citing the Vanuatu government. 'Rescue ops continue to free those trapped after the quake, and attention turns to urgent needs like first aid, shelter and water,' said Katie Greenwood, head of the delegation for the Pacific at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Vanuatu police said in a statement there had been deaths and many injuries, without giving numbers. National broadcaster VBTC showed people queuing for fuel and essentials on Wednesday morning. Rescue efforts continued at one of the collapsed buildings, Billabong House, where people had been trapped under rubble. Footage posted on social media showed vehicles crushed under the debris, boulders strewn across a highway and landslides near Port Vila's international shipping terminal. Basil Leodoro, an emergency doctor in Vanuatu with health emergency firm Respond Global, said two buildings — Billabong House and a Chinese store — had collapsed, with rescuers trying to save people. 'So far they have been able to remove two casualties,' he said in a social media post, citing police reports. Concrete pillars on a building in the capital hosting foreign missions, including the U.S., British, French and New Zealand embassies, collapsed in the powerful quake. Triage tents have been set up outside Port Vila's hospital to manage the influx of patients. Aftershocks overnight Several aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.1, rattled Vanuatu overnight. 'Even just two minutes ago, we had another shock ... probably wouldn't even count how many. Loads and loads of aftershocks throughout the night,' Australian Caroline Bird, who manages a resort in Port Vila, told ABC News on Wednesday. Caretaker Prime Minister Charlot Salwai said a national disaster committee has declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew for seven days in the worst-affected areas. International assistance has been sought. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said two military planes would fly to Vanuatu on Wednesday morning with a medical assistance team and a search-and-rescue team. 'This is a very significant incident, and we hold anxiety about how it will unfold,' he told ABC Radio. New Zealand said it would send a plane to check if aircraft could land in Vanuatu, where the international airport remained closed. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated 116,000 people, around one-third of the country's population, had been affected by the earthquake. Australian Michael Thompson, who runs a zip line adventure business in Vanuatu, said in a post on Facebook that he had been helping to dig people out of the rubble overnight. 'Three people have been removed alive with one in a very serious condition ... incredible displays of bravery with people entering confined spaces to conduct rescues,' Thompson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vanuatu-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-14-as-rescuers-continue-search-/7905288.html	2024-12-17T18:01:45-08:00

Syrian military bases destroyed after Assad’s fall	Following the collapse of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, military rebels and the Israeli military have targeted strongholds throughout the country.

Police look for motive in latest US school shooting	Police in Madison, Wisconsin, said Tuesday that they were working to establish a motive for the shooting at a small, private Christian school that killed a teacher and a student and wounded six other people. 'Identifying a motive is our top priority,' Police Chief Shon Barnes said of the shooting Monday that he called a 'hurting and haunting situation.' Police were trying to verify a document posted online by the 15-year-old shooter, who apparently died of a self-inflicted wound. Authorities said the shooter, Natalie Rupnow, was a student at the Abundant Life Christian School, which has an enrollment of just over 400 students from kindergarten to high school. She opened fire in a study hall late Monday morning. 'We don't know nearly enough yet,' Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway told reporters Tuesday about the shooting. Rhodes-Conway also said it was too early to determine whether the shooter's parents, who were cooperating with the police investigation, would face criminal charges. 'We have to allow law enforcement the time and space for a careful and methodical examination,' she said. Barnes said Tuesday that several schools across the Madison metropolitan area 'were targeted by false threats, often known as swatting.' He said police and the school district were working together to determine who initiated the scheme. The mayor lashed out at reporters' requests Tuesday for more information about the victims. 'I'm going to say this and then we're done,' she said. 'It is absolutely none of y'all's business who was harmed in this incident. Please have some human decency and respect for the people who have lost loved ones or were injured themselves or whose children were injured. Just have some human decency, folks.' Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking in Maryland, said, 'Our nation mourns for those who were killed, and we pray for the recovery of those who were injured.' The vice president said stronger gun controls were needed. 'Solutions are in hand,' she said, 'but we need elected leaders to have the courage to step up and do the right thing.' President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that the shooting was 'shocking and unconscionable.' 'Every child deserves to feel safe in their classroom,' he said. 'Students across our country should be learning how to read and write, not having to learn how to duck and cover.' Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the shooting victims. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-look-for-motive-in-latest-us-school-shooting/7905275.html	2024-12-17T17:22:19-08:00	
US Senate to vote on bill that fuels possibility of Chinese drone ban	WASHINGTON — The 2025 defense spending authorization bill is coming up to a final vote in the U.S. Senate. As the American Northeast buzzes with drone sightings and fears of foreign surveillance, the bill moves to ban products from the world's largest drone-maker: China. In a procedural vote on Monday, senators voted 83-12 in favor of moving to a full vote on the National Defense Authorization Act, a massive piece of annual legislation that sets priorities and authorizes funding for the U.S. Department of Defense. A provision within the 2025 NDAA aims to create mechanisms for further oversight and prohibition of the use of Chinese drones while working to increase drone supply chain resilience within the U.S. and partner countries. The bill mandates an investigation into two Chinese drone manufacturers, DJI and Autel Robotics, with the aim of placing them on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 'Covered List.' This would prevent their use in telecommunications industries. Another section calls for the Department of Defense to regularly disassemble and analyze the components of DJI drones. The provision on drones draws in part from earlier anti-Chinese drone legislation introduced by Republican Representative Elise Stefanik and Senator Rick Scott. These bills received bipartisan support, showing how concerns over the risk that Chinese drones pose to U.S. national security have united a politically divided Congress. 'DJI drones pose the national security threat of TikTok, but with wings,' Stefanik said. 'This Chinese-controlled company cannot be allowed to continue to operate in the U.S.' During an interview on Fox News, Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi described how he collaborated with Stefanik to draft legislation on Chinese drones to be included in the NDAA. 'These Chinese-manufactured drones allow for the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, to access data in a backdoor manner and ultimately surveil Americans,' Krishnamoorthi said. China's DJI dominates the production and sale of household drones, with 2021 estimates suggesting that the company accounts for 76% of the worldwide consumer market and about 90% of the U.S. market. While more companies have emerged in past years, DJI still controls the largest share of the market. This gives the U.S. an increased imperative to diversify the domestic drone economy, Carlos Gimenez, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee, told VOA. 'We have to go a little cold turkey on this one. To say, ‘No, we can't buy that anymore,’' Gimenez said. 'You have to look for other suppliers, which then will slowly incentivize American companies to start building them.' While the Chinese drone ban has bipartisan support within Congress, it faces pushback from drone enthusiasts and nongovernmental organizations that oppose a blanket ban on Chinese drone products. Brandon Karr, spokesperson for the nonprofit Law Enforcement Drone Association (LEDA), supports the development of stricter and more rigorous data security regulations for drones rather than an all-out ban, which could pose problems for American law enforcement and safety agencies. Karr has written to Congress, advocating for agencies to develop their own protocol and oversight for drone data security and to maintain their right to use Chinese drones while minimizing their risk. LEDA leads training on drone operation and best practices for public safety and law enforcement. All 30 of the drones the group uses for training are made by Chinese companies. 'Generally speaking, over 90% of public safety agencies in the nation and worldwide today are utilizing Chinese aircraft,' Karr said. 'So in the event that a bill like this would go fully through and would potentially ban the use of Chinese drones for public safety, it'd be catastrophic for the public safety drone industry.' The biggest advantage of Chinese drones is their low cost, especially when compared with American models. Karr told VOA that he'd rather use American products, but that domestically produced drones were double the price of those made in China and included more maintenance fees. 'There's not a law enforcement entity across the United States that would rather fly a Chinese aircraft over an American if they were competitively priced,' he said. In addition to LEDA, the California Fire Chiefs Association, the Air Public Safety Association and other groups have written to Congress saying the bill will harm them, with most citing concerns over cost. In an interview with VOA in August, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called Chinese drones 'a huge vulnerability,' and said that data security regulations would not address the security risks of Chinese drones given their frequent software updates. People 'just want drones, and these are the cheapest ones they can find,' said Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state in the next administration. 'We need to help incentivize the development of alternative manufacturers that are cost effective for law enforcement, for utility companies, for others.' DJI has not yet responded to VOA's request for comment on the latest version of the NDAA, which could ban the company's drones. However, when votes were taken to include a ban of DJI drones in the NDAA in the House of Representatives earlier this year, DJI representatives told VOA that the moves 'suggest protectionism and undermine the principles of fair competition and an open market.' 'Our drones have enabled the growth of entire industries, empowering small businesses in sectors such as agriculture, real estate, and transportation. These businesses depend on the accessibility of DJI's drone technology to thrive. We believe that innovation, security, and privacy can coexist and are essential to advancing the drone industry and the interests of all stakeholders,' wrote DJI representatives. DJI has consistently denied claims that it sends drone data to the Chinese government.

Congo files criminal complaints against Apple in Europe over conflict minerals	Paris — The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints against Apple subsidiaries in France and Belgium, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain, lawyers for the Congolese government told Reuters. Congo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres of civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to U.N. experts and human rights groups. Apple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability. Apple last year said it had 'no reasonable basis for concluding' its products contain illegally exported minerals from conflict-hit zones. The tech giant has insisted it carefully verifies the origin of materials in its output. Its 2023 filing on conflict minerals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said none of the smelters or refiners of 3T minerals or gold in its supply chain had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighboring countries. But international lawyers representing Congo argue that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, which they say renders the firm complicit in crimes taking place in Congo. In parallel complaints filed to the Paris prosecutor's office and to a Belgian investigating magistrate's office on Monday, Congo accuses local subsidiaries Apple France, Apple Retail France and Apple Retail Belgium of a range of offenses. These include covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean. 'It is clear that the Apple group, Apple France and Apple Retail France know very well that their minerals supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing,' says the French complaint, after citing U.N. and rights reports on conflict in east Congo. Belgium had a particular moral duty to act because looting of Congo's resources began during the 19th-century colonial rule of its King Leopold II, Congo's Belgian lawyer Christophe Marchand said. 'It is incumbent on Belgium to help Congo in its effort to use judicial means to end the pillaging,' he said. The complaints, prepared by the lawyers on behalf of Congo's justice minister, make allegations not just against the local subsidiaries but against the Apple group as a whole. France and Belgium were chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability. Judicial authorities in both nations will decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges. In an unrelated case in March, a U.S. federal court rejected an attempt by private plaintiffs to hold Apple, Google, Tesla, Dell and Microsoft accountable for what the plaintiffs described as their dependence on child labor in Congolese cobalt mines. Minerals fuel violence Since the 1990s, Congo's mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some backed by neighboring Rwanda, and the Congolese military. Millions of civilians have died and been displaced. Competition for minerals is one of the main drivers of conflict as armed groups sustain themselves and buy weapons with the proceeds of exports, often smuggled via Rwanda, according to U.N. experts and human rights organizations. Rwanda denies benefiting from the trade, dismissing the allegations as unfounded. Among the appendices to Congo's legal complaint in France was a statement issued by the U.S. State Department in July, expressing concerns about the role of the illicit trade in minerals from Congo, including tantalum, in financing conflict. The statement was a response to requests from the private sector for the U.S. government to clarify potential risks associated with manufacturing products using minerals extracted, transported or exported from eastern Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Congo's complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring and certification scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on suppliers of 3T minerals exported from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Congo's lawyers argue that ITSCI has been discredited, including by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) of which Apple is a member, and that Apple nevertheless uses ITSCI as a fig leaf to falsely present its supply chain as clean. The RMI, whose members include more than 500 companies, announced in 2022 it was removing ITSCI from its list of approved traceability schemes. In July, it said it was prolonging the suspension until at least 2026, saying ITSCI had not provided field observations from high-risk sites or explained how it was responding to an escalation of violence in North Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and is a key 3T mining area. ITSCI criticized the RMI's own processes and defended its work in Congo as reliable. It has also rejected allegations in a 2022 report by campaigning group Global Witness entitled 'The ITSCI Laundromat,' cited in Congo's legal complaint in France, that it was complicit in the false labeling of minerals from conflict zones as coming from mines located in peaceful areas. Apple mentioned ITSCI five times in its 2023 filing on conflict minerals. The filing also made multiple mentions of the RMI, in which Apple said it had continued active participation and leadership but did not mention the RMI's ditching of ITSCI. In its July statement, the U.S. State Department said flaws in traceability schemes have not garnered sufficient engagement and attention to lead to changes needed. Robert Amsterdam, a U.S.-based lawyer for Congo, said the French and Belgian complaints were the first criminal complaints by the Congolese state against a major tech company, describing them as a 'first salvo' only. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-files-criminal-complaints-against-apple-in-europe-over-conflict-minerals-/7905254.html	2024-12-17T16:50:50-08:00	
Congress nears funding deal with more than $100 billion in disaster aid	WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders are nearing the unveiling of a spending agreement that will keep the federal government funded through March 14 and provide more than $100 billion in emergency aid to help states and local communities recover from Hurricanes Helene and Milton and other natural disasters. The stopgap measure would prevent a partial government shutdown set to begin after midnight Friday. It would kick final decisions on this budget year's spending levels to a new Republican-led Congress and President-elect Donald Trump. The continuing resolution generally continues current spending levels for agencies. Passage of the measure is one of the final actions that lawmakers will consider this week before adjourning for the holidays and making way for the next Congress. It's the second short-term funding measure the lawmakers have taken up this fall as they struggled to pass the dozen annual appropriations bills before the new fiscal year began October 1, as they typically do. While text of the legislation was not yet available Tuesday, House Republican lawmakers emerged from a closed-door meeting saying that the disaster aid would come to about $100 billion, plus there's $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers who have been struggling with drought in some regions of the country and flooding in others. 'We have to be able to help those who are in these dire straits,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters. Net farm income is projected to decline 4.1% this year after falling 19.4% the year before from the record highs reached in 2022. Johnson indicated more farm aid could be delivered in the next Congress, saying, 'We can't do all it right now.' 'Congress is doing the best it can under difficult circumstances, and I think it will be a big boost for the industry,' Johnson said. Representative Glenn Thompson, the Republican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said he was hoping for more economic relief for farmers, but 'it's a great start.' 'I think it's going to send the right signal to the markets that most farmers and ranchers are going to be able to get eligible for the credit they need to borrow in order to plant a crop or raise a herd,' Thompson said. President Joe Biden has sought about $114 billion in disaster aid, submitting a $99 billion request in November, telling lawmakers the funding was 'urgently needed.' The administration subsequently updated its request to include funding to repair federal facilities damaged due to natural disasters. As it typically does, Congress is expected to act just before another shutdown deadline. House Republicans generally give lawmakers 72 hours to review text of the legislation, which would push a vote on final passage to Friday if they follow through on that rule. The Senate also is not known for acting speedily, but many lawmakers are eager to adjourn for the year and make way for the next Congress. Since the bill is the last must-pass legislation of the current Congress, lawmakers have worked to get certain priorities included. On the health care front, the legislation seeks to extend coverage of telehealth appointments for Medicare enrollees and rein in how much money pharmacy benefits managers — the companies that negotiate how and what drugs are covered by insurance plans — make off those deals. Johnson said he hoped that text of the bill would be available later Tuesday, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that 'negotiations continue between both parties.' 'Obviously we are getting closer to the December 20th deadline, so time is of the essence for Republicans to reach an agreement with us that we can act on quickly,' Schumer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-nears-funding-deal-with-more-than-100-billion-in-disaster-aid-/7905246.html	2024-12-17T16:31:59-08:00

Overcrowded boat capsizes in Congo; at least 25 dead, dozens missing	KINSHASA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — An overcrowded boat capsized on a river in central Congo on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people, including children, and leaving dozens missing, officials and local residents said. The vessel was believed to have more than 100 passengers on board after leaving from the town of Inongo, northeast of the capital of Kinshasa. It capsized a few hundred meters into the journey along the Fimi River, the latest such tragedy to strike Congo. A search for the missing was underway hours later Tuesday as concerns rose that the death toll could be far higher. 'There was overloading at roof level and, as far as the lifeless human bodies are concerned, at least 25 have been recovered so far,' said David Kalemba, Inongo's river commissioner. The capsized boat was also loaded with goods, according to Alex Mbumba, a resident of the area. 'Among the dead are children, but it's difficult to give an exact death toll at the moment as ... the boat had a lot of passengers,' said Mbumba. Tuesday's wreck was the fourth this year in the Maï-Ndombe province, a region surrounded by rivers and where many rely on river transportation. Congolese officials have often warned against overloading and vowed to punish those violating safety measures for water transportation. However, in remote areas where most passengers come from, many are unable to afford public transport for the few available roads. At least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country's east, and 80 lost their lives in June in a similar accident near Kinshasa. The latest accident prompted calls for the government to equip the province with flotation devices. 'The government must act to improve safety on the waters of our province [because] navigation conditions are dangerous,' said Mbumba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/overcrowded-boat-capsizes-in-congo-at-least-25-dead-dozens-missing-/7904979.html	2024-12-17T15:24:38-08:00	
US lawmakers propose bills to hit China over fentanyl trade	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday proposed three bills aimed at cracking down on China's role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis, with measures that would set up a U.S. task force to disrupt narcotics trafficking and pave the way for sanctions on Chinese entities. China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican cartels to produce fentanyl, while Chinese money launderers have become key players in the international drug trade, U.S. authorities say. The proposed legislation would help hold China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) accountable for 'directly fueling the fentanyl crisis through its state subsidies of precursors,' said the House of Representatives' Select Committee on China, on which all of the sponsors of the bills sit. One bill, The CCP Fentanyl Sanctions Act, introduced by Democratic Representative Jake Auchincloss, would codify authorities for the U.S. to cut off Chinese companies from the U.S. banking system, including vessels, ports and online marketplaces that 'knowingly or recklessly' facilitate shipment of illicit synthetic narcotics. 'This is state-sponsored poisoning of the American people,' Auchincloss said at an event introducing the legislation. 'The genesis of this is squarely on the mainland of the People's Republic of China.' Two other bills would create a task force of U.S. agencies to conduct joint operations to disrupt trafficking networks and allow for the imposition of civil penalties on Chinese entities that fail to properly manifest or follow formal entry channels when shipping precursors to the U.S., the committee said. There is growing consensus in Republican circles close to President-elect Donald Trump that Beijing has exploited, even engineered, the synthetic opioid epidemic to harm Americans, something Beijing denies. China says it has some of the strictest drug laws in the world, and that the U.S. needs to curb narcotics demand at home. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bills. With little time remaining in the current congressional term, the bills would likely need to be reintroduced next year after the new Congress is sworn in on January 3. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the committee, wrote in an article this month that it was 'time to get tough' on Beijing over fentanyl.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-propose-bills-to-hit-china-over-fentanyl-trade-/7904949.html	2024-12-17T15:01:45-08:00	
Unknown disease in Congo revealed to be severe malaria, health authorities say	KINSHASA — Democratic Republic of Congo's Health Ministry said on Tuesday that a previously unidentified disease circulating in the southwestern Kwango province is a severe form of malaria. Earlier this month, local authorities said the disease had killed 143 people in the country's Panzi health zone in November. The symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body aches. 'The mystery has finally been solved. It's a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,' the Health Ministry said in a statement, adding that malnutrition in the area had weakened the local population, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. The statement also said that 592 cases had been reported since October, with a fatality rate of 6.2%. Provincial health minister Apollinaire Yumba told Reuters that anti-malaria medicine provided by the World Health Organization was being distributed in the main hospital and health centers in the Panzi health zone. A WHO spokesperson said more health kits for moderate and critical cases were due to arrive on Wednesday. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that 10 early samples from patients in Congo suffering from a mystery illness had tested positive for malaria, but that he had not ruled out the possibility that they suffered from other concurrent diseases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unknown-disease-in-congo-revealed-to-be-severe-malaria-health-authorities-say/7904952.html	2024-12-17T15:00:05-08:00	
Storm Chido kills at least 7, leaves trail of damage in Malawi	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — The storm named Chido killed at least seven people in Malawi and affected more than 30,000 others, disaster officials said Tuesday. A preliminary assessment report released by Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs said the storm blew off the roofs of schools, health facilities and houses. Department spokesperson Chipiliro Khamula said at least 7,721 households representing 34,741 people were affected. Three people died in Salima district. Kasungu, Machinga, Blantyre and Lilongwe districts each recorded one death. Khamula also said the department recorded 16 injuries. Tropical Cyclone Chido developed northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean and made landfall Sunday near Nacala, Mozambique, where it caused significant damage. A report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released Tuesday said the storm affected more than 174,000 people in Mozambique and 64,000 in the Comoros archipelago, destroying thousands of homes. Chido’s remnants passed Malawi on Monday as a moderate tropical storm causing heavy rains and flooding in about 17 districts, many of them in the south. Lucy Mtilatila, director for the Malawi Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, told VOA Tuesday the storm had dissipated. 'Our eyes are on the Indian Ocean in case there will be another development,' she said. 'But so far, so good.' School classes resumed after the government suspended them Sunday as a precautionary measure. Khamula said the disaster agency has withdrawn all search and rescue teams it had deployed in at-risk areas. The agency, in collaboration with other humanitarian partners, is facilitating relief efforts to assist affected households, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-chido-kills-at-least-7-leaves-trail-of-damage-in-malawi/7904928.html	2024-12-17T14:37:25-08:00	
Kenyan aid group is enabling refugees to access loans	NAIROBI, KENYA — A Kenyan aid group is helping refugees improve their lives by providing affordable loans that will help finance their businesses. At least 13,000 refugees in exile have received loans. Adelle Mubalama, a tailor at Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp, fled her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019. Mubalama said she abandoned her business selling clothing, and her efforts to get funds to begin a new trade in exile was futile. 'If you want to borrow money from the bank, they would ask you for statements and the Kenya Revenue Authority PIN number,' she said, 'which is very hard for us refugees to get.'' Mubalama said her dream came alive when she was granted a loan from Inkomoko, an organization that helps to empower micro and small business entrepreneurs, including refugees in Africa. She now makes bags and sells fabrics in Kakuma. After an assessment, Mubalama went through training for running a business. She then got a loan of 30,000 shillings, which she used to launch her business. At least 13,000 refugees in Kenya have received loans from Inkomoko, which means 'origin' in Nyarwanda. But according to a 2024 World Bank report, despite the significant progress Kenya has made in developing a policy framework for refugees and host communities, refugees continue to face challenges in accessing services to improve their lives. Inkomoko founder Julienne Oyler said entrepreneurs can access up to $50,000 and pay back at an interest rate of 10% annually – lower than what most banks charge, and without collateral. Oyler said that with the loans, many refugees see their skills and talents revived. ''The system that was established to support refugees is completely outdated, humanitarian funding is incredibly declining, while the number of displaced people is increasing,' Oyler said. 'What we see is that the old way of working isn't working. It's when we bring in private sector solutions into these communities that we actually start to see economic development.' The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that at the end of June 2024, 122.6 million people worldwide remained forcibly displaced due to disasters, persecution, conflicts, violence and human rights violations, among others. This represents an increase of 5%, or 5.3 million people, compared to the end of 2023. International Organization of Migrants senior program manager Pravina Gurung told VOA that climate-induced disasters are adding to the growing numbers of displaced individuals and are destroying livelihoods. ''When people are on the move in search of safety and better livelihood opportunities, there is a risk of exploitation,' Gurung said. 'And without documentation, they cannot access any kind of services, including financial services. Also, they cannot access any type of assistance that is in existence.'' Kenya hosts over 1 million international migrants, according to IOM, and nearly 800,000 registered refugees. Officials believe initiatives to help them access affordable financing will help improve their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-aid-group-is-enabling-refugees-to-access-loans-/7904929.html	2024-12-17T14:33:55-08:00	
Trump sues Des Moines Register, pollster for 'election interference' after inaccurate poll	President-elect Donald Trump sued the Des Moines Register and its pollster for 'brazen election interference' in publishing a survey the weekend before the election that showed Democrat Kamala Harris with a surprising lead of 3 percentage points in the state. The Register's parent Gannett Co. on Tuesday dismissed the lawsuit as meritless and said it would vigorously defend its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit continues the president-elect's campaign against media outlets he feels have wronged him. ABC this past weekend agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library in order to settle a defamation lawsuit against George Stephanopoulos for inaccurately saying Trump had been found civilly liable for rape. The Des Moines survey, done by since-retired pollster J. Ann Selzer, was considered shocking for indicating that an earlier Trump lead in the Republican-leaning Midwestern state had been erased. In the actual election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points. 'There was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,' the lawsuit said. 'It was election-interfering fiction.' The poll increased enthusiasm among Democrats, compelled Republicans to divert campaign time and money to areas in which they were ahead, and deceived the public into thinking Democrats were doing better than they actually were, Trump charged. The lawsuit was filed late Monday in Polk County district court in Iowa. It cites Iowa consumer fraud law, and doesn't ask for specific monetary damages, but rather wants a trial jury to award triple the amount of what it determines actual damages to be. Whatever happens legally, the case could have a chilling effect beyond Iowa. Trump said in legal papers that he wanted it to deter 'radicals from continuing to act with corrupt intent in releasing polls manufactured for the purpose of skewing election results in favor of Democrats.' Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said the newspaper acknowledged the pre-election poll did not reflect actual results and released technical information to explain the data and what went wrong. 'We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,' she said. Selzer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But she told PBS in Iowa last week that 'it's not my ethic' to set up a poll to deliver a specific response. She said she was mystified about what motivation people would think she had.

Archivist: Equal Rights Amendment can't be certified as Democrats push Biden to recognize it	Washington — In a rare joint statement, the archivist and deputy archivist of the United States said Tuesday that the 1970s-era Equal Rights Amendment cannot be certified without further action by Congress or the courts, as Democrats press President Joe Biden to act unilaterally on its ratification before he leaves office next month. The five-decade push to amend the Constitution to prohibit discrimination based on sex remains stalled. Congress sent the amendment, which guarantees men and women equal rights under the law, to the states in 1972 and gave states seven years to ratify it, later extending the deadline to 1982. But the amendment wasn't ratified by the required three-quarters of states before the deadline. Four years ago, however, Virginia lawmakers voted to ratify the amendment, becoming the 38th and final state needed — albeit nearly four decades after the congressionally mandated deadline for ratification. More than 120 House Democrats, led by Representatives Cori Bush and Ayanna Pressley, called on Biden on Sunday to direct the archivist to certify and publish the amendment despite the missed deadline. 'Solidifying your legacy on equal rights with a final action on the ERA would be a defining moment for the historic Biden-Harris administration and your presidency,' they wrote to Biden. But the archivist, Colleen Shogan, and her deputy, William J. Bosanko, who are responsible for certifying and publishing new amendments once they meet the required ratification threshold, say neither they nor Biden can act without Congress or the courts lifting the deadline. 'In 2020 and again in 2022, the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice affirmed that the ratification deadline established by Congress for the ERA is valid and enforceable,' they said in a joint statement. 'The OLC concluded that extending or removing the deadline requires new action by Congress or the courts. Court decisions at both the District and Circuit levels have affirmed that the ratification deadlines established by Congress for the ERA are valid.' They added: 'Therefore, the Archivist of the United States cannot legally publish the Equal Rights Amendment. As the leaders of the National Archives, we will abide by these legal precedents and support the constitutional framework in which we operate.' Congress tried last year in the latest push to lift the deadline to allow for the amendment's ratification, but the measure didn't reach the required 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who is leading the effort among Democrats in the Senate, insisted in a statement that the archivist's analysis was flawed and said she was 'wrongfully inserting herself into a clear constitutional process, despite the fact that her role is purely ministerial.' She encouraged Biden to ignore the OLC memo and certify the ERA anyway. 'OLC memos are advisory in nature and can easily be disregarded by the current administration,' she said. The Biden White House has been discussing the possibility with lawmakers and in internal meetings, according to a person familiar with the matter, but believes the best path forward is for Congress to lift the deadline and thereby eliminate the risk of a legal challenge to the amendment. White House spokesperson Kelly Scully said: 'President Biden has been clear that he wants to see the Equal Rights Amendment definitively enshrined in the Constitution.' 'Senior administration officials have and will continue to engage with key Congressional leaders and other stakeholders on this issue in the weeks ahead,' she added. 'It is long past time that we recognize the clear will of the American people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/archivist-equal-rights-amendment-can-t-be-certified-as-democrats-push-biden-to-recognize-it-/7904905.html	2024-12-17T14:17:53-08:00	
First winner of FIFA’s Marta Award? Marta, of course	DOHA, QATAR — It could only have been her. Marta won the inaugural FIFA award for the best goal in women's soccer — named after the Brazil great. The 38-year-old was given the Marta Award at FIFA's 'The Best' awards on Tuesday for her goal for Brazil in an international friendly against Jamaica in June. Prior to this year, the Puskas award covered all of soccer but it was decided to award it to the best goal in the men's game — won this year by Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho — and create the new Marta Award for the women's game. 'To compete against so many great players — we had some fantastic goals,' she said. 'It's been a wonderful season, too. But I'm even happier to receive an award that bears my name; this is undoubtedly the greatest honor.' Marta is widely regarded as the greatest female soccer player of all time and had won the award for the women's player of the year on a record six occasions. She scored a record 119 goals for Brazil in 185 appearances for her country, spanning six World Cups and six Olympics, before retiring from international soccer after the Paris Games — where Brazil lost to the United States in the final. Marta won the first NWSL title of her career last month when Orlando Pride beat Washington Spirit 1-0 in the final. She had scored in the semifinal. Marta was asked the day before the title match if she thought it was possible she might give the award to herself. 'You guys need to decide, because who votes for the best goal in the year? It's you. It's the people in the public. So it should be really interesting, like Marta's Award goes to Marta!' she said with a laugh. The Marta Award was voted for by fans and a panel of FIFA legends.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-winner-of-fifa-s-marta-award-marta-of-course-/7904902.html	2024-12-17T14:15:48-08:00	
Suspect in killing of US insurance CEO charged with murder as act of terrorism	NEW YORK — The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare's CEO has been charged with murder as an act of terrorism, prosecutors said Tuesday as they worked to bring him to a New York court from a Pennsylvania jail. Luigi Mangione already was charged with murder in the Dec. 4 killing of Brian Thompson, but the terror allegation is new. Under New York law, such a charge can be brought when an alleged crime is 'intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policies of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion and affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping.' Mangione's New York lawyer has not commented on the case. Thompson, 50, was shot dead as he walked to a Manhattan hotel where Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare — the United States' biggest medical insurer — was holding an investor conference. 'This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation,' Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at a news conference Tuesday. 'It occurred in one of the most bustling parts of our city, threatened the safety of local residents and tourists alike, commuters and businesspeople just starting out on their day.' After days of intense police searches and publicity, Mangione was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and arrested. New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun used to kill Thompson, a passport and various fake IDs, including one that the suspected shooter presented to check into a New York hostel. The 26-year-old was charged with Pennsylvania gun and forgery offenses and locked up there without bail. His Pennsylvania lawyer has questioned the evidence for the forgery charge and the legal grounding for the gun charge. The attorney also has said Mangione would fight extradition to New York. Mangione has two court hearings scheduled for Thursday in Pennsylvania, including an extradition hearing, Bragg said. Hours after his arrest, the Manhattan district attorney's office filed paperwork charging him with murder and other offenses. The indictment builds on that paperwork. Investigators' working theory is that Mangione, an Ivy League computer science grad from a prominent Maryland family, was propelled by anger at the U.S. health care system. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that when arrested, he was carrying a handwritten letter that called health insurance companies 'parasitic' and complained about corporate greed. Mangione repeatedly posted on social media about how spinal surgery last year had eased his chronic back pain, encouraging people with similar conditions to speak up for themselves if told they just had to live with it. In a Reddit post in late April, he advised someone with a back problem to seek additional opinions from surgeons and, if necessary, say the pain made it impossible to work. 'We live in a capitalist society,' Mangione wrote. 'I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.' He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer. Mangione apparently cut himself off from his family and close friends in recent months. His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November. Thompson, who grew up on a farm in Iowa, was trained as an accountant. A married father of two high-schoolers, he had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. His killing kindled a fiery outpouring of resentment toward U.S. health insurance companies, as Americans swapped stories online and elsewhere of being denied coverage, left in limbo as doctors and insurers disagreed, and stuck with sizeable bills.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-in-killing-of-us-insurance-ceo-charged-with-murder-as-act-of-terrorism/7904904.html	2024-12-17T14:04:24-08:00

Press freedom continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong	Washington — Jailed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai testified Tuesday that the Hong Kong government became 'very strict' after Beijing's national security law came into effect in 2020. The 77-year-old British national made the statement when the court asked him to explain comments he made in August 2020 following the arrest of pro-democracy former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting. At the time, Lai said the arrest showed that the Beijing-imposed national security law, or NSL, 'definitely had destroyed our rule of law.' Lam was found guilty of rioting last week. 'I think the NSL has, you know, affected the way … the government conducted the law,' Lai told the court Tuesday. 'After the NSL, the government has been very strict in using the law.' The founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper stands accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under Beijing's national security law. He rejects the charges, which press freedom groups have decried as politically motivated. 'The trial is entirely a sham,' Yaqiu Wang, the China research director at the nonprofit Freedom House, told VOA. Lai's plight is a feature, not a bug, of the current press freedom landscape in Hong Kong, according to analysts. The past year has been particularly devastating for media freedom in a place that was once considered a bastion of press freedom in Asia, say analysts, who point to Lai's trial, a new national security law, and other trials of journalists as evidence that the media landscape has continued to deteriorate in Hong Kong. 'It's just the continuation of a dramatic decline in press freedom in Hong Kong,' Wang said. Next year is unlikely to be any better, multiple experts told VOA. Lai's trial began in December 2023 and was initially expected to last about 80 days. But now, his year is set to end the same way it began: attending hearings for a trial that could sentence him to life in prison. Sebastien Lai, the son of Jimmy Lai, has consistently voiced concern about his father's health. The elder Lai has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. 'His health has gotten much worse, as you can expect when you put a 77-year-old man in solitary confinement for four years. But his spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien Lai told VOA in November. Lai's case is intended to scare other people in Hong Kong from criticizing the government, says Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the head of Lai's international legal team. 'His case was also designed to send a chill down the spine of anyone who might want to wear a T-shirt or sing a song or post a tweet or say anything which might stand up to Hong Kong or Beijing's leaders,' Gallagher said at a November press conference in Washington. In late November, a Hong Kong government spokesperson told VOA it was 'inappropriate' to comment on Lai's case because legal proceedings are ongoing. Hong Kong authorities have previously denied that Lai's trial is unfair. The spokesperson also said Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system' and emphasized that 'Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech.' When it comes to press freedom in Hong Kong, Lai's trial is part of a broader pattern. In August, two editors — Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam — at the now-shuttered Stand News were convicted of sedition and later sentenced to prison. Like Lai's, that case was also viewed as a bellwether of the poor state of press freedom in Hong Kong, according to Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The cases 'are a very clear message across the board to journalists that they cannot expect the protections of law to guarantee their free speech rights in order to practice journalism without fear of reprisal,' Richardson told VOA. In November, 45 pro-democracy activists were sentenced to prison under the national security law. And in September, the Hong Kong Journalists Association reported that dozens of Hong Kong journalists and their families had faced harassment since June. 'You're not safe if you cross the government,' Mark Clifford, who recently published a biography on Jimmy Lai, told VOA. Those developments have taken place against the backdrop of a new, homegrown national security law known as Article 23, which expands on Beijing's national security measure. Enacted in March, Article 23 covers treason, sedition and state secrets, and allows for trials to be held behind closed doors. Experts have warned the law will likely further the deterioration of press freedom and other civil liberties in Hong Kong. 'Almost any conduct can now be labeled as a threat to national security,' said Richardson, the former China director at Human Rights Watch. Wang said the law may also underscore insecurity on the part of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. 'They feel the need to take out more tools to repress people,' Wang said. In 2019, before Beijing's national security law was enacted, Hong Kong ranked 73 out of 180 countries on the Global Press Freedom Index. In 2024, it ranked 135 — a more than 60-spot drop. That rapid decline in press freedom and broader civil liberties has fundamentally changed the identity of Hong Kong, whose population long celebrated their freedoms, according to Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong. 'It's surreal. It's traumatic,' Clifford said. 'I don't think we've seen another country or another city in the past 100 years that has seen its freedom so quickly and thoroughly and comprehensively snuffed out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-continues-to-deteriorate-in-hong-kong/7904843.html	2024-12-17T13:00:17-08:00	
VOA interview: US urges Europe to end energy dependency on Russia	The outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden plans in its final weeks to 'continue tightening the noose' around Russia's key energy exports with new sanctions to deprive Moscow of revenue for its war on Ukraine, according to Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey Pyatt. Pyatt over the past two weeks has traveled in Europe and Asia to discuss energy security with allies and the G7+Ukraine energy resilience group. In an interview with VOA Ukrainian's Oksana Bedratenko, Pyatt said Europe should use the Dec. 31 expiration of a gas transit contract between Ukraine and Russia to decisively end its dependency on Russian energy. He said he is encouraged that Europe sees American liquid natural gas (LNG) as part of its energy solution, noting that countries in Europe and even Japan — which imports 10% of its gas from Russia — understand the need to find alternative energy suppliers. The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: Over recent weeks Russia staged several massive attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector. With all of the preparations, with all of the help from Ukraine's allies before winter, what is your assessment of Ukrainian energy sector resilience? Assistant Secretary of State Geoffrey Pyatt: We knew coming into this winter that this was going to be a very fragile period, but I think the good news is support for Ukraine, support for Ukrainian energy workers, is as strong as it's ever been. We saw another brutal attack on Friday, especially in western Ukraine, in Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk. … And this is the bitterest part of the winter. So we know we need to continue to work together. I've just returned from two weeks of travel. I was in Tokyo and before that I was in Paris and London. The message I heard consistently from all of our G7 partners was a very clear focus on doing everything we can to help ensure that Russia's attempt to weaponize the winter is a failure. VOA: The gas transit contract between Russia and Ukraine expires at the end of this year. Do you think Europe is ready for it? There has already been some pressure on Ukraine to continue the gas transit. Do you think this will actually be the end of Europe's dependency on Russian gas? Pyatt: I certainly hope so. And importantly, the pressure that I see is only coming from one or two countries. I was very glad to see the statements over the weekend from the new [EU] Energy Commissioner [Dan] Jorgensen making very clear the need to make progress on gas phaseout, on nuclear, on all forms of dependency on Russian energy, in line with the EU goal of getting to zero by 2027. Obviously, Brussels and Kyiv need to make some decisions in the next couple of weeks. But I think long-term it is very clear that the energy and gas trade in particular has been the principal vector of Russian influence on the Ukrainian economy since independence. So why on earth would anybody be interested in extending that relationship? VOA: Europe has been buying more LNG from Russia. Are there any plans to have more sanctions on Russian LNG projects? Pyatt: We welcome Europe's steps. Just today [Dec. 15], the 15th sanctions package, which is quite substantial. I have said publicly on a couple of occasions recently that there will be more coming from the Biden administration. I'm very confident of that. And we're working very hard to maintain alignment between Washington, Brussels, London. That's part of what I was doing in Europe two weeks ago. Everybody's pace of operations is slightly different. ... I was glad to see Commissioner Jorgensen also talk about the important role of American LNG as part of Europe's energy solution. So, I'm very confident that we are going to continue to tighten the noose. We're going to do everything that we can to drive down [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's energy revenues, which go to pay for the North Korean missiles and the Russian drones that are destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure every day of the week. VOA: When we look into the next year, the U.S. support for Ukraine might go down. Do you think that Europe and other allies are ready to step up and continue supporting Ukrainian energy? Pyatt: Everybody is already stepping up. As I think you saw Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken just signed with [Ukrainian] Foreign Minister [Andrii] Sybiha a second energy [Memorandum of Understanding]. This is for the implementation of $825 million in additional energy sector assistance just from the United States. … That very high level of U.S. assistance is exceeded by the assistance that has come from the other G7-plus partners. This is a really important point that it's not just the United States that's providing this assistance, and in fact, the majority of assistance in the energy sector has come from the other G7-plus countries. VOA: In the MOU there's a lot of attention going to the protection of Ukrainian companies from political influence. How important are reforms in Ukraine even during the war? Pyatt: Well, as you know, I've been working on these reform issues for 10 years now. So I can appreciate the progress that has been achieved, and that progress is real. Look for instance at the improved production numbers at Naftogaz. Maybe that improved production is because of better management; maybe it's because production that was previously skimmed off is now being declared transparently. But either way, it's a positive outcome. There's more that needs to be done. … Ukraine will not become a member of the European Union in one day, but I think fulfilling the aspirations that the Ukrainian people expressed during the revolution of dignity, when I was ambassador in Kyiv, is as important today as it's ever been, and aligning Ukraine's energy sector with the highest European and OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) standards is very much part and parcel of that larger process of becoming a member of the EU.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-us-urges-europe-to-end-energy-dependency-on-russia/7904825.html	2024-12-17T12:56:48-08:00

IT consultant found guilty in San Francisco stabbing death of Cash App founder	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A San Francisco jury on Tuesday found a tech consultant guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee, which carries a sentence of 16 years to life. Jurors took seven days to deliver their verdict against Nima Momeni in the April 4, 2023, death of Lee, a beloved tech mogul who was found staggering on a deserted downtown street, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. Lee, 43, later died at a hospital. 'We think justice was done here today,' the victim's brother, Tim Oliver Lee, told reporters. 'What matters today is that we had a guilty verdict and Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.' Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times with a knife he took from his sister's kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her. But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and said he didn't realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even hurt. The case has drawn national attention, partly given Lee's status in the tech world. Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023, when he was charged with murder in the first degree. Jurors received the case, which started Oct. 14, on Dec. 4. Lee had created mobile payment service Cash App and was the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin when he died. He had moved to Miami from the San Francisco Bay Area, where his ex-wife Krista Lee lives with their two children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/it-consultant-found-guilty-in-stabbing-death-of-cash-app-founder/7904653.html	2024-12-17T10:48:59-08:00	
Damaged Russian ships spill estimated 3,700 tons of oil in Kerch Strait, state media say	MOSCOW — An estimated 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil had spilled into the Kerch Strait after two Russian ships were seriously damaged by stormy weather, Russian state media reported Monday. The two ships, the Volgoneft-239 and the Volgoneft-212, were transporting roughly 9,200 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Social media footage from the scene showed a black liquid rising among the waves. Preliminary estimates say that 3,700 tons of mazut leaked into the sea, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti reported, citing an unnamed source. In a statement, the leader of Russia’s nearby Krasnodar region, Governor Veniamin Kondratev, said that the oil had not yet reached the shore. An emergency rescue operation was launched Sunday after the Volgoneft-212 tanker ran aground and had its bow torn away in storm conditions, Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry said. One sailor in the 13-man crew died, officials said. A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also left damaged and adrift with 14 crewmembers on board. It later ran aground 80 meters from shore, close to the port of Taman in Russia’s Krasnodar region, from where the sailors were later rescued. Russian officials confirmed the oil spill Sunday, but they said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent. In a statement, Greenpeace Ukraine said they will monitor the situation. The charity has had no presence in Russia since 2023, when it was designated as an 'undesirable organization' by the Russian government. 'Any oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,' said Dr. Paul Johnston, head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, based at the University of Exeter in the U.K. 'It is likely to be driven by prevailing wind and currents and in the current weather conditions (it) is likely to be extremely difficult to contain. If it is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up.' The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the oil spill as a 'large-scale environmental disaster' of the war and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers. 'The accidents on two rusty vessels in the Kerch Strait resulted in another large-scale environmental disaster of our war. Thousands of tons of fuel oil spilled from the Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, causing tragic damage to the natural systems of the Azov and Black Seas,' he wrote in a post Monday on social media platform X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/damaged-russian-ships-spill-estimated-3-700-tons-of-oil-in-kerch-strait-state-media-say-/7904652.html	2024-12-17T10:48:29-08:00

The head of the country’s disaster management agency says the numbers are preliminary, as rescue teams search through rubble. After visiting the affected areas late Monday, the chair of Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction, Luisa Meque, said around 2.5 million people were affected by the cyclone. Several districts in Cabo Delgado province, including the capital Pemba, were hit hard by the cyclone, and teams on the ground are reporting significant damage. The cyclone made landfall Sunday in Mecufi, a district in the province of Cabo Delgado, and destruction in the area was near total, with 100% of homes damaged and very few structures still standing. Canjar Amade told VOA via WhatsApp that he lived through the cyclone tearing apart his house. He said the wind took the sheets off during the night, and the house fell down Monday morning. Meteorologist Acacio Tembe from the national weather agency said the provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, as well as other parts of Mozambique, are still getting hit by remnants of the storm, including rains and strong winds. The system, which also hit Malawi and the island of Mayotte, is expected to dissipate near Zimbabwe by late Tuesday. Mozambique is considered one of the countries most severely affected by global climate change. During the rainy season, which runs from October to April, it experiences cyclical floods and tropical cyclones. Experts say with a potential La Nina effect in southern Africa in early 2025, the frequency and intensity of heavy rains and tropical cyclones is expected to increase in the Indian Ocean, with floods expected in areas currently affected by drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-chido-kills-at-least-34-in-mozambique/7904521.html	2024-12-17T09:28:31-08:00	
Nigeria investigates nearly 800 suspects arrested in massive cybercrime raid	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, says it is investigating nearly 800 suspects arrested for alleged internet fraud during a massive raid last week in Lagos. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says this is the greatest number of arrests it has ever made during a single raid. EFCC spokesman Wilson Uwujaren told VOA on Tuesday that the raid followed months of intelligence work and surveillance. The 792 suspects, including 193 foreigners, mostly Chinese, were nabbed December 10 in a seven-story building believed to be a 'hustle kingdom' - a place where people are trained to carry out cybercrimes. Uwujaren said the foreigners were recruiting Nigerians there and training them on romance and investment scams targeting victims from North America and Europe. 'For us it's a testament to the fact that we're unrelenting in our efforts to ensure that financial crimes wherever they exist in the country are checked. And then this current operation for us is an eye opener because of the large number of foreigners involved which is an indication that the perception of Nigerians as fraudulent people may not be true. We have a number of foreigners now coming to Nigeria to perpetrate frauds that are ascribed to Nigerians,' he said. The EFCC recovered hundreds of computers, phones and vehicles during the raid. The commission says it is collaborating with international partners to determine whether the suspects are linked to a broader network of internet fraud cells. Cybercrime is a growing problem in Nigeria. In April, a report by a coalition of researchers from the Universities of Oxford and New South Wales ranked Nigeria fifth in the world for cybercrime activities, behind only Russia, Ukraine, China, and the United States. Lack of economic opportunities, inadequate cyber security awareness and poor law enforcement are the reasons the trend is rising in Nigeria, according to cybersecurity analyst Abayomi Adeyanju. 'There are very good IT [information technology] people with skills, and then they graduate from universities, study, get certifications and there are no jobs for them, and they would have to [eat]. I am not one to encourage crime but these people - their skills can be used,' he said. Adeyanju said beyond prosecuting offenders, Nigeria must create more opportunities in the tech sector to significantly curb cybercrimes. 'If we can fix employment issues, these people are not being gainfully used. The skill is just there and so, if they have nothing to eat, the instinct of humans first is survival, so I think the first thing that should be done is that the economy should be fixed and then more employment opportunities be created,' he said. The EFCC said the suspects will be brought into court to face charges in the coming days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-investigates-nearly-800-suspects-arrested-in-massive-cybercrime-raid/7904519.html	2024-12-17T09:27:25-08:00	
EU investigates TikTok over Romanian presidential election	LONDON — European Union regulators said Tuesday they're investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc's digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania's presidential election, which has been thrown into turmoil over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The European Commission is escalating its scrutiny of the popular video-sharing platform after Romania's top court canceled results of the first round of voting that resulted in an unknown far-right candidate becoming the front-runner. The court made its unprecedented decision after authorities in the European Union and NATO member country declassified documents alleging Moscow organized a sprawling social media campaign to promote a long-shot candidate, Calin Georgescu. 'Following serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press release. 'It should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.' The European Commission is the 27-nation European Union's executive arm and enforces the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations intended to clean up social media platforms and protect users from risks such as election-related misinformation. It ordered TikTok earlier this month to retain all information related to the election. In the preliminary round of voting on Nov. 24 Georgescu was an outsider among the 13 candidates but ended up topping the polls. He was due to face a pro-EU reformist rival in a runoff before the court canceled the results. The declassified files alleged that there was an 'aggressive promotion campaign' to boost Georgescu's popularity, including payments worth a total of $381,000 to TikTok influencers to promote him on the platform. TikTok said it has 'protected the integrity' of its platform over 150 elections around the world and is continuing to address these 'industry-wide challenges.' 'TikTok has provided the European Commission with extensive information regarding these efforts, and we have transparently and publicly detailed our robust actions,' it said in a statement. The commission said its investigation will focus on TikTok's content recommendation systems, especially on risks related to 'coordinated inauthentic manipulation or automated exploitation.' It's also looking at TikTok's policies on political advertisements and 'paid-for political content.' TikTok said it doesn't accept paid political ads and 'proactively' removes content for violating policies on misinformation. The investigation could result in TikTok making changes to fix problems or fines worth up to 6% of the company's total global revenue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-investigates-tiktok-over-romanian-presidential-election/7904485.html	2024-12-17T09:02:41-08:00	
US targets North Korean money laundering network with sanctions	Washington — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two people and one entity based in the United Arab Emirates, accusing them of being involved in a network that launders millions of dollars generated by IT workers and cybercrimes to support the North Korean government. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the two people hit with sanctions worked through a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion services that funneled the illicit proceeds back to Pyongyang. North Korea's mission to the United Nations didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Tuesday's action comes as Washington seeks to cut off funding for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, the Treasury said. 'As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs — including through the exploitation of digital assets — Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime,' Treasury Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in the statement. Tuesday's move targeted UAE-based Chinese nationals Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian as well as UAE-based Green Alpine Trading LLC. It freezes any of their U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with sanctions. The Emirati embassy in Washington didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Reuters could not immediately locate contact details for Green Alpine Trading, Lu or Zhang.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-north-korean-money-laundering-network-with-sanctions/7904463.html	2024-12-17T08:35:12-08:00	
Russian lawmakers approve new bill expanding definition of high treason	MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill that broadened the definition of high treason, part of authorities' efforts to tighten control as the fighting in Ukraine is nearing the three-year mark. The amendments approved by the lower house, the State Duma, in second and third readings expand the definition of high treason to include affiliation with any organization involved in 'activities against security of the Russian Federation.' The current legislation has a more narrow interpretation of 'turning to the enemy side,' defining it as joining the enemy's armed forces. Those convicted of high treason could be sentenced to life in prison. 'In the situation when our soldiers are risking their lives in the battle for Russia's sovereignty, there are no 'neutral' or 'peaceful' organizations on the enemy side,' said Vasily Piskarev, head of the Duma's security affairs committee and one of the bill's authors. 'We can't allow anyone to work for the enemy on our territory.' Rights advocates have warned that the bill's vague formulation could be used to target anyone who has ties to any Ukrainian organization and potentially could be interpreted more broadly to also punish those who have any contact with Western organizations or companies. The legal definition of treason already has been expanded to include providing vaguely defined 'assistance' to foreign countries or organizations. The proposed amendments, which also must be approved by the upper house and signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin to become law, also introduce punishment of up to 15 years in prison for foreigners and people without citizenship who are accused of 'assisting enemy activities aimed against security of the Russian Federation.' Treason and espionage cases have skyrocketed after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The cases have targeted a wide range of suspects, from Kremlin critics and independent journalists to scientists, drawing attention from rights groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-lawmakers-approve-new-bill-expanding-definition-of-high-treason/7904450.html	2024-12-17T08:34:05-08:00	
Alabama woman doing well after latest experimental pig kidney transplant	NEW YORK — An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs. Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ — and notably, she isn't as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart. 'It's like a new beginning,' Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, 'the energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney — and to feel it — is unbelievable.' Looney's surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure. Looney is recuperating well after her transplant, which was announced Tuesday. She was discharged from the hospital 11 days after surgery to continue recovery in a nearby apartment although temporarily readmitted this week while her medications are adjusted. Doctors expect her to return home to Alabama in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again. 'To see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,' said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the Nov. 25 transplant. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike. Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later a complication during pregnancy caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It's incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list. But Looney couldn't get a match — she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she'd reject every kidney donors have offered. Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options. The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU's patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died. Those disappointing outcomes didn't dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery. Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: 'You don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.' Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney's new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Moments after Montgomery sewed it into place, the kidney turned a healthy pink and began producing urine. Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up. 'A lot of what we're seeing, we're seeing for the first time,' Montgomery said. During a visit last week with Locke, who now works for the federal government, Looney hugged her longtime doctor, saying, 'Thank you for not giving up on me.' 'Never,' Locke responded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alabama-woman-doing-well-after-latest-experimental-pig-kidney-transplant/7904331.html	2024-12-17T08:12:10-08:00	
Australia deals with Pacific nations aim to curb China’s influence	Taipei, Taiwan — Australia signed two multi-million dollar deals with Nauru and Papua New Guinea last week that analysts say will help Canberra counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific. The deals, which support development in Nauru and pledge to pour hundreds of millions over the next 10 years into the establishment of a rugby team in Papua New Guinea, also give Australia some power to prevent the two island nations from signing security-related deals with China. Beijing has been aggressively expanding its cooperation with islands in the Pacific in recent years, to the concern of Australia, the U.S. and other allies in the region. Under the multi-million dollar deal that Australia signed on December 9 with Nauru, Canberra will offer $89 million to the Pacific Island country over five years, providing key development support in banking, telecommunication, and security. In exchange, Australia can veto any engagements by third countries in the Pacific island country’s security and critical infrastructure sectors. During a signing ceremony at Australia’s Parliament House on December 9, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the agreement as 'a serious responsibility and a sign of the enduring respect between our two nations.' Nauruan President David Adeang said the treaty would help his country, which faces serious financial challenges, strengthen its economy and address critical challenges. Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at Lowy Institute in Australia, says Australia has to make such agreements despite the cost. 'China has an increasing security access to the Pacific, whether through policing, or military land, air or sea assets, and that raises the cost of Australia’s defense posture,' Sora told VOA in a video interview. 'Locking in this legal agreement with Nauru is one part of the effort to maintain Australia’s access and to deny China’s access to that space.' Last week, Australia also struck a deal with Papua New Guinea, or PNG, that will see Canberra provide $384 million over 10 years to help the Pacific Island country set up a rugby team that will start competing in Australia’s national rugby league in 2028. The funding is also expected to help build a compound to accommodate players and offer tax breaks to recruit players. In return, PNG signed a separate pact that reaffirms Australia as the country’s major security partner. While many details of the two agreements remain confidential, analysts and media outlets briefed by Canberra said the deals allow Australia to withdraw funding for the rugby team if PNG signs a security agreement with a country outside the so-called 'Pacific Family,' which excludes China. 'We know from briefings with government officials and media reports that there is a security commitment that PNG has agreed to not to sign a policing or military deal with China,' Sora told VOA. Some PNG analysts say the agreement is part of Australia’s attempt to build closer ties with PNG’s civil society. 'Australia realized that all this aid and budgetary support that it has been giving to PNG hasn’t translated into buying support for them at the grassroots level and since a lot of people in PNG support Australian rugby teams, [Canberra] picks a sport that a good portion of the PNG population is crazy over, with a hope that it could generate more support for Australia at the grassroots level in PNG,' Michael Kabuni, an analyst who previously taught at the University of Papua New Guinea, told VOA in a video interview. During a ceremony announcing the deal in Sydney on December 12, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said the agreement could help his country foster domestic unity and unite PNG and Australia together 'in ways that matter most, people to people.' Analysts say the agreements with Nauru and PNG are part of the more 'assertive' diplomatic push in the Pacific that Australia initiated in 2022 after China signed a secretive security agreement with the Solomon Islands. 'Australia and a lot of its allies, including the United States, were caught off guard with the security deal between the Solomon Islands and China, and by signing the deals with these Pacific Island countries, Canberra demonstrates that it wants to show itself as the partner of choice, and some of the Pacific states are responding,' Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told VOA by phone. While Australia may limit China’s security presence in the Pacific region through these deals, Szadziewski said Pacific island countries can still deepen relations with Beijing in other sectors, including education and trade. 'The ways that Chinese companies can enter the economic sector in the Pacific region are not excluded by these deals and this has been a key way for China to make inroads in the Pacific region in terms of influence,' he added. VOA reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese embassy in Australia for comment but has yet to receive a response. During a meeting with Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa in Beijing last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China 'is willing to make empowering Pacific island countries to tackle climate change a priority in its cooperation with these countries.' Now that Australia has obtained some power to veto security deals in some Pacific countries, Sora said Canberra has to ensure its own priorities don’t overshadow Pacific island countries’ interests and needs. 'Canberra has retained the security manager role [in the Pacific] so the challenge is to demonstrate that Pacific countries’ security needs aren’t subordinate and their own priorities don’t come after Australia’s interests,' he told VOA. Australia’s focus will be 'proving to Pacific countries that their security needs will now be better met as a result of these agreements because anything short of that will leave themselves open to criticism,' Sora added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-deals-with-pacific-nations-aim-to-curb-china-s-influence/7904314.html	2024-12-17T06:56:57-08:00

Ugandan court asks government to pay LRA war crimes' victims	Kampala — A Ugandan International Crimes Division Court has ordered the Ugandan government to pay reparations to war crimes victims affected by atrocities committed by former Lord’s Resistance Army commander Thomas Kwoyelo. The judges argue the order is based on both international and domestic law considering Kwoyelo, 50, has no funds. Kwoyelo was captured in 2009 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and held in detention until a court found him guilty in August of murder, kidnap with intent to murder, pillaging, cruel treatment, torture, rape, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison in October. The LRA, founded in 1986 by Joseph Kony, led a more than 20-year insurgency against the Ugandan government and is accused of carrying out multiple massacres. Kony remains at large. Justice Duncan Gaswaga said the court declaration is not based on fault or vicarious liability but on principles of collective responsibility. 'Atrocities committed on a scale warranting transitional justice is considered a manifestation of a failure on the part of the government that triggers a responsibility for the state to pay reparations to the victims,' said Gaswaga. Transitional justice is a set of policies or mechanisms to address the aftermath of large-scale human rights abuses and sometimes political instability. The office of the Ugandan Attorney General, the government's representative, reiterated its argument that the government is not liable to compensate for crimes committed by private actors and that reparations sought are matters of policy. Speaking to VOA by phone, Silas Aogon, a lawmaker from Northern Uganda, says the draft Transitional Justice Bill has been in the offing since 2019 but has not been brought before Parliament for consideration. He says the bill would address accountability, reparations, institutional reforms, and enable truth telling. Aogon faults the delayed justice on a number of weaknesses. 'There is already institutional weakness, legislative weakness, oversight weakness, given the kind of situation that we have in the country,' he said. 'The kind of polarization that the country went through. The kind of human and other injustices that occurred in society. The social unrest. We needed a strong law, and we needed the Transitional Justice Bill to be passed into law as soon as possible.' The court declarations include $2,700 to be paid to families of each deceased person, $1,000 to those who suffered physical injuries, $950 for each victim household of property loss and $1,350 for victims of gender-based violence such as rape, forced marriage, forced labor and other physical abuse. Lawmaker Betty Ocan says they have been pushing for this bill for a year, and fears they are running out of time since the current Parliament ends in 2026 and passing the Transitional Justice Bill doesn’t seem to be a priority. 'We need the bill to be worked on to come to an Act of Parliament. In order for our victims also to have, you know, fair compensation,' she said. 'You know, this Parliament is also a difficult one. Instead of prioritizing things which are really for the people, sometimes we prioritize things which are for the president [Yoweri Museveni]. So, we will continue to push.' The court’s judges noted their inability to enforce orders in this matter, stating that the establishment of a trust fund for victims, provisions for an annual budget for victims, and a draft implementation plan to serve the victims, all hinge on parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-court-asks-government-to-pay-lra-war-crimes-victims-/7904267.html	2024-12-17T06:43:06-08:00

Lawyer accused of being Chinese spy loses legal case against UK intel agency	London — A lawyer accused of trying to interfere in British politics on behalf of the Chinese government has lost a legal challenge against the U.K.'s domestic intelligence agency MI5. Britain's Security Service issued a security alert to all lawmakers in January 2022, warning that London-based lawyer Christine Lee was knowingly engaged in 'political interference activities in the U.K.' in coordination with the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, an organization known to exert Chinese influence abroad. The House of Commons' Speaker warned at the time that Lee had 'facilitated' covert donations to British political parties and legislators 'on behalf of foreign nationals.' Members of Parliament are required to declare the source of donations they receive, which must be from U.K.-registered electors or entities. Lee's firm, Christine Lee & Co., provided legal services mainly to the British Chinese community and had acted as a legal advisor to the Chinese embassy in London. Her son, Daniel Wilkes, worked for lawmaker Barry Gardiner as a diary manager for five years, while she had donated some 500,000 pounds ($635,000) to Gardiner, mostly for office costs, according to official records. Lee, who was not accused of a criminal offense, brought a legal action, arguing that the security alert against her was political and that it breached her human rights. On Tuesday, three judges at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal unanimously dismissed her claim, saying MI5 had issued the warning for 'legitimate reasons.' The tribunal decision came the day after British authorities named Chinese national Yang Tengbo as an alleged spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew and sought to exert influence among British establishment figures on behalf of China's United Front Work Department. Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, was banned from entering the U.K. last year after MI5 found that he was believed to have carried out 'covert and deceptive activity' for China. Authorities said his relationship with the royal had a covert nature, citing correspondence that referenced getting people 'unnoticed in and out of the house of Windsor.' Yang strongly denied the claims. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Tuesday called the spying allegations against Yang 'ridiculous,' while the Chinese Embassy in Britain condemned U.K. lawmakers for 'smearing' China. 'We urge the UK side to immediately stop creating trouble, stop anti-China political manipulations, and stop undermining normal personnel exchanges between China and the UK,' a statement released on the embassy's website said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawyer-accused-of-being-chinese-spy-loses-legal-case-against-uk-intel-agency/7904203.html	2024-12-17T05:40:37-08:00	
Japan targets 40-50% power supply from renewable energy by 2040	Tokyo — Japan wants renewable energy to account for up to 50% of its electricity mix by fiscal year 2040 with nuclear power taking up another 20%, according to a draft of its revised basic energy policy, as it makes a clean energy push while meeting rising power demand. As the world's second-largest importer of liquefied natural gas and a major consumer of Middle Eastern oil, Japan and its basic energy plans are drawing global attention from oil, gas and coal producers. Thermal power usage, particularly from inefficient coal-fired power plants, is set to decrease to between 30% and 40% by 2040 from 68.6% in 2023, although the draft energy policy does not specify the breakdown of coal, gas and oil. 'It is necessary to utilize LNG-fired power as a realistic means of transition, and the government and the private sector must jointly secure the necessary long-term LNG contracts in preparation for risks such as price hikes and supply disruptions,' the draft said. The industry ministry's policy draft unveiled on Tuesday proposes increasing renewables to between 40% and 50% of power supplies in the 2040 fiscal year, roughly doubling the 22.9% share in the 2023 fiscal year and exceeding the 2030 target of between 36% and 38%. Japan's 2040 nuclear power target is in line with the 2030 target of between 20% and 22%, despite the challenges faced by the industry after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Nuclear power accounted for 8.5% of the country's power supply in 2023. The new energy plan removes the previous target of 'reducing reliance on nuclear power as much as possible' and includes plans to build innovative next-generation reactors at nuclear power sites owned by operators who have decided to decommission existing reactors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-targets-40-50-power-supply-from-renewable-energy-by-2040-/7904135.html	2024-12-17T05:35:43-08:00	
Japan, India startups to study laser-equipped satellite to tackle space debris	Tokyo — Space startups in Japan and India said on Tuesday they had agreed to jointly study using laser-equipped satellites to remove debris from orbit, an experimental approach to the increasingly imminent problem of orbital congestion. Tokyo-based Orbital Lasers and Indian robotics company InspeCity said they would study business opportunities for in-space services such as de-orbiting a defunct satellite and extending a spacecraft's life. Carved out from Japanese satellite giant SKY Perfect this year, Orbital Lasers is building a system that will use laser energy to stop the rotation of space junk by vaporizing small parts of its surface, making it easier for a servicing spacecraft to rendezvous. Orbital Lasers plans to demonstrate the system in space and supply it to operators after 2027, said Aditya Baraskar, the company's global business lead. It can be mounted on InspeCity satellites if the companies clear regulatory requirements in India and Japan, Baraskar added. The companies said they had signed a preliminary agreement to initiate the collaboration. InspeCity was founded in 2022 and raised $1.5 million last year, while Orbital Lasers has raised $5.8 million since it was established in January. A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October said that urgent action was necessary to track and manage objects in low Earth orbit because of the rapid increase in satellites and space junk. There are already more than 100 companies in the space servicing market as satellite constellations expand, Nobu Okada, chief executive of Japanese debris mitigation pioneer Astroscale, said earlier this year. The project is the latest example of collaboration between Japan and India, whose governments are working together on the joint Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) mission, which could launch as early as 2026. Indian rocket maker Skyroot and satellite builder HEX20 are also working with Japanese moon exploration firm ispace on a future lunar orbiter mission. The two countries' commercial space tie-ups have been driven by Japanese satellite data solutions for India's disaster management and agriculture, and can expand to more fields such as manufacturing, said Masayasu Ishida, chief executive of Tokyo-based nonprofit SPACETIDE, which has hosted space business conferences since 2015. 'The key is finding where and how to build complementary relationships' that align with national policies such as Make in India, which aims to boost local production, Ishida said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-india-startups-to-study-laser-equipped-satellite-to-tackle-space-debris-/7904129.html	2024-12-17T04:58:09-08:00	
Russia sells out of vast Kazakh uranium deposits to China	Moscow — Kazakhstan's state-controlled nuclear resources company said on Tuesday that Russia's state Rosatom corporation was selling its stakes in vast uranium deposits that it had been developing with the world's largest uranium producer. Kazatomprom said that Rosatom unit, Uranium One Group, had sold its 49.979% stake in the Zarechnoye mine to SNURDC Astana Mining Company Limited, whose ultimate beneficiary is China's State Nuclear Uranium Resources Development Company. Uranium One Group is also expected to give up 30% in the Khorasan-U joint venture to China Uranium Development Company Limited, the ultimate beneficiary of which is China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN, China), Kazatomprom said. Kazatomprom's stakes will remain unchanged, it said. Zarechnoye's uranium reserves amounted to approximately 3,500 tons at the beginning of 2024, according to Kazatomprom. Khorasan-U operates at the Kharasan-1 block of Severny Kharasan deposit in the Zhanakorgan district of the Kyzylorda region. Uranium reserves of the deposit amounted to about 33,000 tons at the beginning of 2024, with an expected maturity in 2038, Kazatomprom said. Rosatom did not immediately comment. Uranium One produced 4,831 tons of uranium in Kazakhstan in 2023. Kazatomprom is the world's largest producer of uranium and has the largest reserve base. It accounted for approximately 20% of global primary uranium production in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sells-out-of-vast-kazakh-uranium-deposits-to-china-/7904119.html	2024-12-17T04:51:11-08:00	
France to impose nighttime curfew on 'devastated' Mayotte	Saint-Denis de la Reunion, France — France said it will impose a nighttime curfew on the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte starting on Tuesday evening, after the French overseas territory was devastated by a cyclone feared to have killed hundreds. According to the latest official toll, 21 people are confirmed to have been killed by Cyclone Chido when it barreled into the island and its surrounding archipelago at the weekend. But authorities fear that hundreds, and possibly even thousands, were killed, once the true scale of the toll is revealed, after the rubble is cleared and roads unblocked. The health services are in tatters, power and mobile phone services have been knocked out, the airport closed to civilian flights, and there is mounting concern about how to ensure supplies of drinking water. Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fueled by climate change, according to experts. The curfew from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am local time (1900 GMT to 0100 GMT) is being put in place as a security measure to prevent looting, the French interior ministry said. 'Completely devastated' French President Emmanuel Macron, who chaired a crisis meeting on Monday night, has described the situation as a 'tragedy' and promised to visit Mayotte in the coming days. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who on Monday was the first top Paris official to visit the island after the cyclone, said that Mayotte has been 'completely devastated,' with 70 percent of inhabitants affected. 'The toll will be heavy; too heavy,' Retailleau warned. He announced the arrival 'in the coming days' of 400 additional gendarmes to reinforce the 1,600 gendarmes and police officers present on the archipelago, while specifying that there had 'not really been any looting' so far. The 'exceptional' cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told AFP. Mayotte is France's poorest region, with an estimated one third of the population living in shantytowns whose flimsy sheet metal-roofed homes offered scant protection against the storm. 'We're starting to run out of water. In the south, there's been no running water for five days,' said Antoy Abdallah, a resident of Tsoundzou in the territory's capital Mamoudzou. 'We're completely cut off from the world,' the 34-year-old lamented. Most of Mayotte's population is Muslim and religious tradition dictates bodies must be buried rapidly, meaning some may never be counted. And assessing the toll is further complicated by irregular immigration to Mayotte, especially from the Comoros islands to the north, meaning much of the population is not even registered. Mayotte officially has 320,000 inhabitants but authorities estimate there could be 100,000 to 200,000 more people, taking into account illegal immigration. Ousseni Balahachi, a former nurse, said some people did not dare venture out to seek assistance, 'fearing it would be a trap' designed to remove them from Mayotte. Many had stayed put 'until the last minute' when it proved too late to escape the cyclone, she added. 'Not seen for decades' Mayotte is one of several French overseas territories that span the globe from the Caribbean to the Pacific via the Indian Ocean, and are integral parts of France which are ruled from Paris. French military planes have been shuttling between Mayotte and the island of La Reunion, also a French overseas territory, to the east which was spared the cyclone and is serving as the hub for rescue efforts. The first air evacuation of 25 badly wounded from Mayotte to La Reunion took place on Monday night, Health Minister Genevieve Darrieussecq said. The disaster poses a major challenge for a national government still operating in merely a caretaker capacity, days after Macron appointed the sixth prime minister of his presidency. New Prime Minister Francois Bayrou was facing a torrent of criticism less than a week into the job after choosing to chair a provincial town hall meeting in his capacity as mayor of the city Pau instead of attending in person a crisis meeting on Mayotte called by Macron. 'In the face of such a catastrophe — of a kind that has not been seen on French territory for decades — it is important to be side-by-side with the people,' said French National Assembly speaker Yael Braun-Pivet, a member of Macron's centrist party. 'I would have preferred that the prime minister, instead of taking a plane for Pau, took a plane for Mamoudzou,' she told Franceinfo radio.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-to-impose-nighttime-curfew-on-devastated-mayotte-/7904113.html	2024-12-17T04:41:48-08:00	
Taipei mayor calls for reduced tensions during rare visit of Chinese officials	TAIPEI — The mayor of Taiwan's capital told visiting Chinese officials on Tuesday he hoped for peace and wanted less of the 'howls of ships and aircraft' around the island, saying dialog trumps confrontation. China, which views democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends warplanes and warships near the island on an almost daily basis, and held a new round of mass military activities last week. Addressing the annual Taipei Shanghai City Forum with Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan in attendance, Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an used poetic language to say he wished for peace across the Taiwan Strait. 'More dialog and less confrontation; more olive branches of peace and less sour grapes of conflict. More lights from fishing boats to adorn the sunset; less of the howls of ships and aircraft,' Chiang said. 'I always say that the more tense and difficult the moment, the more we need to communicate,' he added. China has continued to send warplanes and warships into the strait even with the forum taking place, with Taiwan's defense ministry saying on Tuesday morning that in the past 24 hours it had detected 10 military aircraft and seven warships. Chiang is from Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which traditionally favors close ties across the Taiwan Strait although it denies being pro-Beijing. He is widely considered a future presidential contender. The forum, first held in 2010, is one of the few high-level venues for talks between Chinese and Taiwanese officials after China cut off a regular dialog mechanism with Taiwan's central government in 2016 following the election of Tsai Ing-wen as president. Tsai, and her successor Lai Ching-te, refuse to acknowledge Beijing's position that both China and Taiwan are part of 'one China.' Lai, like Tsai, says only Taiwan's people can decide their future, rejecting Beijing's sovereignty claims. Hua told the forum he hoped for closer practical cooperation. 'Compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have always been one family. We often come and go, getting closer and closer to each other,' he said. Shanghai tour group trips to Taiwan will restart, Hua added, offering his own olive branch given China has yet to allow a full post-pandemic resumption of tourism to the island. Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said on Monday the government was showing goodwill by allowing the forum to take place even in the face of the 'still serious situation across the Taiwan Strait.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-mayor-calls-for-reduced-tensions-during-rare-visit-of-chinese-officials-/7904110.html	2024-12-17T04:32:26-08:00	
Political strife erupts over South Korean court as it is set to determine fate of impeached Yoon	SEOUL — South Korea’s acting leader vowed Tuesday to convey to the world that things are back to normal following parliament’s impeachment of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, but rival parties began squabbling over the mechanics of a court ruling to determine whether to formally unseat or reinstate him. The country’s liberal opposition-controlled parliament voted to impeach Yoon last Saturday over his short-lived Dec. 3 martial law imposition, suspending his presidential powers until the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold or overturn the decision. If Yoon is dismissed, a national election must be held to pick his successor within two months. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting leader, has taken steps to reassure the U.S. and other countries and stabilize markets. Presiding over a Cabinet Council meeting on Tuesday, Han said he will 'continuously do my utmost to inform the international society that Republic of Korea is fast regaining stability and maintain confidence with partners.' But the country’s intense political strife appears to be far from over, as the rival parties began bickering over whether to fill three vacant justices’ seats at the Constitutional Court. To formally end Yoon’s presidency, the nine-member court panel needs support from at least six justices. But since three seats remain vacant following retirements, a unanimous decision in favor of Yoon's impeachment is required to throw him out of office for good. Three of the court’s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three others are nominated by the Supreme Court head and another three by the National Assembly, and their formal appointments by the president has widely been a formality. The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by the National Assembly — two by the Democratic Party and the other by Yoon’s ruling People Power Party. The court can rule on Yoon’s case only with the current six justices. But the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which led the impeachment efforts against Yoon, has said it would speed up the process of restoring the court’s nine-justice system to promote fairness and public confidence in its ruling. But PPP floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, created a stir Tuesday as he voiced his objection to a Democratic Party push to fill the three vacancies. He said it would be inappropriate for Han, the acting leader, to appoint justices nominated by parliament, saying such authorities solely rest with the president. 'An acting president can appoint Constitutional Court justices when there is a presidential vacancy, but not when the president’s duties are just suspended,' Kweon said. Many observers say the court’s current six-member configuration is advantageous for Yoon’s chances to return to office, as it would only require a single justice rejecting the parliament impeachment. They note Cheong Hyungsik, one of the six justices, is a clear conservative who was directly appointed by Yoon. The Democratic Party quickly dismissed Kweon’s argument as 'absurd and utterly nonsensical' and urged PPP to abide by a November agreement between the rival parties to nominate the three Constitutional Court justices. Party lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae said PPP has 'blatantly revealed their true intention to obstruct the constitutional trial.' There was no immediate response from Han, who during the Cabinet meeting stressed that the government will cooperate with the ruling and opposition parties to stabilize the economy. There is no clear definition about what an acting president can and cannot do over the appointments of court justices. The Democratic party accuses PPP of trying to drag out the impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which has up to 180 days to determine Yoon's fate. Time is a crucial issue for Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who is favored by polls to win a presidential by-election in the event of Yoon’s ouster but grapples with his own legal troubles. Lee could possibly be prohibited from running for president if the appellate and Supreme courts uphold his lower court conviction for election law violation in November. Yoon faces allegations of rebellion and abuse of power over his martial law introduction. Investigative authorities want him to appear for questioning later this week, but officials at Yoon's office and residence on Monday refused to receive requests for his appearance. The martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, drew hundreds of troops who tried to encircle parliament and prevent lawmakers from voting on the decree. Many lawmakers still managed to get inside a National Assembly chamber and voted to overturn Yoon's decree unanimously, forcing Yoon's Cabinet to lift it. Yoon's decree, which harkened back to an era of past military-backed dictatorships, has sparked massive street protests calling for his ouster and resulted in his approval rating plummeting. Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have been arrested over their roles in the martial law enforcement. Supporters of Yoon worry that his early exit would severely hamper the country's conservatives and cause them to likely lose a presidential by-election to the liberals, like they did in 2017, when then-impeached conservative President Park Geun-hye was ousted and arrested over a corruption scandal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/political-strife-erupts-over-south-korean-court-as-it-is-set-to-determine-fate-of-impeached-yoon-/7904108.html	2024-12-17T04:25:12-08:00	
Israel’s defense minister envisions Israeli post-war security control in Gaza	Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday that Israel would have security control over Gaza after its war against the Hamas militant group. 'After eliminating Hamas's military and governmental capabilities in Gaza, Israel would have security control over Gaza with complete freedom of action' Katz posted on X. He compared the vision for Gaza to the situation in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces routinely conduct raids they say are aimed at disrupting terrorist activity. Israel has said its war aims include ensuring the military defeat of Hamas and ensuring militants cannot attack Israel like Hamas did in its October 2023 assault that killed 1,200 people. Israeli control of Gaza would go against the stated post-war vision of the United States, the United Nations and others. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in October that the war in Gaza needs to end 'in a way that keeps Hamas out and makes sure Israel doesn’t stay.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in September that the U.N. envisions the Palestinian Authority, which governs some of the West Bank, would assume authority in Gaza. Gaza health officials said Tuesday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 10 people in Gaza City, while Israel’s military reported the deaths of two of its soldiers during operations in southern Gaza. In addition to those killed in the Hamas attack on Israel, the militants also took about 100 people hostage, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israeli officials in recent days have cited optimism about a potential breakthrough in long-stalled talks to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages still held by the militants. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-defense-minister-envisions-israeli-post-war-security-control-in-gaza-/7904094.html	2024-12-17T04:10:26-08:00	
US hits North Korea and Russia with new sanctions, Treasury says	Washington — The United States hit North Korea and Russia on Monday with new sanctions targeting Pyongyang's financial and military support to Moscow as well as its ballistic missile program. The sanctions, which list North Korean banks, generals and other officials, as well as Russian oil shipping companies, are the latest U.S. measure aimed at disrupting North Korea's support to Russia's war in Ukraine. The North Korean banks targeted include Golden Triangle Bank, one of the biggest banks in the northeastern Rason Special Economic Zone, and Pyongyang-based Korea Mandal Credit Bank, which has representatives throughout China, the Treasury Department said in a statement. South Korea's foreign ministry separately said on Tuesday that it has blacklisted 11 individuals and 15 entities linked to illicit military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. The responses came as 10 countries, including the U.S., South Korea, Australia, Britain, France and Japan, as well as the European Union, issued a joint statement on Tuesday condemning Pyongyang and Moscow's military ties 'in the strongest possible terms.' The statement said North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine was a 'dangerous expansion of the conflict' and a 'flagrant violation' of United Nations' sanctions. It urged the country to withdraw its troops from Russia. Pyongyang and Moscow have ramped up diplomatic and economic ties in recent years, culminating in Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to North Korea in June when the countries' leaders agreed a mutual defense pact. Military cooperation between the two countries has been met by international alarm, with Washington, Kyiv and Seoul condemning North Korea for sending military equipment and more than 10,000 troops to support Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. North Korea's actions, including its most recent test of a long-range ballistic missile and its deepening military support to Russia, undermine the stability of the region and sustain Putin's war in Ukraine, said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. 'The United States remains committed to disrupting the illicit procurement and facilitation networks that enable these destabilizing activities,' he said. The officials sanctioned by both Washington and Seoul include North Korean generals leading tens of thousands of North Korean troops in Russia, including Kim Yong Bok, who has appeared at seven events with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, including special forces exercises. South Korea separately blacklisted the North's special forces unit known as the Storm Corps, also in Russia fighting against Ukraine, and its chief, Ri Pong Chun. Ukraine said on Monday that at least 30 North Korean soldiers had been killed or injured in combat in Russia's Kursk region over the weekend. It said that Moscow began deploying them in the southern region in significant numbers last week to conduct assaults on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine launched a cross-border incursion into Kursk in August. Kyiv estimates there are 11,000 North Koreans in total, adding to a force of tens of thousands of Russians. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Koreans on its side. Oil and gas to the North The Treasury sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of the designated entities, ban their trade with Americans, and block them from transactions with the U.S. financial system. The Treasury blacklisted Russia-based foreign trade companies that it said were shipping oil and gas to North Korea. The companies include Vostok Trading, DV Ink, and Novosibirskoblgaz. Treasury said they began shipping 'thousands of tons of oil and gas' to North Korea beginning in 2022 and continuing through at least April 2024. North Korea has likely received more than 1 million barrels of oil from Russia over an eight-month period this year in breach of U.N. sanctions, according to an analysis of satellite imagery published in November by the British-based Open Source Centre and the BBC. North Korean oil tankers have made more than 40 visits to Russia's Far Eastern port of Vostochny since March, the report on the research group Open Source Centre's website said. The sanctions also targeted Sibregiongaz, AO, the Russia-based parent company and 100% owner of Novosibirskoblgaz. They also hit Okryu Trading Company, or Okryu, a North Korea-based foreign trade company that Treasury said has received thousands of tons of oil shipments from Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-hits-north-korea-and-russia-with-new-sanctions-treasury-says-/7904085.html	2024-12-17T03:55:37-08:00	
South Korean authorities make new attempt to raid presidential office, Yonhap reports	Seoul — South Korean authorities made a new attempt on Tuesday to search the presidential office and obtain evidence as part of a probe into the legality of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived bid to impose martial law, the Yonhap news agency reported. Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office's security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team. This would be the second time authorities have tried to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament. An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data. The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment. The CIO declined to comment. Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials. Yoon has been putting together a legal team to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers. Meanwhile, South Korea's acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year's government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country's slowing economy. Han has been working to reassure South Korea's allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached. The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-authorities-make-new-attempt-to-raid-presidential-office-yonhap-reports-/7904075.html	2024-12-17T03:43:52-08:00	
Iran says awaiting 'necessary conditions' to reopen Syria embassy	Tehran — Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that its embassy in Syria would reopen once the 'necessary conditions' are met, after the diplomatic mission was vandalized following the ouster of Tehran ally Bashar al-Assad. 'The reopening of the embassy in Damascus requires preparations, the most important of which is ensuring the security and safety of the embassy and its staff,' said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei. He added that work to that end will be pursued 'as soon as the necessary conditions are provided,' without offering a specific timeline. The Iranian embassy in Damascus was ransacked after diplomats abandoned it in the wake of the rapid advance of Islamist-led rebels opposed to Assad's rule. On December 8, the rebel forces took Damascus and ousted the longtime ruler. Iran had supported Assad through Syria's civil war, which began in 2011, sending 'military advisers' at his request. But since his fall, Iran has sought to distance itself from the deposed leader, instead stressing the history of friendship between the two countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-awaiting-necessary-conditions-to-reopen-syria-embassy-/7904063.html	2024-12-17T03:33:12-08:00	
Bomb kills senior Russian general in Moscow	Russian officials said a bomb exploded Tuesday on a Moscow street, killing two people, including the commander of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces. The blast happened as Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his deputy were leaving an apartment building in southeastern Moscow, according to Russia’s investigative committee. Authorities said the bomb was hidden in an electric scooter parked near the building’s entrance. Video from the blast site showed a charred façade, crumpled bricks and broken windows. The bombing came a day after Ukrainian prosecutors charged Kirillov in connection with the use of chemical weapons by Russian forces in their nearly three-year-old war in Ukraine. In October, Britain also sanctioned Kirillov for helping deploy what it called 'barbaric' chemical weapons against Ukrainian forces.

UN expresses hope for ‘ambitious’ boost in humanitarian support for Syrians	U.N. officials on Tuesday signaled optimism about access for humanitarian aid to Syria, while European nations further engaged with the rebels who ousted longtime President Bashar al-Assad from power. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Tuesday he had a 'constructive discussion' with rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and that the U.N. has 'basis for ambitious scaling-up of vital humanitarian support.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement he welcomed a commitment from the caretaker government led by Mohammed Bashir, Syria’s interim prime minister, to protect humanitarian workers, grant humanitarian access through all border crossings and to speed permits and visas for humanitarian workers. 'As the Syrian people seize the opportunity to build a better future, the international community must rally behind them,' Guterres said. French special envoy for Syria Jean-Francois Guillaume said during a visit to Syria on Tuesday that France 'is preparing to be with Syrians' during their transitional period. Guillaume was among the latest envoys to go to Syria for talks with those leading the transition. Germany’s foreign ministry said Tuesday its diplomats would hold their first talks with rebel leaders in Damascus. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc was already stepping up its humanitarian assistance to Syria, and that it must see how it can support Syria’s 'democratic aspirations.' 'Assad had proven time and again that there would be never a peaceful, united and stable Syria, nor regional stability, under his rule,' Kallas said. She cited a 'historic moment of opportunity,' saying this is a 'critical moment for Syria and for the international community.'
