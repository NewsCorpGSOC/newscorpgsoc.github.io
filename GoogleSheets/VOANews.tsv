Trump's plan for US to take over Gaza meets mixed reactions	U.S. President Donald Trump’s idea for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip has shocked Israelis and Palestinians. While some Israelis welcome the idea, Palestinians categorically reject it.

Trump's birthright citizenship order gets put on hold by 2nd federal judge	GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday ordered a second temporary pause on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. 'This court will not be the first,' she said. Trump's inauguration week order had already been on temporary hold nationally because of a separate lawsuit brought by four states in Washington state, where a judge called the order 'blatantly unconstitutional.' In total, 22 states, as well as other organizations, have sued to try to stop the executive action. Boardman, nominated by former President Joe Biden, agreed to the preliminary injunction after a hearing in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland. Bringing the suit before Boardman are immigrant-rights advocacy groups CASA and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and a handful of expectant mothers. At the heart of the lawsuits is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that determined Scott, a slave, wasn't a citizen. 'The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens,' the plaintiffs argued in the suit. The Trump administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. 'The Constitution does not harbor a windfall clause granting American citizenship to, inter alia: the children of those who have circumvented (or outright defied) federal immigration laws,' the government argued in reply to the Maryland plaintiffs' suit. The 14th Amendment was added in the aftermath of the Civil War to ensure citizenship for former slaves and free African Americans. It states: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' In addition to the 22 states with Democratic attorneys general seeking to stop the order, 18 Republican attorneys general announced this week that they're seeking to defend the president's order by joining one of the federal suits brought in New Hampshire. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas, and Canada and Mexico are among them. During his first week in office, Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration and issued edicts to carry out promises of mass deportations and border security. Some actions were felt immediately. Others face legal challenges. If they happen at all, other orders may take years to happen but have led to fear in immigrant communities. Whether Trump can enact his agenda could come down to money. Congress is expected to consider funding support soon. Trump may use emergency powers to tap the Defense Department, as he did for a border wall during his first term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order-gets-put-on-hold-by-2nd-federal-judge/7964060.html	2025-02-05T10:18:33-08:00	
Countries’ leaders denounce Trump proposal for US ownership of Gaza	U.S. allies and adversaries alike on Wednesday denounced President Donald Trump’s proposal for the United States to take ownership of the Gaza Strip, force 2 million Palestinians to move to other countries and then turn the territory along the Mediterranean Sea into 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' The world reaction to Trump’s suggestion, offered at a White House news conference Tuesday evening alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was swift and mostly universal in opposition to the idea advanced by the one-time New York real estate magnate. Britain, China, Germany, Ireland, Russia and Spain said they continue to support a two-state solution — creation of an independent Palestinian state that would include Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank existing next to Israel. The two-state proposal, aimed at ending decades of Middle East conflict and wars, has long been the bedrock of U.S. policy in the region even though Netanyahu’s government opposes it. Saudi Arabia, an important oil-producing American ally in the Middle East, weighed in quickly in a sharply worded statement, saying its call for an independent Palestinian state was a 'firm, steadfast and unwavering position.' 'Australia's position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, as it was 10 years ago,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in support of a two-state solution. Netanyahu offered support for the plan, saying Tuesday that one of his war goals is to ensure that Palestinian militant group Hamas never again poses a threat to Israel. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is 'taking it to a much higher level.' 'I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,' he said. Trump was noncommittal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza 'doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,' he said. Palestinians, nearby countries reject Trump ideas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the United Nations to 'protect the Palestinian people and their inalienable rights,' saying that what Trump wanted to do would be 'a serious violation of international law.' Hamas said Trump's Gaza proposal was a 'recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region. Instead of holding the Zionist occupation accountable for the crime of genocide and displacement, it is being rewarded, not punished.' Even before Trump called for U.S. ownership of Gaza, Egypt and Jordan had in recent days rejected his suggestion that Gaza’s Palestinian population be relocated to their countries. Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued a statement stressing the need for rebuilding in Gaza 'without moving the Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.' United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Wednesday that deporting people from Israeli-occupied Gaza was illegal. 'The right to self-determination is a fundamental principle of international law and must be protected by all states, as the International Court of Justice recently underlined afresh,' Turk said in a statement. 'Any forcible transfer in or deportation of people from occupied territory is strictly prohibited.' Trump sees ‘unlimited jobs’ with Gaza development But Trump said at his news conference that Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi would come around to his idea, contending they will 'open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done and people can live in harmony and in peace.' Trump’s Gaza proposal was his first major Middle East policy statement since taking office for a second four-year term two weeks ago. Trump said he envisioned building a resort on the shores of the Mediterranean where international communities could live in harmony. Much of the coastal territory currently lies in ruins, after more than 15 months of Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 47,000 people, more than half women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed 17,000 Hamas militants. Trump’s Gaza proposal comes amid a six-week ceasefire to halt the fighting that erupted Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 250 as hostages. About 60 living captives are still believed to be held by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. During the truce so far, Hamas has released 18 hostages, while Israel in exchange has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. At his news conference, Trump said, 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs. 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,' he said. Trump offered no details on how he plans to exert control over Gaza, which has been decimated by the war, but he did not rule out sending in U.S. troops. 'If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,' he said. Trump’s Gaza ownership idea was a pronounced shift from his past criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. Trump said he envisions a 'long-term ownership position' for the U.S. that would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.' 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he said. The U.S. leader’s Gaza overture was his latest suggestion of an American show of force in far-flung reaches of the world. He has voiced the need for the U.S. to retake control of the Panama Canal from the Panamanian government; buy Greenland, for centuries a Danish territory, and for Canada to be annexed to become the 51st U.S. state. Panama, Denmark and Canada have all rejected his demands. Reactions in the United States Several U.S. lawmakers joined the chorus of world leaders opposing Trump’s Gaza offering. Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware called the comments 'offensive and insane and dangerous and foolish.' The idea, Coons said, 'risks the rest of the world thinking that we are an unbalanced and unreliable partner because our president makes insane proposals.' Coons noted the irony of the proposal coming shortly after Trump had moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, the prime conduit for U.S. foreign aid. Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress from Michigan, accused Trump in a social media post of 'openly calling for ethnic cleansing' with the idea of resettling Gaza's entire population. But a Trump supporter, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, adopted a light-hearted assessment, saying, 'Let’s turn Gaza into Mar-A-Lago,' referring to Trump’s Atlantic oceanside resort residence and club in south Florida that he calls the Winter White House. House Speaker Mike Johnson, the leader of the narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives, offered support for Trump’s Gaza takeover, saying, 'Yeah, we're trying to get the details of it, but I think this is a good development.' Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune, in a neutral view, said Trump 'wants a more peaceful and secure Middle East and put some ideas out there.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/countries-leaders-denounce-trump-proposal-for-us-ownership-of-gaza/7963989.html	2025-02-05T09:38:48-08:00	
Earthquakes keep rattling Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes	ATHENS, GREECE — Earthquakes rattled Greece's volcanic island of Santorini every few minutes through the night and into Wednesday as authorities bolstered their emergency plans in case the hundreds of temblors over the past few days are a harbinger of a larger quake to come. A coast guard vessel and a military landing craft were in the wider area as a contingency should an evacuation be required, Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said Wednesday during an emergency meeting with security officials, scientists and the prime minister in Athens. 'We are obliged to draw up scenarios for better and for worse regarding the prolonged seismic activity,' Kikilias said during the meeting, which was televised live. Predicting earthquakes is not scientifically possible, and experts cannot yet determine definitively whether the seismic activity between the islands of Santorini and Amorgos could be a precursor to a significantly larger earthquake, or is part of an earthquake swarm that could continue shaking the area with small or moderate intensity quakes for weeks or months. 'I understand the fear of what it means at the moment to be on a Santorini that is constantly moving,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, as he called on residents to remain calm and follow authorities' instructions. Rescue crews with a sniffer dog and drones have been deployed on Santorini as a precaution since Sunday, while authorities have banned access to several coastal areas and ordered schools on several islands to shut for the week. Public events on Santorini have been banned, and local authorities were restricting access to clifftop areas that are among the biggest tourist draws to the island. Thousands of residents and visitors have already left Santorini, frightened by the hundreds of earthquakes measuring between magnitude 3 and magnitude 5 that have struck the area since the weekend. Ferry lines and commercial airlines have added ships and flights to their schedules this week to accommodate the increased demand. However, ferry services were disrupted on Wednesday due to rough weather. The quakes, which all have epicenters beneath the seabed between Santorini and the Amorgos, have so far caused no injuries or major damage, although limited rockslides and cracks in some older buildings have been reported on Santorini. Greece lies in a highly seismically active part of the world and earthquakes are frequent. But it is extremely rare for any part of the country to experience such an intense barrage of frequent earthquakes. Last week, authorities said monitors had picked up increased volcanic activity within Santorini's caldera, or flooded crater, but scientists say this is unrelated to the current quakes. They have also said the seismic activity northeast of the island is unlikely to trigger either of the two volcanoes in the area. Southeast Aegean regional governor Giorgos Hatzimarkos told Greek state television that the country's electricity provider had sent staff and equipment to the island to prepare contingency plans in case of power cuts, while civil engineers were checking the road network. Digital Governance Deputy Minister Konstantinos Kyranakis said the government was working with telecommunications providers to ensure backup plans in case of a network outage in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-keep-rattling-greece-s-volcanic-island-of-santorini-every-few-minutes/7963901.html	2025-02-05T08:12:18-08:00	
Argentina says it will withdraw from WHO, echoing Trump	BUENOS AIRES — President Javier Milei has ordered Argentina's withdrawal from the World Health Organization due to profound differences with the U.N. agency, a presidential spokesperson said Wednesday. Milei's action echoes that of his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, who began the process of pulling the United States out of the WHO with an executive order on his first day back in office on Jan. 21. Argentina's decision is based on 'profound differences in health management, especially during the [COVID19] pandemic,' spokesperson Manuel Adorni said at a news conference in Buenos Aires. He said that WHO guidelines at the time had led to the largest shutdown 'in the history of mankind.' He also said that the WHO lacked independence because of the political influence of some countries, without elaborating which countries. Argentina will not allow an international organization to intervene in its sovereignty 'and much less in our health,' Adorni said. The WHO is the United Nations’ specialized health agency and is the only organization mandated to coordinate global responses to acute health crises, particularly outbreaks of new diseases and persistent threats such as Ebola, AIDS and mpox.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-says-it-will-withdraw-from-who-echoing-trump/7963895.html	2025-02-05T08:11:09-08:00

Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson: A populist legacy revisited	One of U.S. President Donald Trump’s first moves upon returning to the Oval Office was restoring a portrait of Andrew Jackson, a president he often cites as a source of inspiration. But this act of decor is more than symbolic — it underscores striking parallels between Trump and Jackson in their governing styles, populist messaging and shared defiance of political elites. Here's how the two presidents compare and why the connection matters.

US deportation flight carrying illegal Indian migrants lands in Punjab	New Delhi — A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner. New Delhi, which does not want to make illegal immigration a contentious issue with Washington, has said that it is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States if their nationality is verified. President Donald Trump said last week that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would 'do what's right' in taking back illegal immigrants. His comment came following a phone conversation with Modi. In New Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a media briefing on Friday that India and the United States are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration and 'cooperation between India and the U.S. is strong and effective in this domain. This will be evident in times to come.' Trade and migration are expected to be key issues during a meeting that could take place next week between Trump and Modi. 'India does not want to focus on the issue of illegal migrants being deported. We know it is big business in India, sending migrants illegally. Instead, the government’s interest is in ensuring that legal migration channels to the U.S. for Indian nationals are not restricted by the Trump administration,' according to Manoj Joshi, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Those legal routes are H-1B visas for skilled workers and visas for students. 'Both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration, while also creating more avenues for legal migration from India to the U.S.,' Jaiswal has said. The number of Indian migrants attempting to enter the U.S. unlawfully has grown in recent years, with India now accounting for the largest number of illegal immigrants to the United States from Asian countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Their overall numbers, however, are still small; Indians account for only about 3 percent of illegal crossings. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, according to a Bloomberg report last week. Deportation flights to India are not new — between October 2023 and September 2024, more than 1,000 Indian nationals were repatriated, but Wednesday's flight was the first time that they were sent back via military aircraft. The deportation flight was routed to Amritsar city in Punjab, which is among the three states where much of the illegal migration from India to the U.S. originates. The others are Haryana in the north and the western state of Gujarat. Hours before the flight landed, Punjab’s minister for NRI (Non-Resident Indians) Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, urged people in the state to avoid illegal migration and instead focus on acquiring skills and education to access global opportunities through legal channels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportation-flight-carrying-illegal-indian-migrants-lands-in-punjab-/7963746.html	2025-02-05T06:09:08-08:00

US Postal Service suspends inbound parcels from China, Hong Kong	HONG KONG/SEOUL/SHANGHAI — The U.S. Postal Service said it would temporarily suspend parcels from China and Hong Kong, after President Donald Trump ended a trade provision this week used by retailers including Temu and Shein to ship low-value packages duty-free to the U.S. The Trump administration imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods that came into effect on Tuesday and moved to close the 'de minimis' exemption that allows U.S. shoppers to avoid paying tariffs for shipments below $800. The extra tariff and the elimination of de minimis follow repeated warnings by Trump that Beijing was not doing enough to halt the flow of fentanyl, a dangerous synthetic opioid, into the U.S. Reuters reported previously that Chinese suppliers use the duty-free provision to export chemical materials for fentanyl by disguising them as gadgets and other low-cost goods. 'This is huge... People waiting for orders from Amazon, Shein and Temu have no way of knowing when they can receive those orders,' said Ram Ben Tzion, founder of Ultra Information Solution, the firm behind digital shipment vetting platform Publican. USPS said the change will not impact the flow of letters and 'flats' — mail that can be up to 15 inches (38 cm) long or 3/4 inches (1.9 cm) thick — from China and Hong Kong. It did not immediately comment on whether this was tied to Trump's change to ending de minimis shipments from China and other countries. 'The USPS would require some time to sort out how to execute the new taxes before allowing Chinese packages to arrive in the U.S. again,' said Chelsey Tam, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. 'This is a significant challenge for them because there were 4 million de minimis packages per day in 2024, and it is difficult to check all the packages — so it will take time.' At a Hong Kong post office, a businessman who had come to check the status of a package he sent to the U.S. earlier expressed frustration after a staffer told him it wasn't possible to ascertain where his delivery might be now. 'This political war is affecting the local people, not just in Hong Kong but in other places too. It's very disturbing for us,' John Khan, who has run a trading business for nearly 30 years, told Reuters. China's foreign ministry called on Wednesday for dialog and consultation between Beijing and Washington, adding that reducing demand for drugs at home and enhancing law enforcement cooperation was the fundamental way for the U.S. to solve its fentanyl crisis. Greater scrutiny Logistics provider Easyship warned clients who regularly send sub-$800 shipments to the U.S. were likely to face much greater scrutiny and advised them to set up distribution centers within the U.S., partner with a local warehouse or U.S. fulfillment center. Some other international couriers including FedEx FDX.N and SF Express, China's largest express delivery company, said they continue to send packages to the U.S. FedEx, however, added it had suspended its money-back guarantee for U.S. inbound shipments effective Jan. 29, citing recent regulatory changes, according to a notice on its website. Fast-fashion retailer Shein and online dollar-store Temu, both of which sell products ranging from toys to smartphones, have grown rapidly in the U.S. thanks in part to the de minimis exemption. The two firms together likely accounted for more than 30% of all packages shipped to the United States each day under the de minimis provision, the U.S. congressional committee on China said in a June 2023 report. Nearly half of all packages shipped under de minimis come from China, according to the report. Shein and Temu did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 'Doing the paperwork for customs declarations was not something these companies had to deal with very often before,' said Basile Ricard, operations director at Ceva Logistics Greater China. 'So this is a very new process for them. If this remains a largely manual process it will be incredibly difficult... It's really not clear for us at this stage how they are going to manage that.' Amazon also has a large seller base in China, with e-commerce consultancy Marketplace Pulse estimating in February that China-based sellers represent nearly half of the top 10,000 sellers on Amazon in the U.S. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In November, the U.S. company set up Amazon Haul to allow shoppers to purchase $5 handbags and $10 sweaters from China-based sellers. Delays in deliveries Trump's crackdown on de minimis would make the products sold by the likes of Shein and Temu more expensive but is unlikely to dramatically impact shipment volumes, experts said. 'E-commerce volumes out of China grew 20-30% last year, so it's going to take a sledgehammer to crack that level of consumer demand and I'm not sure de minimis alone is enough,' said Niall van de Wouw, Chief Airfreight Officer at freight platform Xeneta. 'They will still be cheaper than buying through retailers in the U.S. Delays in receiving the goods due to operational disruptions could have a bigger impact than price.' Shein has previously said it supports reform of the de minimis provision. Both Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, and Singapore-headquartered Shein, which plans to list in London this year, have taken measures such as sourcing more products from outside China, opening U.S. warehouses and bringing more U.S. sellers on board, to mitigate the impact. In what would be another blow to the two China-founded e-commerce platforms, the U.S. is discussing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security's 'forced labor' list, Semafor reported on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-postal-service-suspends-inbound-parcels-from-china-hong-kong-/7963688.html	2025-02-05T05:12:38-08:00

South Africa's unity government steady after stormy start	Johannesburg — In the seven months since it was formed, South Africa's unlikely unity government has been stretched and cracked but remains intact under the leadership of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who delivers its first state of the nation address Thursday. Several loud quarrels have erupted over sticking points such as language education in schools and Ramaphosa's warm words towards Russia but nothing that has made real the threats and fears of collapse. 'They think we are at each other's throats. We are not. We continue to meet and talk,' Ramaphosa said in the wake of the latest crisis sparked by his signing of a property expropriation bill last month. The second-largest partner in the 10-party coalition, the Democratic Alliance, was angry that Ramaphosa signed the act without consulting his partners in the government of national unity (GNU). 'This is not how coalitions work,' DA leader John Steenhuisen fumed. 'We will not be reduced to being spectators.' But the party did not object to the need for land reform in the country, where most farmland is owned by whites. It also sided with Ramaphosa when the bill was attacked by US President Donald Trump for allowing the 'confiscation' of property, saying this was untrue. The DA has six ministries in exchange for propping up Ramaphosa's ANC in government after it failed to win enough votes in the May election to govern alone, a first since the party took power in 1994 and ended decades of white-minority apartheid rule. It was an unlikely collaboration, with the DA a long and critical rival of the African National Congress (ANC). But the GNU, which includes eight other smaller parties, has been credited with bringing some stability to the continent's most industrialized economy as it faces a host of challenges, from an unemployment rate topping 30%, to high rates of crime. Big business While it has fumed and flexed, the center-right DA is also aware that, should it quit the unity government, the ANC could find support from the radical-left EFF and the populist MK parties, now in opposition. It is a scenario it calls a 'doomsday coalition'. 'This is something the DA will move Table Mountain to avoid,' Sunday Times editor-in-chief Makhudu Sefara wrote in a weekend column. 'And therein lies the extent to which they're prepared to compromise.' The DA will not walk out, said political scientist Sandile Swana. 'It is the political party of big business,' he said. 'And the GNU was mandated, or demanded or directed, to come into existence by big business in South Africa.' Despite some cynical maneuvring at local government level -- for example, to push out the DA mayor of the city of Tshwane in September -- the coalition will even survive bitter local elections due in late 2026, said political scientist Susan Booysen told AFP. 'They could actually go into a poisonous, toxic local government election campaign and continue with the national coalition,' she said. 'It's such a schizophrenic type of coalition.' Ramaphosa, meanwhile, is walking a fine line within his own party, where a large faction of the ANC wants him to assert that it 'is not in the DA's pocket,' Booysen said. But even if Ramaphosa does not complete his term as president, with his future as head of the party not guaranteed after ANC leadership elections in 2027, his successor is also unlikely to end the fractious collaboration, Swana said. 'Even if Ramaphosa is removed, I do not think they will kick the DA out of government,' Swana said. 'The GNU, as things stand, will last the five-year period.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-s-unity-government-steady-after-stormy-start/7963593.html	2025-02-05T02:51:01-08:00	
China says it is willing to work with EU on 'global challenges'	BEIJING — China is willing to work with the European Union on boosting cooperation and responding to 'global challenges,' its foreign ministry said on Wednesday, as the bloc faces potential U.S. tariffs on its shipments to the world's largest economy. China attaches great importance to EU ties and hopes the bloc will become a reliable cooperation partner, said Lin Jian, spokesperson at the Chinese ministry. The EU's trade chief said on Tuesday that the bloc wanted to engage swiftly with the United States over President Donald Trump's planned tariffs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen forecast negotiations with Washington would be tough. As transatlantic ties come under strain with Trump's tariff threats, China hawks within the EU such as von der Leyen are showing signs of willingness to rethink the relationship between Beijing and Brussels, a bond that had been tested by trade tensions and China's ties with Russia. Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, von der Leyen said the EU would keep 'de-risking' its relationship with China but added that there was room to 'find solutions' in their mutual interest and 'find agreements' that could even expand trade and investment ties. She did not give details on what those agreements could be. In Davos, Switzerland, last month, von der Leyen also said both sides should find solutions of mutual interest. In October, the EU imposed double-digit tariffs on China-made electric vehicles after an anti-subsidy investigation, in addition to its standard car import duty of 10%. The move drew loud protests from Beijing, which in return, raised market entry barriers for certain EU products such as brandy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-is-willing-to-work-with-eu-on-global-challenges-/7963583.html	2025-02-05T02:40:02-08:00	
Thailand cuts power, fuel and internet supply to parts of Myanmar	Bangkok — Thailand has cut electricity, internet and fuel supplies to five border areas in Myanmar, a senior Thai minister said on Wednesday, as the Southeast Asian nation steps up efforts to choke scam centers that have become a growing security concern. 'They may face challenges of lower power supply, but we are at the point now where no one can blame Thailand for being part of or play a part in supporting illegal acts,' Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters. 'They may turn to other sources of power supply or generate their own electricity.' Scam compounds in Southeast Asia, including those along the Thai-Myanmar border, are suspected to have entrapped hundreds of thousands of people in illegal online operations, generating billions annually, according to a 2023 U.N. report. Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper in a rare article on scam centers last month said basic essentials, including power and internet, are not provided by Myanmar but by other countries, in a veiled reference to Thailand. International pressure to dismantle these centers has grown after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted after arriving in Thailand last month. He was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. For Thailand, the proliferation of these centers has impacted its vital tourism sector and the country has sought to allay safety concerns of visitors from China, a key source market. Thailand's Provincial Electricity Authority said it had cut a total of 20.37 megawatts of supply to five areas along the border starting from 9 a.m. on Wednesday, which would lead to a loss of 600 million baht ($17.84 million) in revenue per year. It said the affected locations in Myanmar include Tachileik, Myawaddy and Phaya Thonsu, which all lie along the border with Thailand. A resident of Phaya Thonsu, opposite Thailand's Kanchanaburi Province, said many locals have faced power cuts since Wednesday morning, while Chinese businesses, including scam centers, continue to operate on generators. 'Since the last two days, we have seen big generators arriving into the town. Today, those generators are running and their businesses including scam centers are still operating,' he told Reuters, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 'The businesses owned by locals have stopped and the town's people are in trouble.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-cuts-power-fuel-and-internet-supply-to-parts-of-myanmar/7963575.html	2025-02-05T02:23:21-08:00	
Philippine House votes to impeach VP Sara Duterte, process moves ahead	Manila, Philippines — Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to impeach Vice President Sara Duterte, who has fallen out spectacularly with the country's leader, paving the way for a Senate trial that could see her removed from office. While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints in December accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the 'brazen misuse' of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination. 'Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved,' House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers. The fate of Duterte, daughter of the former president, now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to remove her from office and disqualify her from future public positions. A trial date has yet to be set. Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race. Whether 16 senators cast their vote for Duterte's impeachment could come down to President Marcos, Dennis Coronacion, chairman of the political science department at the University of Santo Tomas, told AFP. 'If (Marcos) is committed to this one, to the impeachment process ... I think getting the required number of Senate votes is possible,' he said, adding Wednesday's vote had come as something of a surprise. But should the administration stay hands-off, the chances of Duterte being impeached are closer to 50-50, Coronacion said, pointing to the sitting senators' need for votes from Duterte stronghold Mindanao in the coming election. Family feud The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation. But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a 'storm in a teacup' that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities. Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said Monday that the Office of the President would 'not interfere' with the impeachment complaints. A public relations official told AFP the Senate was expecting the articles of impeachment to arrive at its security office late Wednesday. House of Representatives member Percival Cendana, who had backed one of the three impeachment complaints, urged his colleagues to take quick action, speaking Friday at a rally that drew thousands calling for Duterte's impeachment. Every day of inaction 'condones the impunity, the abuse of power and the harassment that Duterte is doing to our country's leaders,' he told reporters. But that rally was dwarfed by one a conservative sect organized that drew hundreds of thousands to the street on Jan. 13 opposing the vice president's impeachment. Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket. But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated. She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing 'consternation' with the administration's failures. The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged Dec. 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests. With her impeachment, Duterte becomes one of only four high-ranking officials to share that fate since the Philippines returned to democracy after the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr came to an end in 1986. Along with a Supreme Court justice and a high-profile prosecutor, then-president Joseph Estrada was impeached in November 2000 on charges of embezzlement and taking kickbacks from illegal gambling operations. When the Senate tribunal refused to accept key evidence, Filipinos took to the streets in a bloodless revolt, leading Estrada to step down when the military withdrew its support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-house-votes-to-impeach-vp-sara-duterte-process-moves-ahead/7963572.html	2025-02-05T02:13:56-08:00	
Swedish police warn of online misinformation after mass school shooting	OREBRO, Sweden — Swedish police said on Wednesday there was no evidence of 'ideological motives' behind a mass shooting at an adult education center on Tuesday, and warned of misinformation spread on social media about the Nordic country's deadliest gun attack. At least 11 people died and many others were wounded in the shooting at the Risbergska school in Orebro, a town of over 100,000 people, where large numbers of police continued to cordon off the center and several schools located on its campus complex. A vigil with candles and flowers had been set up nearby. 'We want to be clear that based on investigative and intelligence information at present, there is no information pointing to the culprit acting on ideological motives,' police said in a brief statement on its website. Police have said the motive for the crime was not immediately known, and that they believed the suspected perpetrator, who was among the dead and was not known previously to the police, acted alone. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday said the attack was the worst mass shooting in Swedish history, calling it a 'painful day,' while King Carl XVI Gustav conveyed his condolences. Flags at official buildings in Orebro, some 200 km west of Stockholm, as well as at the Swedish parliament and the royal palace in the capital, were flying at half-mast as a sign of respect and mourning. 'Our task is to take care of those attending the affected school, those who work there as well as inhabitants of Orebro, who are worried and sad,' Orebro Municipal Director Peter Larsson said in a statement. Many students in Sweden's adult school system are immigrants seeking to improve their basic education and gain degrees to help them find jobs in the Nordic country while also learning Swedish. Police said in a statement it did not see any general threat against schools or pre-schools in the country, nor against adult education schools, including Swedish classes for immigrants. 'We also at present don't see any danger to the public, even if we understand that the incident raises concerns and many questions,' it said. Sweden has been struggling with a wave of shootings and bombings caused by an endemic gang crime problem that has seen the country of 10 million people record by far the highest per capita rate of gun violence in the EU in recent years. However, fatal attacks at schools are rare. Ten people were killed in seven incidents of deadly violence at schools between 2010 and 2022, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-police-warn-of-online-misinformation-after-mass-school-shooting/7963559.html	2025-02-05T01:44:13-08:00	
Islamic State members held for years in a Syria prison say they know nothing of the world	HASSAKEH, Syria — Men of various ages and nationalities sit silently in their cells, a small window in the metal doors their only opening to the world. All are alleged members of the Islamic State group, captured during the final days of the extremists' so-called caliphate declared in large parts of Iraq and Syria. The Gweiran Prison, now called Panorama, has held about 4,500 IS-linked detainees for years. The Associated Press was given an exclusive visit to the prison, nearly two months after the fall of the 54-year Assad dynasty in Syria — an upheaval the detainees might not even know about as prison officials try to limit outside information. Syrian President Bashar Assad's ouster during a lightning insurgent offensive in December has led to new attention, and new pressures, on such detention centers in the country's northeast that have been holding some 9,000 IS members without trial. The centers are guarded by members of the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, that in March 2019 captured the last sliver of land that IS members once held, the eastern town of Baghouz. SDF chief commander Mazloum Abdi told the AP that after the fall of Assad, IS members captured large amounts of weapons in eastern Syria from posts abandoned by forces loyal to the former president. An SDF security official warned that the extremists might attack detention facilities and try to free their comrades. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The detainees are 'a literal and figurative ‘ISIS army’ in detention,' Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of the U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Syria last month. The prison visit occurred in a corridor with six cells on each side and with masked guards holding clubs. A window in a cell door was opened, and the detainees were told they could speak briefly to journalists. A young man moved forward and identified himself as Maher, a nurse from Melbourne, Australia. Prison authorities asked that only first names be used. 'I’d love to go back to Australia,' the man said, adding that he was not arrested in 2019 in Baghouz but gave himself up when the U.S.-led coalition opened a humanitarian corridor. 'I didn’t do anything to anyone. I’ve been here for seven years without judgment. Without anything,' he said, and expressed regret for 'a lot of things.' Maher said he married a Syrian woman and has two sons, and they are at one of the camps housing families of IS members in northeast Syria. He said he has not had information about them, and that he sent a letter to his parents via the International Committee of the Red Cross and never received an answer. The security of the detention centers is a growing question since Assad's fall. One of the most serious threats to the centers came in January 2022 when IS gunmen stormed the prison, leading to 10 days of battles with the SDF that left nearly 500 people dead. The prison, formerly the classrooms of a technical school, was later renovated with the help of the U.S.-led coalition. Security was tight when the AP visited, with armed fighters stationed on roads leading to the facility. But SDF officials have said that recent clashes between their fighters and Turkey-backed gunmen in northern Syria, which coincided with the insurgent offensive that led to Assad's fall, are affecting their ability to protect the prisons. During a visit to Turkey last month by Syria’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan told reporters that Ankara was ready to help Syrian authorities manage the detention centers as well as the camps where more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, with alleged IS links are held. But the SDF chief commander didn't welcome the idea. 'The way Turkey can help is to stop its attacks on us so that we concentrate on the protection of al-Hol and the prisons,' Abdi said. He added that the fate of al-Hol and other prisons can be solved within Syria. The country's future is being discussed in talks between the SDF, which controls nearly 25% of Syria, and the new government in Damascus led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. Inside the cells, the men wait for word on their own fate. A British prisoner from London, who asked that his name not be made public, said he wants to return to Britain and stand trial there. He was 18 when he came to Syria a decade ago after seeing media reports on 'the killings of kids' by Assad’s government forces during a popular uprising that turned into civil war. He said he later wanted to leave Syria but could not. 'Once you enter (IS), it's hard to leave,' he said. He claimed he had not been a fighter but instead bought and sold cars while living in IS-held areas. He said all men captured by the SDF in the Baghouz area in early 2019 were classified as IS members. Seven years have passed in detention. 'To survive a day in this place is a miracle,' he said, adding that he and fellow detainees know nothing of the world now, not even the date. Asked what day it was, he replied: 'We are in early 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-members-held-for-years-in-a-syria-prison-say-they-know-nothing-of-the-world-/7963554.html	2025-02-05T01:32:50-08:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drone attack sparks oil depot fire in Krasnodar	A Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire at an oil depot in Russia’s Krasnodar region, the area’s governor said Wednesday. The fire, which was later put out, happened in the village of Novominskaya. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said debris from a destroyed drone caused the fire, and that there were no injuries. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down two Ukrainian drones over the Kursk region and two more drones over Belgorod, both of which border Ukraine. Officials in Kursk reported damage to a building, but no casualties. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 57 of the 104 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said the attacks damaged several buildings and injured one person. Officials also reported damage to buildings in Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad and Sumy. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Tuesday that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid or substations could disrupt supply and pose the risk of a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi visited an electrical substation in Kyiv on Tuesday, saying on X that the structure is 'an important part of Ukraine's power grid essential for nuclear safety.' Grossi said that 'the situation is quite dire. ... We should not hide the fact that as you can see ... this infrastructure has been degraded.' He also said that he was 'impressed' with the work now being done 'to ensure nuclear safety.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-ukrainian-drone-attack-sparks-oil-depot-fire-in-krasnodar/7963534.html	2025-02-05T00:28:39-08:00	
India PM Modi's party seeks to oust anti-corruption crusader in New Delhi state elections	NEW DELHI — Thousands begin voting in the Indian capital’s state legislature election on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party trying to unseat a powerful regional group that has ruled New Delhi for over a decade. Voters walked to polling booths on a cold, wintry morning to cast their ballots across the sprawling capital. Manish Sisodia, a key Aam Aadmi Party leader, and others offered prayers in a temple before voting. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is up against the AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built a vast support base on its welfare policies and an anti-corruption movement. Kejriwal, a popular crusader against corruption, suffered a setback as he himself faced graft allegations. The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last election, held in 2020, leaving BJP with only eight and the Congress party with none. The AAP had also swept the 2015 state elections, winning 67 seats, with the BJP taking three. Modi and Kejriwal have both campaigned vigorously in roadshows with thousands of supporters tailing them. They have offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women. Voting ends later Wednesday, with results due on Saturday. More than 15 million people are eligible to vote in New Delhi's election. Arati Jerath, a political commentator, predicted a tight contest between the two parties, saying, 'Even since the AAP rose to prominence, it has been a one-sided contest.' Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people, is a federal territory that Modi’s party has not won for over 27 years despite having a sizable support base there. Kejriwal and other AAP leaders recently faced graft allegations in a liquor license case. Neerja Chowdhury, a political analyst, said the liquor policy case — in which several AAP leaders, including Kejriwal, went to jail — had dented Kejriwal's clean image. Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key leaders of his party ahead of national elections on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have consistently denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader. The BJP, which failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners, has gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states. Modi’s party hopes to benefit after last week’s federal budget slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocks. Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents, and pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures in the months before the national election. Kejriwal vowed to be an anti-corruption crusader and formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger against the then-Congress party government over a series of corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women. The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years. In the 2015 and 2020 elections in Delhi, the AAP won landslide victories.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-pm-modi-s-party-seeks-to-oust-anti-corruption-crusader-in-new-delhi-state-elections-/7963530.html	2025-02-05T00:17:30-08:00	
Decorated pilot Harry Stewart, Jr., one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, dies at 100	Retired Lt. Col. Harry Stewart Jr, a decorated World War II pilot who broke racial barriers as a Tuskegee Airmen and earned honors for his combat heroism, has died. He was 100. Stewart was one of the last surviving combat pilots of the famed 332nd Fighter Group also known as the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the nation’s first Black military pilots. The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum confirmed his death. The organization said he died peacefully at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Sunday. Stewart earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for downing three German aircraft during a dogfight on April 1, 1945. He was also part of a team of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the U.S. Air Force Top Gun flying competition in 1949, although their accomplishment would not be recognized until decades later. 'Harry Stewart was a kind man of profound character and accomplishment with a distinguished career of service he continued long after fighting for our country in World War II,' Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, said. Born on July 4, 1924, in Virginia, his family moved to New York when he was young. Stewart had dreamed of flying since he was a child when he would watch planes at LaGuardia airport, according to a book about his life titled 'Soaring to Glory: A Tuskegee Airmen’s Firsthand Account of World War II.' In the wake of Pearl Harbor, an 18-year-old Stewart joined what was then considered an experiment to train Black military pilots. The unit sometimes was also known as the Tuskegee Airmen for where they trained in Alabama or the Red Tails because of the red tips of their P-51 Mustangs. 'I did not recognize at the time the gravity of what we are facing. I just felt as though it was a duty of mine at the time. I just stood up to my duty,' Stewart said of World War II in a 2024 interview with CNN about the war. Having grown up in a multicultural neighborhood, the segregation and prejudice of the Jim Crow-era South came as a shock to Stewart, but he was determined to finish and earn his wings according to the book about his life. After finishing training, the pilots were assigned to escort U.S. bombers in Europe. The Tuskegee Airmen are credited with losing significantly fewer escorted bombers than other fighter groups. 'I got to really enjoy the idea of the panorama, I would say, of the scene I would see before me with the hundreds of bombers and the hundreds of fighter planes up there and all of them pulling the condensation trails, and it was just the ballet in the sky and a feeling of belonging to something that was really big,' Stewart said in a 2020 interview with WAMC. Stewart would sometimes say in a self-effacing way that he was too busy enjoying flying to realize he was making history, according to his book. Stewart had hoped to become a commercial airline pilot after he left the military, but was rejected because of his race. He went on to earn a mechanical engineering degree at New York University. He relocated to Detroit and retired as vice president of a natural gas pipeline company. Stewart told Michigan Public Radio in 2019 that he was moved to tears on a recent commercial flight when he saw who was piloting the aircraft. 'When I entered the plane, I looked into the cockpit there and there were two African American pilots. One was the co-pilot, and one was the pilot. But not only that, the thing that started bringing the tears to my eyes is that they were both female,' Stewart said. The Air Force last month briefly removed training courses with videos of its storied Tuskegee Airmen and the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs in an effort to comply with the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The materials were quickly restored following a bipartisan backlash.	https://www.voanews.com/a/decorated-pilot-harry-stewart-jr-one-of-the-last-surviving-tuskegee-airmen-dies-at-100-/7963520.html	2025-02-04T23:49:26-08:00	
Trump says US will take ownership of war-torn Gaza	U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the U.S. to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Gazans to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Trump made the stunning announcement Tuesday evening, as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-us-will-take-ownership-of-war-torn-gaza-/7963497.html	2025-02-04T21:41:20-08:00	
Trump says U.S. will take ownership of Gaza	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants the United States to take ownership of Gaza, moving beyond his earlier statements of forcing Palestinians in the war-torn enclave to relocate to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. 'The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,' he said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Tuesday evening. In recent days hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the southern parts of Gaza have marched north toward their homes after Israel allowed people to return as part of the ceasefire for a hostage release deal with Hamas. Trump said he wants to develop the area into what he calls 'the Riviera of the Middle East.' 'Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent, in a really magnificent area,' he said. Netanyahu said one of his war goals is to ensure that Hamas never poses a threat to Israel again. But Trump, Netanyahu said, is 'taking it to a much higher level.' 'I think it’s something that could change history, and it’s worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,' he added. Trump did not share details on how he plans to exert control over the area ravaged by 15 months of war, but he did not rule out sending U.S. troops. 'If it’s necessary, we’ll do that. We’re going to take over that piece, and we’re going to develop it,' he said. Trump’s comments mark a remarkable shift from his criticism of America’s involvement in Middle East conflicts. He sees a 'long-term ownership position,' for the U.S. that would bring 'great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East.' 'This was not a decision made lightly,' he said. However, any discussion of relocation will certainly be met with resistance from Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes in what is now called Israel: in the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and during Israel’s 1967 seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority and Arab League countries including Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia earlier this month rejected Trump’s plans to relocate Palestinians. They warned that such plans 'threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples.' It’s unclear how occupying Gaza would fit into Trump’s own stated goal of expanding the Abraham Accords to include Riyadh. He brokered the deal that normalized ties between Israel and Arab countries in 2020. Saudi Arabia has publicly said it would only agree to recognize Israel, if the Gaza war ends and Palestinians have a path to statehood. Earlier Tuesday when asked whether the Saudis are demanding a Palestinian state, Trump said, 'No they're not.' Trump’s statement on Gaza is his latest signaling of expansionist ambitions, following his statements to acquire Greenland from Denmark, taking over the Panama Canal, and absorbing Canada. Ceasefire renegotiation Speaking to reporters at the White House earlier Tuesday, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has begun negotiations toward Phase 2 of the three-phase ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Witkoff suggested that the administration is considering renegotiating parts of the agreement that took effect on Jan. 19, the day before Trump was inaugurated. 'Part of the problem is that it wasn’t such a wonderful agreement that was first signed. That was not dictated by the Trump administration. We had nothing to do with it,' he said. 'Now we’re working within that rubric, and we’re figuring things out.' He doubled down on Trump’s suggestion to remove Gazans, saying that the five-year reconstruction plan for Gaza as outlined in phase three is 'physically impossible.' Trump’s insistence on relocating Gazans could signal a desire to renegotiate the ceasefire deal, particularly the second phase, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. 'The goal might be to force Hamas into choosing between relinquishing control of Gaza or leaving the Strip if it wants an Israeli withdrawal or reconstruction, or risk the entirety of the population facing forcible removal, though how that would be carried out is unknown,' he told VOA. Also Tuesday, Trump ended support for the UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees and withdrew the U.S. from what he calls the antisemitic UN Human Rights Council. Iran nuclear Shortly before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump directed his aides to restore his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran to prevent it from getting a nuclear weapon and to drive down its oil exports to zero. 'I'm unhappy to do it, but I really have not so much choice, because we have to be strong and firm, and I hope that it's not going to have to be used in any great measure at all,' he said. 'It's very simple. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.' As of September 2024, U.S. intelligence concluded in a report that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. However, Iran has 'undertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses,' the report said. In November, the Justice Department under the Biden administration announced that an Iranian plot to kill Trump before the presidential election had been thwarted. Trump said he has directed his aides to 'obliterate' Tehran if the Iranian regime moves to assassinate him. 'If they did that they would be obliterated,' Trump said. 'I’ve left instructions if they do it, they get obliterated, there won’t be anything left.' Pressure on Netanyahu Trump’s meeting with Netanyahu comes as the Israeli leader faces pressure from his right-wing coalition to end the ceasefire. Both Trump and Netanyahu share the goal of ending Hamas’ rule in Gaza and return the remaining Israeli hostages, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Bar Ilan University. However, the two men place different priorities on different aspects of the goal. For Netanyahu, the priority is to ensure Hamas has no political future, Rynhold told VOA, while for Trump it’s to maintain the ceasefire 'so that he can move to an Israeli-Saudi Arabian normalization agreement.' U.S. administrations under Presidents George W. Bush to Joe Biden have stated their support for Palestinian statehood under the two-state solution. In 2020 during his first term, Trump announced his Middle East peace plan that would deny Palestinians having their own state. Trump was non-committal when asked Tuesday whether he supports the two-state solution. His plan on Gaza 'doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one-state or any other state,' he said. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 Hamas militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-u-s-will-take-ownership-of-gaza/7963488.html	2025-02-04T20:55:16-08:00

Senate confirms Pam Bondi as US attorney general	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general on Tuesday evening. The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass her confirmation 54-46. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been the target of Trump's ire over the criminal cases it brought against him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived adversaries. Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments. 'Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,' said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump's adversaries. And she has repeated Trump's claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice Department 'had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it's got to stop.' Bondi's confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved in the January 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to mass firings. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on the January 6 cases — which Trump has described as a 'grave national injustice.' Bove, who defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would carry out a 'review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.' Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the District of Columbia’s U.S. attorney's office who were hired to help with the massive Jan. 6 investigation. Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed Trump's campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-pam-bondi-as-us-attorney-general/7963471.html	2025-02-04T20:07:15-08:00	
High threat' undocumented migrants sent to Guantanamo	PENTAGON — A small number of migrants were transferred from Texas to a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Tuesday via U.S. military aircraft, U.S. defense officials told VOA. Fewer than 20 migrants, which the administration has deemed to be 'high threat,' are being transported on the first C-17 flight from Fort Bliss, one defense official said, speaking to VOA on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, before the flight landed in Cuba. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday posted photos on X of some of the migrants as they prepared to board the military cargo plane, calling them 'the worst of the worst,' and warning the effort to deport them is just getting started. The Department of Homeland Security later said all of the migrants on the military flight from Texas to Guantanamo Bay were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang with transnational reach. Officials did not say when or how they were first taken into custody. The White House has announced plans to designate Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Since President Donald Trump's executive order last month, the Pentagon has deployed 300 Marines to Guantanamo to expand the facilities to support holding operations for undocumented immigrants. According to media reports, they have set up tents to house the migrants inside a fenced area at a separate part of the naval base. Those facilities are not yet ready for migrants, according to Fox News. 'The number of service members will continue to fluctuate as additional forces are tasked to deploy and will be scaled, based on the requirements of the Department of Homeland Security, which is the lead federal agency,' U.S. Southern Command, which overseas operations in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, announced in a statement on Monday. The migrants who arrived Tuesday will be held at the U.S. detention facility, according to a U.S. official who spoke on background. The facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks and members of the Taliban. 'If you're a violent gang banger, and you've been taken out of our country, and we're waiting to bring you to your country, we're going to put you in a cell box built for al-Qaida,' Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told Fox News this week. In his executive order last month, Trump instructed the departments of Defense and Homeland Security to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. 'Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So, we're going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump said. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Barack Obama and Joe Biden had sought to close the detention camp, which was built by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson said. At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. As of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility, according to the Pentagon. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-threat-undocumented-migrants-sent-to-guantanamo/7963451.html	2025-02-04T19:36:11-08:00	
Analysts: American Iron Dome reduces nuclear coercion but drives arms race	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s order to build an American version of the Iron Dome to shield the U.S. from aerial attacks will deter China and Russia from coercing the U.S. using nuclear weapons but could drive a three-way arms race, said analysts. The U.S. government’s Missile Defense Agency on Friday asked the defense industry to identify technologies and capabilities available to construct the Iron Dome for America. The deadline is the end of February. It made the request in response to Trump’s executive order signed on Jan. 27, setting forth a motion to build an American Iron Dome. 'The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,' the executive order stated. The American Iron Dome will defend the U.S. 'against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries,' according to the statement. It will ensure the U.S. has 'its second-strike capability,' meaning it would be able to launch nuclear retaliation. The Iron Dome would also include a review of missile defense posture to identify ways for U.S. allies and partners to increase cooperation on missile defense development and operations. Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to draw up a plan in the next three months to build the missile shield. Strengthening deterrence Robert Peters, research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile Defense at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday via phone, the Iron Dome for America 'will take away the option for nuclear coercion that an actor could try to hold over the U.S.' in addition to defending the U.S. from an actual strike. 'It is feasible for us to build an Iron Dome,' he said, 'and there is no reason why we should not do so, particularly given that we are seeing the autocrats in North Korea, China, and Russia engaging in nuclear coercion.' Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons multiple times during an ongoing war in Ukraine that began with its invasion in 2022. In November, Putin revised the Russian threshold for using nuclear weapons in a doctrine issued after former U.S. President Joe Biden allowed Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-made longer-range missiles. The doctrine announced that Russia has the right to use nuclear weapons to respond to a conventional weapons attack. Previously, Russia reserved the right to use nuclear weapons only when an attack threatened its existence. Patrycja Bazylczyk, a research associate for the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, 'If implemented well, an ‘iron dome for America’ could bolster American defense and affect the strategic calculus of our adversaries.' She told VOA on Monday, 'Improving homeland air and missile defenses reduces the confidence of a potential attacker, thereby raising the threshold for attack and contributing to deterrence.' The Iron Dome plan resembles former President Ronald Reagon's proposed dual objective of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and nuclear disarmament, said Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). The SDI, also came to be called Star Wars, was announced in 1983 to develop a space-based defense system to protect the U.S. from nuclear missiles. Risk of arms race Trump's 'Iron Dome initiative, to some extent, echoes his concern about nuclear weapons,' but 'a stronger U.S. missile defense system would almost certainly make it more difficult to reach a nuclear agreement with Russia and China because of their concern that more effective missile defenses would increase the threat to their nuclear retaliatory capability,' continued Kristensen. Trump said in a video message to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 23 that he wants to discuss 'denuclearization' with Russia, and that China would need to come along. Kristensen told VOA on Thursday that 'FAS applauds Trump's remarks about the need for nuclear limits and eventually denuclearization and urge the administration to pursue these goals.' He added, 'Nuclear deterrence can be maintained with far fewer nuclear weapons' and having nuclear reduction talks is 'urgent because the New START treaty expires in about one year.' The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in February 2026. Daryl Kimball, executive director of Arms Control Association, told VOA on Friday Trump envisions 'more ambitious system to thwart strategic missile attacks by Russia or China' than his efforts in 2019. 'It is not realistic to believe that an effective system would be feasible anytime soon, if ever, mainly because adversaries will respond by seeking to overwhelm missile defense systems in order to maintain their own capacity to deter U.S. conventional or nuclear attack,' he said. Kimball added, however, 'We welcome Trump's interest in negotiating agreements with Russia and China to reduce the 'tremendous' costs of nuclear weapons by reducing or 'denuclearizing' with Russia and China. Without such a deal, we could see a costly three-way offensive nuclear arms races that no one can win.' The U.S. has about 5,044 nuclear warheads while Russia has over, 5,500 and China has approximately 500 nuclear warheads, according to the FAS. The Pentagon in its annual report released in December on China's military estimates that China will have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. North Korea, through its state-run KCNA, on Monday expressed opposition to the U.S. plan to build the Iron Dome, describing it as a 'hegemonic attempt to maintain its military supremacy.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA on Monday that it does not have any comments on the issue at this time. A top Russia diplomat quoted by the state news agency Tass on Thursday said America’s Iron Dome 'puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase.' Richard Weitz, director for the Center for Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute, said, 'The Russians and Chinese have always said that if the U.S. builds better defenses, they’re going to build better offenses so they can overcome these defenses.' He told VOA on Thursday, the Iron Dome effort, along with Trump’s interest in having nuclear reduction talks with China and Russia, aims to reduce overall threats to the U.S., but it would be difficult to get China on board denuclearization talks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-american-iron-dome-reduces-nuclear-coercion-but-drives-arms-race/7963461.html	2025-02-04T19:26:52-08:00	
US judge blocks Trump from sending transgender women to men's prisons	WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from moving transgender women to men's prisons and ending their gender-affirming care. In a broad ruling temporarily halting an executive order that Trump, a Republican, signed on his first day back in office on Jan. 20, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington found that three transgender inmates who sued would likely succeed in arguing the policy was unconstitutional. The decision marked the second time that a federal judge had sided with LGBTQ+ legal rights groups who sued to prevent the U.S. Bureau of Prisons from implementing the order. Lamberth's order applies to all 16 transgender women currently housed in federal women's prisons. It goes further than a Jan. 26 decision by a federal judge in Boston blocking prison officials from transferring an individual transgender woman to a men's facility. A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which defended the Trump administration in court, declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The three transgender women who brought the Washington case argued transgender women would face violence and sexual assault in men's prisons, which would violate their right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Justice Department attorney John Robinson had argued that the Bureau of Prisons has broad authority to make inmate placement decisions. He urged Lamberth, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, to wait for the agency to revise its policies before issuing any order compelling the continuation of medical treatment. In his decision, Lamberth wrote that the government did not dispute the plaintiffs' assertion that transgender persons were at a higher risk of physical and sexual violence than other inmates when housed in a facility corresponding to their biological sex. Trump's executive order directed the federal government to only recognize two, biologically distinct sexes, male and female; house transgender women in men's prisons; and cease funding for any gender-affirming medical care for inmates. Prior to Trump's order, the Bureau of Prisons had been operating under guidelines adopted in 2022 during Democratic former President Joe Biden's tenure requiring prisons to consider inmates' 'current gender expression' when deciding where to house them. Biden's policy was a reversal from earlier guidance during Trump's first term. The lawsuit filed on Jan. 30 also argued that Trump's executive order discriminates against transgender people on the basis of sex in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. About 2,230 transgender inmates are housed in federal custodial facilities and halfway houses, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. About two thirds of them, 1,506, are transgender women, most of whom are housed in men's prisons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-blocks-trump-from-sending-transgender-women-to-men-s-prisons/7963446.html	2025-02-04T18:48:03-08:00	
Trump takes aim at new South African land expropriation law	WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump has taken aim at a new South African law meant to address the nation’s apartheid legacy of racially unequal land distribution, threatening to withdraw funding, including to the world’s largest HIV treatment program. Africa observers told VOA on Tuesday that some members of the U.S. Congress have jumped on this grievance to 'upend the status quo in U.S.-South Africa relations as a response.' Trump fired the first volley Sunday night, in a post on his social media site. 'South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,' Trump wrote. He continued to describe the situation as 'a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum.' South African politicians — both the supporters and the opponents of the newly inked Expropriation Act that Trump was referring to — quickly fired back at his description of the new law, which repeals apartheid-era legislation to align land distribution with the nation’s progressive constitution. Under the apartheid system, laws such as the 1913 Natives Land Act severely restricted Black land ownership. Other now-defunct laws determined where members of the nation’s Black majority could travel or live, what public facilities they could use, and whom they could marry. Apartheid also denied full citizenship rights to Black people until its fall in the early 1990s. Black people first gained the right to vote in the 1994 elections that ushered in democratic rule. 'South Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners,' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement this week. 'We look forward to engaging with the Trump administration over our land reform policy and issues of bilateral interest. We are certain that out of those engagements, we will share a better and common understanding over these matters.' The new law allows for limited cases of land expropriation without compensation, and that clause alone provoked years of public consultations and debate in South African parliament and civil society before it was adopted recently by the nation’s newly sworn-in coalition government. In her article on the website The Conversation, law professor Zsa-Zsa Temmers Boggenpoel of Stellenbosch University explained the move as 'a potential tool to reduce land inequality.' 'This has become a matter of increasing urgency,' she wrote. 'South Africans have expressed impatience with the slow pace of land reform.' A government land audit in 2017 found that 72% of the country's farms and agricultural holdings were white-owned. 'I am not convinced that the act, in its current form, is the silver bullet to effect large-scale land reform — at least not the type of radical land reform that South Africa urgently needs,' Boggenpoel wrote. 'Understandably, the act will have a severe impact on property rights. But it still substantially protects landowners affected by expropriation. Only in very limited cases would they not be compensated.' South Africa's opposition parties stood against the new law. After the bill was signed last month, opposition party ActionSA , which vowed to pursue legal action, said in a statement, 'While other parties assert that this bill does not compromise the ‘willing buyer, willing seller doctrine,’ it ultimately allows the government to unilaterally set the price if an agreement cannot be reached.' The center-right Democratic Alliance party not only strenuously opposed the new law — along with ActionSA and the pro-Afrikaner Freedom Front Plus party — it also objected to Trump’s characterization, calling it 'unfortunate.' 'It would be a tragedy if this funding were terminated because of a misunderstanding of the facts,' the party said in a statement. It continued: 'It is not true that the Act allows land to be seized by the state arbitrarily, and it does require fair compensation for legitimate expropriations in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution.' But these nuances may not be seized upon by the U.S. Congress, which has bristled at some of Pretoria’s moves — not least, the nation’s decision to pursue a genocide case against Israel at the U.N.’s highest court, said Michael Walsh, an Africa analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, The U.S. strenuously opposed South Africa’s petition to the court in late 2023, with the White House telling VOA the case was 'without merit.' 'My key takeaway was [Trump's] reference to massive human rights violations,' Walsh told VOA. 'That terminology will play into the hands of those interest groups who have been pushing for Magnitsky sanctions to be imposed on ANC and EFF officials prior to the G20 Johannesburg Summit,' he added, referring to the African National Congress, Ramaphosa's party, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. The 2012 Magnitsky Act allows the U.S. to impose sanctions on human rights violators. 'Many South African experts have assumed that any Magnitsky sanctions would be based on acts of corruption,' Walsh said. 'However, members of Congress are considering Magnitsky sanctions on the grounds of human rights violations as well.' This all sets up the scene, he said, for a diplomatic showdown when world leaders converge in Johannesburg in November for the summit of G20 nations. Host nation South Africa has set the agenda for that meeting of the world’s top 20 economies to include two issues that don’t jibe with Trump’s isolationist, pro-energy exploration, America-first approach: mobilizing climate financing and increasing debt relief for developing countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-takes-aim-at-new-south-african-land-expropriation-law/7963443.html	2025-02-04T18:41:26-08:00	
US Treasury says Musk team has 'read-only access' to payment data	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday that Elon Musk's government-efficiency team has been granted 'read-only access' to its payment system codes and denied that this cut off any government payments including for Social Security or Medicare. The confirmation of a Musk associate's access to the system codes came in a letter from a Treasury official to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden. The letters said the review was being undertaken to 'maximize payment integrity for agencies and the public.' Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has not commented on reports in recent days that Musk's informal Department of Government Efficiency had gained access to the system responsible for disbursing more than $6 trillion of annual government spending. Several thousand people gathered outside the Treasury on Tuesday to protest DOGE's Treasury access amid his sweeping incursion into government operations, which this week led to the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, merging its aid mission into the State Department. The payment system review 'is not resulting in the suspension or rejection of any payment instructions submitted to Treasury by other federal agencies across the government,' Jonathan Blum, principal deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Legislative Affairs wrote to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. The DOGE team at Treasury conducting the review is led by technology firm chief executive Tom Krause, whom the letter described as a 'Treasury employee.' Krause is CEO of Cloud Software Group, which owns former independent software firms Citrix and Tibco. Wyden raised alarms over the weekend when reports first surfaced that a team under the direction of Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to conduct a broad review of government operations, was at the Treasury. 'I'm sure the Treasury Secretary and the president want to save face and downplay the risks as Elon Musk seizes power, but nothing they're saying is believable or trustworthy,' Wyden said in response to Blum's letter. Outside the Treasury, protesters waved placards with slogans including: 'Nobody Elected Musk' and 'Bessent, you have 1 job!! Protect our money. You already failed.' About three dozen Democratic members of the Senate and House of Representatives tried to enter the Treasury to confront Bessent on the issue but they said they were denied access. Rebecca Weiss, who lives in suburban Maryland, told Reuters that she attended the protest because she is worried about what Musk will do with the payments data. 'He's obviously a data guy, and now he has access, potentially, to everybody's personal identifiable information, which he might take advantage of for his business purposes,' she said. 'The bottom line is, we didn't elect him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-says-musk-team-has-read-only-access-to-payment-data-/7963412.html	2025-02-04T18:15:15-08:00	
Trump reimposes 'maximum pressure' on Iran, aims to drive oil exports to zero	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday restored his 'maximum pressure' campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump signed the presidential memorandum reimposing Washington's tough policy on Iran that was practiced throughout his first term. As he signed the memo, Trump described it as very tough and said he was torn on whether to make the move. He said he was open to a deal with Iran and expressed a willingness to talk to the Iranian leader. 'With me, it's very simple: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,' Trump said. Asked how close Tehran is to a weapon, Trump said: 'They're too close.' Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran is accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief told Reuters in December. Iran has denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. Trump's memo, among other things, orders the U.S. Treasury secretary to impose 'maximum economic pressure' on Iran, including sanctions and enforcement mechanisms on those violating existing sanctions. It also directs the Treasury and State Department to implement a campaign aimed at 'driving Iran's oil exports to zero.' U.S. oil prices pared losses on Tuesday on the news that Trump planned to sign the memo. Tehran's oil exports brought in $53 billion in 2023 and $54 billion a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. Output during 2024 was running at its highest level since 2018, based on OPEC data. Trump had driven Iran's oil exports to near-zero during part of his first term after re-imposing sanctions. They rose under Biden's tenure as Iran succeeded in evading sanctions. The Paris-based International Energy Agency believes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members have spare capacity to make up for any lost exports from Iran, also an OPEC member. China does not recognize U.S. sanctions and Chinese firms buy the most Iranian oil. China and Iran have also built a trading system that uses mostly Chinese yuan and a network of middlemen, avoiding the dollar and exposure to U.S. regulators. Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy, said the Trump administration could enforce the 2024 Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum (SHIP) law to curtail some Iranian barrels. SHIP, which the Biden administration did not enforce strictly, allows measures on foreign ports and refineries that process petroleum exported from Iran in violation of sanctions. Book said a move last month by the Shandong Port Group to ban U.S.-sanctioned tankers from calling into its ports in the eastern Chinese province signals the impact SHIP could have. Trump also directed his U.N. ambassador to work with allies to 'complete the snapback of international sanctions and restrictions on Iran,' under a 2015 deal between Iran and key world powers that lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. Britain, France and Germany told the United Nations Security Council in December that they are ready — if necessary — to trigger a snapback of all international sanctions on Iran to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They will lose the ability to take such action on October 18 when a 2015 U.N. resolution expires. The resolution enshrines Iran's deal with Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran's U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, has said that invoking the 'snap-back' of sanctions on Tehran would be 'unlawful and counterproductive.' European and Iranian diplomats met in November and January to discuss if they could work to defuse regional tensions, including over Tehran's nuclear program, before Trump returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-reimposes-maximum-pressure-on-iran-aims-to-drive-oil-exports-to-zero/7963388.html	2025-02-04T17:31:54-08:00	
Former Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese companies	U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for. Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine. The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration. The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially threatening national security. Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models. Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia. Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company. Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country's policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry. Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement. According to court records describing a December 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a 'potential resolution' to Ding's case, 'but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.' The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-google-engineer-faces-new-us-charges-he-stole-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies-/7963387.html	2025-02-04T17:18:06-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Fake stock exchange scams steal millions from Kurdistan region	Millions of dollars have been taken from people in the Kurdistan Region through fake stock exchange companies. According to Mohammed Hussein from the Iraqi Economists Network, some websites were created to trade commodities internationally, but they were scams that stole people's money. Experts say the lack of laws to regulate online trading in Iraq and Kurdistan has allowed these scams to grow. Many people without financial experience invest in the stock market and lose large amounts of money, while some companies sell far more than their actual value.

Syria's Sharaa meets with Turkey's Erdogan	Syria's new interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa on Tuesday met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where they discussed improved security ties and how to respond to Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria. Sharra flew into Turkey from Saudi Arabia where he sought Riyadh's funding to rebuild Syria after a devastating 13-year civil war. After meeting with Sharaa, Erdogan said, 'I would like to express our satisfaction for the strong commitment my brother Ahmed al-Sharaa has shown in the fight against terrorism.' As leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS — long considered a terrorist group by U.S. officials — Sharaa led a campaign in December to wrest control of Damascus from ex-President Bashar al-Assad, whose flight to Russia ended more than a half-century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Turkey was a solid ally to the forces seeking to oust Assad, including Sharaa and HTS. Among the topics discussed in Tuesday's meeting were the Syrian Kurdish militias in northeastern Syria, where U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been fighting Turkish-backed forces. Turkey shares a 910-kilometer border with Syria and wants the SDF, which Turkey views as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers, disbanded and removed from border regions. Syria's new rulers are reported to have called on SDF to relinquish their weapons. In an Associated Press report, SDF commander Mazloun Abdi said he recently met with Sharaa in Damascus and that negotiations are underway with mediators to find answers regarding the future of Syrian Kurds. In addition, Turkey has also called for the removal of Islamic State militants in Syria. Erdogan said he told Sharaa that Turkey is 'ready to provide the necessary support to Syria in the fight against all kinds of terrorism.' Also Tuesday, Syria's new leader invited Turkey's president to visit Syria 'at the earliest opportunity.' Sharaa also thanked Turkey for taking in millions of Syrians who fled their homeland during the civil war. He said Syria would 'never forget [Turkey's] historic stance.' 'That significant support is still tangible through Turkey's ongoing efforts to ensure the success of the current leadership in Syria, politically and economically,' Sharaa said. Some information was provided from the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-sharaa-meets-with-turkey-s-erdogan/7963366.html	2025-02-04T16:54:58-08:00	
Trump orders target several UN bodies	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stopped U.S. engagement with the U.N. Human Rights Council, extended a halt to funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. 'It's got great potential and based on the potential we'll continue to go along with it, but they got to get their act together,' Trump told reporters. 'It's not being well run, to be honest and they're not doing the job. 'A lot of these conflicts that we're working on should be settled, or at least we should have some help in settling them. We never seem to get help. That should be the primary purpose of the United Nations,' the U.S. president said. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, 'From day one, U.S. support for the United Nations has saved countless lives and advanced global security.' 'The secretary-general looks forward to continuing his productive relationship with President Trump and the U.S. government to strengthen that relationship in today's turbulent world.' Trump said that he was not looking to take away money from the 193-member world body, though he complained that Washington had to pay a disproportionate amount. Washington is the U.N.'s largest contributor - followed by China - accounting for 22% of the core U.N. budget and 27% of the peacekeeping budget. The U.N. has said the U.S. currently owes a total of $2.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion is for the regular budget. These payments are not voluntary. UNRWA Trump's order on Tuesday was largely symbolic and mirrored moves he made during his first term in office, from 2017-2021. Since taking office for a second term on Jan. 20, Trump has ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the World Health Organization and from the Paris climate agreement - also steps he took during his first term in office. The U.S. was UNRWA's biggest donor - providing $300 million-$400 million a year - but former President Joe Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking part in the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Palestinian militants Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza. The U.S. Congress then formally suspended contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and were fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had a UNRWA job. The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided. Human Rights Council The first Trump administration also quit the 47-member Human Rights Council halfway through a three-year term over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. The U.S. is not currently a member of the Geneva-based body. Under Biden, the U.S. was re-elected and served a 2022-2024 term. A council working group is due to review the U.S. human rights record later this year, a process all countries undergo every few years. While the council has no legally binding power, its debates carry political weight and criticism can raise global pressure on governments to change course. Trump's executive order on Tuesday also asks Secretary of State Marco Rubio to review and report back to him on international organizations, conventions, or treaties that 'promote radical or anti-American sentiment.' He specified that the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should be reviewed first because Washington had previously accused it of anti-Israel bias.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-target-several-un-bodies/7963365.html	2025-02-04T16:45:26-08:00	
Congressional Democrats to Trump: Changes can't be done in secrecy	Congressional Democratic leadership warned President Donald Trump on Tuesday that they would use upcoming government funding talks as leverage to fight the administration's changes in U.S. government agencies. Democrats' warnings come as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, moved the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) under the control of the U.S. State Department earlier this week. The administration has said they are reviewing USAID’s foreign assistance activities to 'ensure it is in alignment with an America First agenda.' 'Whatever DOGE is doing, it's not democracy,' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Tuesday. 'We know what democracy looks like. It's out in the open. It's not secret.' Democrats could push back on some of the most recent changes in the U.S. government by withholding votes on a new spending bill. A short-term continuing resolution keeping the government running is set to expire on March 14. On Monday, congressional Democrats protested outside closed USAID offices, saying the Trump administration had overreached its authority. 'If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law,' Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said. 'You cannot wave away an agency that you don't like or that you disagree with by executive order, or by literally storming into the building and taking over the servers. That is not how the American system of government works.' USAID manages tens of billions of dollars in U.S. foreign assistance programs. 'The Constitution requires that the funding be spent by the president and the administration,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. 'The Constitution requires the president has a responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Spending agreements passed through the appropriations process are law, and when those laws are violated, the Constitution is being violated, which is why there has been a flurry of righteous litigation that has been unleashed.' Congressional Republicans have expressed support for attempts to weed out fraud and abuse in the U.S. aid system. 'I don't think they're closing an agency, but I do think they have the right to review funding and how those decisions are made and what priorities are being funded,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday. 'I think that's probably true of any administration. When they come in, there are lots of programs authorized and funded through that agency, some which I think are operating the way in which they were intended, some which aren't.' The White House criticized USAID-funded projects supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and other efforts it argues are a waste of taxpayer funds. 'If there's massive fraud, if the funds aren't being directed to where the Congress has appropriated and the president has signed, then we need to know about that,' Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services chairman, told American news networks CNN and CBS Monday. 'I have felt for a long time that USAID is our way to combat the Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's effort to really gain influence around the world, including Africa and South America and the Western Hemisphere,' Wicker continued. 'So we need an aid program to match the Chinese effort, but it needs to be done in a way that the policymakers of the United States have decided ought to be done.' Schumer said Tuesday he's supportive of efforts to eliminate fraud and abuse but criticized the speed and secrecy of the process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congressional-democrats-to-trump-changes-can-t-be-done-in-secrecy-/7963362.html	2025-02-04T16:32:18-08:00

VOA Mandarin: China retaliates by imposing tariffs on US goods	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Chinese government on Tuesday launched four consecutive trade measures against the United States, including 10%-15% tariffs, an antitrust investigation on Google, a blacklist of two U.S. companies, and export controls on five types of metals. Analysts said that Beijing's four consecutive countermeasures were intended not only to retaliate against the United States but also to increase bargaining chips in negotiations with the U.S. Click here for the full story in Mandarin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-mandarin-china-retaliates-by-imposing-tariffs-on-us-goods-/7963047.html	2025-02-04T14:41:37-08:00	
Rubio pledges US support for Costa Rica's fight against cyberattacks, drug trafficking	STATE DEPARTMENT — Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday pledged U.S. support to bolster Costa Rica's cybersecurity defenses, 5G telecommunications infrastructure, and its battle against narcotics. Rubio made the statement at a joint press conference with Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves, whose Central American nation faces more than 100 million cyberattacks annually. 'It's very serious — 110 million cyberattacks a year for a country of this size — it's extraordinary, and they have faced it very bravely,' Rubio told reporters in San Jose, Costa Rica's capital. In late 2024, local media reported that Costa Rican officials, in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, identified cyber intrusions by criminal groups in China targeting the country's telecommunications and technology system, an allegation the Chinese Embassy in Costa Rica denied. In August 2023, Chaves issued a decree regulating 5G mobile network development, limiting involvement to companies based in signatory-states to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime — an international treaty addressing cybercrime. San Jose should be lauded for being 'very firm,' Rubio said, against companies 'backed by governments like the government of China that likes to threaten, that likes to sabotage, that likes to use economic coercion to punish you.' VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment but has not yet received a response. US aid waiver Rubio also vowed that Washington wouldn't 'eliminate foreign aid' but prioritize assistance for trusted partners and allies. He pledged continued cooperation with Costa Rica, offering FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration support to investigate drug trafficking to the U.S. 'We issued a waiver today because Costa Rica' has used U.S. aid effectively to fix problems that also benefit the United States, Rubio said. 'They're stopping drugs, they're stopping criminals, they're identifying terrorists.' The State Department's Office of Foreign Assistance has not responded to VOA's inquiry for further details on the waiver. Rubio's five-nation tour across Central America and the Caribbean marks his first major diplomatic mission as secretary of state, with key priorities including curbing illegal immigration into the U.S. and combating drug trafficking. On Tuesday afternoon, the secretary arrived in Guatemala following discussions with leaders from Panama, El Salvador and Costa Rica. He is scheduled to travel to the Dominican Republic on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-pledges-us-support-for-costa-rica-s-fight-against-cyberattacks-drug-trafficking-/7963015.html	2025-02-04T14:21:34-08:00

Nigeria announces measures to soften impact of USAID programs' suspension	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian officials have launched a committee to develop a transition and sustainability plan for USAID-funded health programs following U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day halt of most foreign aid. The multi-ministerial committee aims to secure new financial support for critical health programs. Nigeria’s health minister said the committee—comprising officials from the ministries of finance, health, and environment—intends to ensure that patients receiving treatment for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria do not experience setbacks amid the uncertainty over U.S. foreign policy. Shortly after taking office two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a 90-day pause on U.S. foreign aid. But days later, he approved a temporary waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance, covering medicine, medical services, food, and shelter. Despite the exemption, concerns remain over the future of U.S. funding for global health programs. Public health expert Ejike Orji welcomed Nigeria’s proactive response to the U.S. funding freeze. 'What this means is that they're going to do a review, situation assessment of what's going on and that would give them the opportunity to make recommendations to the government. They (U.S.) gave a ninety-day review because of the strategic importance of continuing the HIV program in Nigeria, so that means there's still a possibility after their review, they might say, ‘Look, we don't want to continue this funding,' said Orji. Nigeria is a significant recipient of U.S. foreign aid, receiving $1.02 billion in 2023, much of it through agencies like USAID. USAID funding to Nigeria plays a pivotal role in HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child care, and disease prevention efforts. On Monday, the Nigerian Federal Executive Council approved $1 billion for healthcare sector reforms and allocated an additional $3.2 million to procure 150,000 HIV treatment packs over the next four months. Authorities said the new funding will support improvements in primary healthcare services, maternal and child healthcare, and training of healthcare professionals. But Ndeayo Iwot, general secretary of the Health Sector Reforms Coalition, said it will be difficult to sustain those programs without continued U.S. support. 'Even when they're releasing the available funds on time, they will not be able to cover all the areas that those funds [aid] were helping them to achieve. It will take time, probably two, three years,' said Iwot. Approximately 1.8 million Nigerians are living with HIV. The country also accounts for the world's highest number of malaria deaths and ranks among the top countries for tuberculosis cases. Iwot said Nigeria needs new partnerships for health programs. 'Health needs a multi sectoral approach, it works on partnerships, there are certain things you shouldn't do alone as a country. Going through resource pulling from many partners and stakeholders is a recommended approach to financing health activities,' said Iwot. Currently, only about 4% of Nigeria’s annual budget is allocated to the health sector—far below the 15 percent target set by African leaders in the 2001 Abuja Declaration. It's unclear whether the U.S. will reverse its decision after the 90-day pause. But with uncertainty looming, analysts say careful implementation of policies and new partnerships may be Nigeria’s best path forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-announces-measures-to-soften-impact-of-usaid-programs-suspension/7962960.html	2025-02-04T13:07:13-08:00

Trump, Xi to discuss tariffs imposed on each other's exports	U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set soon to hold a high-stakes phone call on the tit-for-tat tariffs each has imposed on the other country’s exports. Trump’s new 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect at midnight Monday, with China quickly announcing it would impose 15% tariffs on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, as well as 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some automobiles. Trump on Monday retreated for a month from imposing 25% tariffs on most exports from the United States’ other top-three trading partners, Mexico and Canada. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to increase efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, the deadly opioid that has killed several hundred thousand Americans over recent years. Trump said he imposed the tariff on Chinese exports to pressure China to take action to prevent fentanyl smuggling into the U.S., which identified China as a major source of the precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl. China said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and other illicit drug trade. 'China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,' Trump said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s call with Xi 'is being scheduled and will happen very soon.' The U.S. and China, the world’s two biggest economies, engaged in an escalating trade war in 2018 during Trump’s first term in office when he repeatedly raised tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing responded each time. This time, China is much better prepared, analysts say. The country announced numerous measures that go beyond tariffs and cut across different sectors of the U.S. economy. China is also more wary of upsetting its own fragile and heavily trade-dependent economy. China's tariffs and other moves China’s State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement announcing its levy on U.S. products, 'The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization. It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.' But the impact on U.S. exports could be limited. Although the U.S. worldwide is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas, it does not export much to China. In 2023, the U.S. exported 173,247 million cubic feet of LNG to China, about 2.3% of its total natural gas exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. China imported fewer than 110,000 vehicles from the U.S. last year, although auto market analyst Lei Xing told The Associated Press that the tariffs could be painful for General Motors, which is adding the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon to its China lineup, and for Ford, which exports the Mustang and F-150 Raptor pickup. In addition to the tariff hike, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they are essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption. The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on such key elements as gallium. The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an unreliable entities list: PVH Group, which owns clothing companies Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, which is a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing could bar them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. The ministry said its investigations show the two U.S. companies have 'disrupted normal business with Chinese companies, taken discriminatory measures against Chinese companies and severely harmed the legitimate rights of Chinese companies.' Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September 2024 over what it described as 'improper Xinjiang-related behavior' after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton. Illumina competes with the Chinese biotech firm BGI in gene-sequencing. In a statement, Illumina said it complies with regulations wherever it operates. 'We are assessing this announcement with the goal of finding a positive resolution,' the company said. Mexico and Canada tariffs On Monday, Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of drugs into the United States. 'Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,' she posted on X after talking with Trump. 'The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along its southern border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl. 'I just had a good call with President Trump,' Trudeau said on X. 'Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.' Effects on US consumers Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods but said the higher tariffs would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers, rather than absorb the extra expenses themselves. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-xi-to-discuss-tariffs-imposed-on-each-other-s-exports/7962932.html	2025-02-04T13:00:16-08:00	
Trump pick for intelligence chief edges closer to confirmation	WASHINGTON — Former Democratic congresswoman turned President Donald Trump supporter Tulsi Gabbard is one step closer to leading the U.S. intelligence community following a party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee. All nine Republicans on the committee voted late Tuesday to send Gabbard's nomination to serve as director of national intelligence for a vote before the full Senate. The committee's eight Democrats voted against Gabbard's nomination. Trump praised Gabbard's 'fearless spirit' when he first nominated her for the top U.S. intelligence post in November. But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii, and a one-time Democratic presidential candidate, has faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who have questioned her experience and some of her past statements. 'It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard's confirmation hearing last week. During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by both Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him. But each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer. 'Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security,' Gabbard said during one exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford. Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 'I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications,' said committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat. 'Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.' In the days since the hearing, however, Gabbard managed to find common ground with the committee's Republican senators. 'In response to my questions during our discussion in my office and at the open hearing, as well as through her explanation at the closed hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ms. Gabbard addressed my concerns regarding her views on Edward Snowden,' Republican Susan Collins said in a statement late Monday. 'I look forward to working with Ms. Gabbard to strengthen our national security,' Collins added. Republican Senator Todd Young, likewise, voiced his backing for Gabbard's nomination early Tuesday, before the committee's vote. 'I appreciate Tulsi Gabbard's engagement with me on a variety of issues to ensure that our intelligence professionals will be supported, and policymakers will receive unbiased information under her leadership,' Young posted on social media platform X. 'Having now secured these commitments, I will support Tulsi's nomination.' Young also shared a letter from Gabbard, in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to 'not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.' Gabbard, in the letter, further promised to not make any recommendation 'regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden' to the U.S. attorney general or to President Trump. And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pick-for-intelligence-chief-edges-closer-to-confirmation/7962928.html	2025-02-04T12:48:03-08:00	
Man charged with stabbing Salman Rushdie goes on trial; author to take stand	MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran toward him and plunged a knife into the author’s hand as he raised it in self-defense. 'After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,' Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. 'I feel my legs give way, and I fall.' In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar. Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault. Under different circumstances, Rushdie’s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged. But 'this isn’t a back-alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,' said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. 'This is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.' Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half. Matar’s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal. 'That's not what this is about. It's about due process,' Barone said. 'It's about receiving a fair trial. ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.' In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization’s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death. A separate trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo. Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could. But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder. Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial. Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents. Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group’s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah. But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn’t anticipate needing to show Matar’s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges. 'From my standpoint, this is a localized event. It’s a stabbing event. It’s fairly straightforward,' Schmidt said. 'I don’t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that’s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I’d like to avoid all of that.' Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings. 'They’ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So, it’s kind of like the barn door’s been opened,' he said. Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016. Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event’s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, also was wounded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-charged-with-stabbing-salman-rushdie-goes-on-trial-author-to-take-stand-/7962880.html	2025-02-04T12:12:16-08:00	
El Salvador joins UN-backed mission on the ground in Haiti to combat gang violence	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A contingent from El Salvador arrived in Haiti on Tuesday to bolster a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to help fight gangs that killed thousands of people last year and control much of the capital. The 70 personnel will provide expertise in air support, which Kenyan officials said will be critical for medical evacuations. The Salvadoreans are the latest to join the mission in recent months. Additional police officers from Kenya were deployed last month for a total of more than 600 now in Haiti. They have been joined by police, soldiers and other officials from countries including Jamaica and Guatemala. Gang violence keeps surging across Port-au-Prince and beyond, with gunmen in recent days killing at least 40 people in an upscale community. The U.S. and other countries have warned that the Kenya-led mission lacks funding and personnel as they push to transform it into a U.N.-peacekeeping mission. More than 5,600 people were reported killed last year across Haiti and more than 2,200 others were injured. Gang violence has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-joins-un-backed-mission-on-the-ground-in-haiti-to-combat-gang-violence/7962828.html	2025-02-04T11:31:26-08:00

Doug Collins confirmed as veterans affairs secretary as Trump Cabinet takes shape	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs, putting the former congressman and Iraq War veteran at the helm of a department that provides crucial care to America's veterans. Collins, a former Air Force chaplain, was confirmed on a 77-23 vote, becoming the latest addition to President Donald Trump's Cabinet. 'We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our active duty service members, veterans, and military families to ensure they have the support they need,' Trump said in a November statement announcing Collins' nomination. The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters. Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans. The challenges facing the department have evolved in recent years, with a younger generation of veterans bringing new health challenges from their service in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. 'I'm an Iraq War veteran. I understand burn pits because I slept next to one for many months,' Collins said in his opening remarks during his January confirmation hearing. Collins said that he understands the challenges facing veterans today who 'went time and time again, deployment after deployment' to conflict zones. Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association. Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, called Collins a 'friend' who has 'an engaging personality that attracts people to what he's working on.' 'It's not that they're better doctors or better psychiatrists or better nurses or technicians. It's that they're empathetic,' Cramer said. 'While they appreciate access to community care, they appreciate the empathy of a fellow veteran, and Doug brings that. But, guys, he's a chaplain. I mean, come on, how perfect is that?' Collins' nomination sailed through the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in a 18-1 vote. The lone dissenter, Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said she was concerned that Collins would limit access to reproductive care like IVF or abortion for veterans. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said she had a productive conversation with Collins during his confirmation hearing but pressed him on whether he'd commit to working with Congress to 'strengthen and refine' the department 'rather than resorting to privatization.' Collins said he would be focused on addressing wait times and increasing preventative care.	https://www.voanews.com/a/doug-collins-confirmed-as-veterans-affairs-secretary-as-trump-cabinet-takes-shape/7962717.html	2025-02-04T10:34:39-08:00

As quakes rattle Greek islands, a few brave tourists enjoy having Santorini to themselves	Santorini, Greece — More Greek islands closed schools Tuesday as hundreds of earthquakes rattled the Aegean Sea, while a handful of hardy tourists enjoyed having Santorini's stunning views to themselves. Thousands of residents and seasonal workers have left the Cycladic Islands as hundreds of quakes up to magnitude 5 were recorded in the volcanic region since Friday. Ferry and commercial flight operators added services to accommodate departures. The quakes have caused cracks in some older buildings but no injuries have been reported so far. On Tuesday, schools were shut on 13 islands, up from four the previous day. Santorini earlier canceled public events, restricted travel to the island and banned construction work in certain areas. Efthimios Lekkas, head of the state-run Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, said that the epicenter of earthquakes in the Aegean Sea was moving northward away from Santorini, emphasizing that there was no connection to the area's dormant volcanoes. 'This may last several days or several weeks. We are not able to predict the evolution of the sequence in time,' Lekkas told state-run television. In Santorini's main town, Fira, the narrow, whitewashed streets along the island's clifftops were deserted — a rare sight even in the offseason — except for small pockets of tour groups, many from Asian countries. Joseph Liu, from Guangzhou in southern China, said that he had wanted to visit Santorini for years after seeing it in a documentary. He joined family and tour group members on a balcony deck typically used for high-end wedding receptions. 'This place is amazing, really beautiful. Just like I saw in the program: the mystery, the scenery,' he said. 'The [group] leader told us about the earthquakes before we came so it was not a surprise.' Retired police officer and ship worker Panagiotis Hatzigeorgiou, who has lived on Santorini for more than three decades, said that he has turned down offers to stay with relatives in Athens. 'Older residents are used to the earthquakes ... But it's different this time. It's not the same to have earthquakes every 2-3 minutes. The main thing is not to worry,' he said, adding with a laugh: 'Now we can listen to music alone and have coffee by ourselves.' In Athens, government officials are continuing to hold daily high-level planning and assessment meetings with briefings from island officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-quakes-rattle-greek-islands-a-few-brave-tourists-enjoy-having-santorini-to-themselves/7962618.html	2025-02-04T09:26:52-08:00	
M23 declares ceasefire in DRC as regional leaders try to forge peace	NAIROBI — The rebel group M23 declared a ceasefire in areas under its control in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, citing humanitarian reasons. The streets of Goma were busy as aid groups rushed Tuesday to help the thousands of people wounded and displaced during the past week’s fighting between M23 and pro-Congolese government forces. The M23 group also halted its military advance in other areas, most notably around the South Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu, where M23 fighters are stationed a few kilometers from the town. Chrispin Mvano, a political and security expert in Goma, told VOA that people there were going about their business peacefully. According to Mvano, residents in the city center reported seeing numerous trucks carrying petrol and other goods from Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda, and many people who fled the conflict were returning. The M23 ceasefire comes hours after the East African Community, or EAC, and Southern Africa Regional Community agreed to hold a joint summit to discuss the conflict in Congo, in hopes of bridging the differences between Kinshasa and Rwanda. Congo accuses Kigali of supporting the M23, a claim denied by Rwanda but verified by U.N. observers. According to U.N. agencies, 770 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma, and 2,880 were injured in the conflict. The Red Cross said Monday that it will need four more days to collect the bodies. Due to a lack of morgue space, it said, all bodies will be buried after identification. Hassane Hamdou, the Norwegian Refugee Council regional director for central and west Africa, said the ceasefire is only a first step, as it will take lasting peace to bring relief in eastern Congo and allow lifesaving assistance to reach those who are in desperate need. Stephane Dujjaric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said U.N. agencies are assessing the situation and are developing a plan to distribute humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Congo and neighboring countries. The U.N. humanitarian affairs office is calling for the urgent reopening of the Goma airport to help with evacuation of the injured and delivery of medical supplies. The agency said those involved in the conflict must guarantee access to humanitarian aid and supplies to people in need. Mvano warned that the ceasefire remains fragile, as other armed groups in eastern Congo could spoil the lull in fighting. For example, the Wazalendo group frequently disrupts peace efforts, Mvano said, adding that it’s important to remember that these rebel groups, who are not part of the negotiations, refuse to recognize the ceasefire agreement. Eastern Congo is home to more than 100 armed groups fighting for land, resources and control of the area’s rich mines. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who boycotted an EAC summit last week, is expected to attend the regional summit scheduled for Friday and Saturday, as is Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Tanzania will host the meeting, but some leaders may attend online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-declares-ceasefire-in-drc-as-regional-leaders-try-to-forge-peace-/7962611.html	2025-02-04T09:08:09-08:00

Chadians who worked for now-departed French troops appeal to government for jobs	Yaounde, Cameroon — More than 400 civilians rendered jobless by the departure of French troops from Chad are asking the government to hire them and provide the job benefits they had when they worked for the French. The last French troops left Chad on January 31, following an order by President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Chadian officials say hundreds of civilians who were employed by the French assembled in the capital N'djamena on Monday to ask the government to immediately give them jobs. French forces departed Chad at the order of the central African state’s president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby. The last French troops left the country on Friday after handing over the Kossei military base in N'djamena, which they had occupied for about 70 years. Earlier, French forces handed over two other bases at Faya-Largeau and Abeche. Mbaitoubam Bruno, the spokesperson for civilians who worked at the French military bases, spoke to VOA from N'djamena via a messaging app. He said Chad's government should immediately recruit them because at least half of the over 400 Chadians who lost their jobs as French troops departed are already in precarious situations that do not permit them to support their families. Mbaitoubam added that it is imperative for Chad's government to guarantee the security and social well-being of all former workers at French military bases by making sure each and every one of them has a job. The former workers mostly held jobs in hospitals, schools and dining facilities that served the French troops. Others provided humanitarian assistance to those who lived around the bases. Mbaitoubam said a majority of the workers were asked to leave French military bases on November 28 when Chad announced an end to military cooperation with France. The workers say they have remained without jobs and salaries and cannot take care of their medical bills. Aziz Mahamat Saleh is a member of a Chadian commission overseeing the dismantling of military agreements between Paris and N'Djamena. He is also Chad's former communications minister and government spokesman. He said Chad's president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby, ordered the commission to make a census of all civilians who worked with French troops in three bases at Kossei, Faya-Largeau and Abeche. He says after the census, the commission will propose a list of workers whose services are needed to the government of Chad for recruitment. Mahamat spoke on Chad's state TV. He said Deby has asked health and humanitarian workers to continue working in hospitals formerly controlled by French troops. He said he was pleading with the former workers to have confidence in their government, which he said is doing everything possible to protect their rights and provide jobs despite the difficult economic situation the country is facing. The workers say that under the French, they earned an average salary of more than 130 dollars per month. Before leaving Chad last week, General Pascal Ianni, the commander of French forces in Africa, told Chadian state TV that their departure was abrupt. Paris has not said anything concerning the former workers, Chad's government says. The workers say the decision to order out the French may have been patriotic for the government, but that it undermined their well-being, and did not take into consideration the needs of several thousand civilians who had health care and education thanks to the French troops’ presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadians-who-worked-for-now-departed-french-troops-appeal-to-government-for-jobs-/7962503.html	2025-02-04T08:05:10-08:00	
Syria's Sharaa aims to restore US ties, no contacts yet with Trump administration	Beirut, Lebanon — Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said his government aims to restore ties with the United States in the coming days but has not yet had any contact with the Trump administration, according to an interview with The Economist. Sharaa, declared Syria's interim head of state last week, also noted that U.S. troops were in Syria without government approval, adding that any such presence should be agreed with the state. He described U.S. sanctions still imposed on Syria as 'the gravest risk' to the country. 'I believe that President [Donald] Trump seeks peace in the area, and it is a top priority to lift the sanctions. The United States of America does not have any interest in maintaining the suffering of the Syrian people,' Sharaa said in the interview published late on Monday. Sharaa led the Islamist armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaida affiliate, in the lightning offensive that toppled former President Bashar al-Assad on December 8. Syria has been under tough sanctions for years, imposed by the United States and other Western powers to isolate Assad over his brutal crackdown and to generate pressure for a political solution after more than a decade of civil war. In January, the outgoing Biden administration issued a sanctions exemption for transactions with Syrian governing institutions for six months. It followed a visit to Damascus by senior U.S. diplomats in December. The United States, however, continues to designate HTS as a terrorist entity, even though it severed ties with al-Qaida in 2016. The U.S. embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in 2012. Terrorist designation 'meaningless' Sharaa said HTS's terrorist designation had 'become meaningless' following a decision to dissolve all the armed factions that fought Assad. The United States deployed forces to Syria a decade ago during the campaign against Islamic State. They still have a presence in the north and northeast backing a Syrian ally, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 'In light of the new Syrian state, I believe any illegal military presence should not continue. Any military presence in a sovereign state should take place under a certain agreement, and there has been no such agreement between us and the United States of America,' Sharaa said. He also said his administration was 'reassessing the Russian military presence' in Syria, where Moscow propped up Assad. Russia, seeking to retain both a naval and air base in Syria, sent a senior official to Damascus last week. 'We might reach an agreement [with them] or not, but in one way or another, any military presence should be with the agreement of the host state,' Sharaa said. Asked whether he could imagine normalizing ties with Israel, Sharaa said 'we want peace with all parties' but it was a sensitive issue because of regional wars and Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in a 1967 war. 'There are many priorities in front of us, so it is too early to discuss such a matter because it requires wide public opinion. It also requires a lot of procedures and laws in order to discuss it, and to be honest, we have not considered it yet.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-sharaa-aims-to-restore-us-ties-no-contacts-yet-with-trump-administration/7962500.html	2025-02-04T08:00:11-08:00

Senate committee advances Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nomination to be health secretary	Washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial environmental lawyer turned public health critic, cleared his first hurdle on Tuesday to become the nation's top health official when the senate finance committee voted to advance his nomination for a floor vote. Republicans voted together to advance his nomination, while Democrats all opposed. His nomination now will face a full senate vote, despite concerns about the work he's done to sow doubts around vaccine safety and his potential to profit off lawsuits over drugmakers. To gain control of the $1.7 trillion Health and Human Services agency, Kennedy will need support from all but three Republicans if Democrats uniformly oppose him. Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who is also a physician and sits on the finance committee, voted to advance Kennedy's confirmation. Last week, during Kennedy's hearings, Cassidy repeatedly implored Kennedy to reject a disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, to no avail. He ended the hearing by saying he was 'struggling' with the vote. 'Your past, undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments, concerns me,' Cassidy told Kennedy. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are all seen as potential no votes, too, because they voted against President Donald Trump's defense secretary nominee and have expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. In a CBS '60 Minutes' interview that aired Sunday, McConnell declined to say how he would vote on Kennedy's nomination but reiterated 'vaccines are critically important.' Democrats, meanwhile, continue to raise alarms about Kennedy's potential to financially benefit from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers if confirmed as health secretary. 'It seems possible that many different types of vaccine-related decisions and communications — which you would be empowered to make and influence as Secretary — could result in significant financial compensation for your family,' Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote in a letter sent over the weekend to Kennedy. Kennedy said he'll give his son all of the referral fees in legal cases against vaccine makers, including the fees he gets from referring clients in a case against Merck. Kennedy told the committee he's referred hundreds of clients to a law firm that's suing Merck's Gardasil, the human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. He's earned $2.5 million from the deal over the past three years. As secretary, Kennedy will oversee vaccine recommendations and public health campaigns for the $1.7 trillion agency, which is also responsible for food and hospital inspections, providing health insurance for millions of Americans and researching deadly diseases. Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, ran for president but withdrew last year to throw his support to Trump in exchange for an influential job in his Republican administration. Together, they have forged a new and unusual coalition made up of conservatives who oppose vaccines and liberals who want to see the government promote healthier foods. Trump and Kennedy have branded the movement as 'Make America Healthy Again.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-committee-advances-robert-f-kennedy-jr-nomination-to-be-health-secretary-/7962491.html	2025-02-04T07:48:50-08:00	
Thai Prime Minister heads to China amid growing global uncertainties	Taipei, Taiwan — Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra kicks off a four-day trip to China on Wednesday that is expected to focus on economic and trade ties. During the visit, which will include a meeting with China’s leader Xi Jinping, analysts say the prime minister will also seek Beijing’s help in boosting Chinese tourists’ confidence in traveling to Thailand. Paetongtarn's trip comes amid growing concerns among Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to Thailand. In January a television actor from China, Wang Xing, was abducted from the Southeast Asian country and forced to work in a scam center in neighboring Myanmar. 'China is pretty concerned about what’s going on in Thailand, especially the cyber scam centers, so the Thai Prime Minister’s visit is to assure the Chinese that the Thais are doing whatever they can to deal with the scam center [issue],' said Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia program. In recent weeks, Thai and Chinese law enforcement joined forces publicly to crack down on the dozens of cyber scam operations dotting the Chinese-Thai-and-Myanmar border, including the arrest of a man suspected of involvement in the abduction of the Chinese artist Wang Xing. Chinese and Thai officials agreed to further enhance cooperation in the fight against the cyber scam gangs, including setting up a coordination center in Bangkok. 'Thai Prime Minister may allow Chinese police freer rein to operate in Thailand, including working more formally with Thai police and establishing Chinese police stations in Thailand,' Paul Chambers, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand, told VOA in a written response. During the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign tourism to Thailand plunged, pummeling the economy. Numbers have started to recover and some 35 million visited the country in 2024, with more than 6.2 million from China. The recent abduction case, however, has presented a new challenge. 'Bringing back tourism is so important for Thailand, and they need the Chinese government’s support due to Beijing’s control over the media,' said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, who focuses on Southeast Asia politics. While the cyber scam centers have posed challenges to Thailand and China, some analysts say this issue won’t fundamentally change relations between the two countries. 'Some recent cooperation on this front [between China and Thailand] signals that both countries are going to be pragmatic about this and not let the overall concerns rock the official relationship,' Hunter Marston, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia, told VOA by phone. Improving economic ties In addition to tackling illegal cyber scam operations, experts say the Thai prime minister also will seek to strengthen bilateral cooperation in areas such as infrastructure development with China during her trip. 'Thailand may offer China some new choices for infrastructure projects,' Paul Chambers in Thailand said. One project that is likely to be high on the agenda is the 609-kilometer-long high-speed rail project that Thailand hopes to finish building by 2030. The railway, when complete, will connect Thailand with southern China by traveling through neighboring Laos. 'The high-speed rail will be the priority for Thailand when it comes to their engagement with China, and China sees this project as beneficial to their regional vision for connectivity in the long run,' Marston said. Despite the mutual interest in deepening collaboration over infrastructure projects, Thailand also faces challenges posed by the influx of cheap Chinese goods. Last year, the Thai government set up a task force made up of 28 agencies to review and revise regulations to curb the threats to Thai businesses posed by cheap Chinese imports. While these challenges remain serious, Yaacob at Lowy Institute in Australia said Bangkok is likely to focus on more than just trade concerns. 'The Thai government will be keen to look at what areas they can work with the Chinese, such as attracting Chinese investments that could create jobs for the Thai people,' he told VOA in a video interview through Zoom. Hedging between U.S. and China Ahead of Paetongtarn’s trip to China, rights groups and countries around the world, including the U.S., have called on Thailand not to deport 48 Uyghur detainees back to China. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had suggested that he would use diplomacy and the 'longstanding U.S.-Thailand alliance to keep that from happening. Marston says the Thai government may comply with Beijing’s demands. 'Thailand might use China’s request for the deportation of Uyghurs to ask for some deliverables from China, such as receiving Chinese support to become an advanced economy or to dominate certain sectors,' he told VOA. Yaacob believes Thailand is likely to continue its longstanding foreign policy stance of hedging between Beijing and Washington. However, he adds that if the Trump administration comes down hard on Southeast Asia in terms of trade policies, it could give Beijing more room to seek closer ties with Bangkok. 'Southeast Asian countries rely on trade, so if they are affected [by the Trump administration’s policies], they may look at China as an alternative,' Yaacob told VOA. In his view, security is an area where Beijing may seek to reduce Washington’s influence in Southeast Asia. 'The U.S. has played a major security role in Southeast Asia and China is quite interested in reducing American influence in that domain since they view Southeast Asia as their backyard,' Yaacob said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-prime-minister-heads-to-china-amid-growing-global-uncertainties/7962476.html	2025-02-04T07:40:00-08:00	
5 shot at adult education center in Sweden	OREBRO, SWEDEN — Five people were shot at an adult education center in Sweden on Tuesday, police said. The conditions of the victims weren't immediately clear. The Swedish news agency TT reported, without providing its sources, that the perpetrator died by suicide. Police didn't immediately confirm that reporting. The adult education center is on the outskirts of the city of Orebro, which is located about 200 kilometers west of Stockholm. The school, called Campus Risbergska, serves students who are over age 20, according to its website. Primary and upper secondary school courses are offered, as well as Swedish classes for immigrants, vocational training and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. Teacher Lena Warenmark told SVT News that there were unusually few students on the campus Tuesday afternoon because many went home after a national test. She also told the broadcaster that she heard probably 10 gunshots. Video from the scene showed a large police presence and other emergency vehicles. Students were sheltering in nearby buildings. Other parts of the school were evacuated following the shooting, which began around 12:30 p.m. Andreas Sundling, 28, was among those forced to barricade themselves inside the school. 'We heard three bangs and loud screams,' he told Expressen newspaper while sheltering in a classroom. 'Now we're sitting here waiting to be evacuated from the school. The information we have received is that we should sit and wait.' It wasn't immediately clear whether police were counting the perpetrator among the five shot. Police said that no officers were shot during the violence. 'The reports of violence in Orebro are very serious. The police are on site and the operation is in full swing,' Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told TT. During a news conference on the Swedish employment market, another government official addressed the violence in Orebro, which has a population of around 155,000. 'The government is following developments very closely and has a continuous dialogue with the police about this,' Mats Persson, minister for employment and integration, said Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shot-at-adult-education-center-in-sweden/7962399.html	2025-02-04T07:08:28-08:00	
Taliban threaten to use US arms to thwart attempts to retake them	ISLAMABAD — The Taliban have warned that the military weapons left behind by the United States in Afghanistan now belong to them as 'spoils of war' and will be utilized to defend against any attempts to reclaim them. The statement marks the first official response from the internationally unrecognized government in Kabul to President Donald Trump’s pledge on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve U.S. arms from the de facto Islamist Afghan leaders. 'The weapons that America abandoned in Afghanistan, as well as those provided to the former Afghan regime, are now in the possession of the Mujahideen [or Taliban forces] as spoils of war,' claimed Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, while participating in an X space session late on Monday. 'The Afghan people now own these weapons and are utilizing them to defend their independence, sovereignty, and Islamic system. No external force can compel us to surrender these weapons, nor will we accept any demands for their surrender,' Mujahid stated. 'We will use these weapons to repel invaders who dare to seize them.' U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan for nearly two decades to counter terrorist groups and protect the internationally backed government in Kabul at the time. They hastily and chaotically withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban stormed back to power. A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7 billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban. Trump stated in his pre-inauguration remarks at a rally in Washington last month that his predecessor, Joe Biden, 'gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.' He went on to warn that future financial assistance to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan would be contingent upon the return of U.S. military arms. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment,' Trump said then, without elaborating. Mujahid, while speaking on Monday, rejected Trump’s assertions, saying the Taliban have not received 'a single penny' from the U.S. in financial aid since regaining control of the country. He stated that Kabul has neither anticipated nor sought any assistance from Washington. The Taliban have displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations since returning to power in Afghanistan. The U.S. troop exit from Afghanistan stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-threaten-to-use-us-arms-to-thwart-attempts-to-retake-them-/7962251.html	2025-02-04T04:37:57-08:00	
Israeli military troops killed gunman in West Bank	Israel’s military said Tuesday its forces killed a gunman in the occupied West Bank who had fired at soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces said the exchange of gunfire took place at a checkpoint in the village of Tayasir. Israeli emergency services said at least six people were injured, including two soldiers. In recent weeks the Israeli military has been conducting an operation in the area, particularly around Jenin, that it says it aimed at thwarting terrorism. The military said Sunday it had killed at least 50 militants since launching the operation two weeks ago, while Palestinian health officials said Israeli forces have killed 70 people in the West Bank since the start of the year. Violence in the West Bank surged following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli counteroffensive against the U.S.-designated terror group in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 800 Palestinians during that time, while Israel says Palestinian attacks have killed at least 30 Israelis. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-troops-killed-gunman-in-west-bank-/7962166.html	2025-02-04T03:26:05-08:00	
Thailand to cut power to Myanmar border areas linked to scam centers	BANGKOK — Thailand will suspend electricity supply to some border areas with Myanmar in an effort to curb scam centres, its government said on Tuesday, amid growing pressure on the illegal compounds that have ensnared vast numbers of people of multiple nationalities. According to the United Nations, hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked by criminal gangs and forced to work in scam centers and illegal online operations across Southeast Asia, including along the Thai-Myanmar border. A 2023 U.N. report estimated the fast-growing operations generate billions of dollars annually. 'We must take action to cut off the electricity immediately,' Thai Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters, adding authorities would instruct the Provincial Electricity Authority that supplies power to these areas to cut it off. The scam compounds have come into renewed focus after Chinese actor Wang Xing was abducted after arriving in Thailand last month. He was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. Thailand has been concerned about the impact on its vital tourism sector and has sought to allay safety concerns of visitors from China, a key source market. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said talks would be held on Tuesday with the National Security Council on various measures to address the scam compounds, including stopping the power supply. 'What happened has had a huge impact on many Thai people and the image of the country,' she said. Asked when power would be cut off, she said: 'Today, if we talk and it's clear, then we can do it today.' The security council's chief on Monday said evidence showed transnational crime syndicates operating in Myanmar's Tachileik, Myawaddy, and Payathonzu - outlining areas that the power supply cuts may target. Myanmar's state-run Global New Light of Myanmar, in a rare article on scam centers last month, said basic essentials, including power and internet, are not provided by Myanmar but by other countries, in a veiled reference to Thailand. It said 'foreign organizations' were investing in this infrastructure. Myanmar's military government has since October 2023 repatriated more than 55,000 foreigners, overwhelmingly Chinese, who were forced to work in scam compounds to their home countries, the newspaper said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-to-cut-power-to-myanmar-border-areas-linked-to-scam-centers/7962150.html	2025-02-04T02:49:44-08:00	
Ukraine says Russian drone attacks damaged buildings	Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks overnight damaged houses and other buildings in multiple regions. Ukraine’s military said its air defenses shot down 37 of the 65 drones that Russian forces launched in the attacks, with intercepts taking place in the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Poltava and Sumy regions. The Sumy Regional Military Administration said the attacks damaged eight houses and a school in the region. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from destroyed drones caused fires at three businesses. In Kyiv, officials said falling drone debris damaged several schools and a clinic. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday its air defenses destroyed a Ukrainian guided missile over the Sea of Azov. Rare earth minerals U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday he possibly would be interested in continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. 'We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,' Trump told reporters at the White House. Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine include lithium and titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech products. In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing attacks. He said Russia is 'focusing primarily' on Ukraine’s energy sector. 'They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,' Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. 'There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,' the president said and urged Ukraine to 'be much faster' in adjusting to the continuous changes. The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies of the systems for Ukraine are 'critical and must not stop.' 'We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense, increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,' the president said. 'This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s future depends on it.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-drone-attacks-damaged-buildings/7962120.html	2025-02-04T01:24:17-08:00	
Philippines, U.S. hold joint air patrol over South China Sea, angering China	The air forces of the Philippines and the United States held joint patrols over the South China Sea on Tuesday, a move that angered China, which also conducted a 'routine patrol' over a disputed shoal. The Philippines and the United States have ramped up security arrangements under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. against a backdrop of rising tension between Manila and Beijing stemming from overlapping claims in the busy waterway. The one-day exercise by the treaty allies took place in the West Philippine Sea, Philippine air force spokesperson Maria Consuelo Castillo said, using Manila's term for waters in the South China Sea that fall within its exclusive economic zone. 'The exercise aimed to enhance operational coordination, improve air domain awareness, and reinforce agile combat employment capabilities between the two air forces,' Castillo said in a statement. Castillo said three Philippine FA-50 fighter aircraft and two U.S. B1-B bombers participated in the exercise, which included flying over Scarborough Shoal, where the Chinese air force also carried out what it called a routine patrol. In a statement on Tuesday, China's military accused the Philippines of joining patrols it said were organized by foreign countries to 'undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea.' China's air force units would maintain a 'high degree of alert, resolutely defend China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and control any military activities that disrupt the South China Sea,' the Southern Theatre Command added. China claims almost all the strategic waterway, a conduit for $3 trillion in annual commerce, despite overlapping claims by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. At a briefing on Tuesday, the Philippine navy said it was 'closely monitoring' three Chinese navy vessels within Manila's maritime zones, including a Jiangkai-class guided missile frigate. 'The presence of People's Liberation Army-Navy reflects the People's Republic of China's complete disregard for international law and undermines the peace and stability in the region,' said navy spokesperson John Percie Alcos. On Monday, state news agency Xinhua said the passage of the Chinese fleet was consistent with international law, quoting a spokesperson of the PLA's Southern Theater Command. An international arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, but Beijing does not recognize the decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-u-s-hold-joint-air-patrol-over-south-china-sea-angering-china/7962117.html	2025-02-04T01:11:58-08:00	
VOA Uzbek: Russian-Ukraine war fuels resurgence of the new Silk Road	After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing Western sanctions, landlocked Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan are trying to find alternative trade routes to access seaports and the world market. Uzbekistan intends to connect to the Europe-Caucasus-Asia transport corridor. However, the aspiration of economically linking the Caucasus and Central Asia could eventually evolve into an interregional political and security dialogue.

EU leaders agree to step up defense efforts	BRUSSELS — European Union leaders agreed Monday to do more to bolster their defenses against Russia and other threats by hiking spending and filling gaps in their military capabilities. 'A lot has been done already but we need to do more. We need to do it better, stronger, faster - and we need to do it together,' Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, said after a one-day summit on defense in Brussels. However, the leaders left largely unanswered the question of how their planned surge in defense spending would be paid for. European countries have already ramped up defense spending in recent years, in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and a growing view that they cannot rely so much on the United States to protect the continent in years to come. Their efforts have been fueled by questions about U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to the NATO security alliance and by his demands for European nations to spend more on the continent's defenses. The start of the EU summit was overshadowed by Trump declaring at the weekend that he will soon impose tariffs on imports from the EU, having ordered similar measures on goods from Canada and Mexico - which were paused on Monday - and from China. The EU leaders agreed to focus on filling critical gaps in their defenses such as air and missile defense, missiles, ammunition and military transport, Costa told reporters. The leaders discussed how such priorities could be funded but did not reach a detailed agreement. The European Commission, however, agreed to look for flexibility in rules it oversees on EU countries' public finances to make defense spending easier. 'Europe needs, basically, a surge in defense. And for that, our defense industrial base must be strengthened,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after the summit. 'For many, many years, we have under-invested in defense. Thus, there's a great urgency to increase the defense spending with a big magnitude,' she said. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also took part in the Brussels talks. Spending hike Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense, or about $334.5 billion - a 30% increase on 2021, according to EU estimates. But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. The Commission, the EU's executive body, has estimated the bloc may need to spend an extra $510 billion over the next decade to fill the critical gaps in European defenses. Trump has said NATO's European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense - a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches. Von der Leyen and Costa said the EU had several potential defense-financing options, including national spending, an expanded role for the EU's European Investment Bank and private capital. Leaders avoided directly addressing in public the politically sensitive question of whether the EU should issue joint debt to pay for defense spending. Diplomats say borrowing to finance loans rather than grants for military projects may be a possible compromise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-agree-to-step-up-defense-efforts/7962096.html	2025-02-04T00:32:55-08:00	
A Russia-like crackdown has jailed dozens in Georgia	Tbilisi, Georgia — Jailed journalist Mzia Amaghlobeli gets weaker every day as her hunger strike has reached three weeks in Rustavi, a town near the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, her lawyer says. Now the 49-year-old is having difficulty walking the short distance from her cell to the room where they usually meet, and human rights officials, colleagues and family fear for her life. Amaghlobeli was arrested Jan. 12 during an anti-government protest in the coastal city of Batumi, one of over 40 people in custody on criminal charges from a series of demonstrations that have hit the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million in recent months. The political turmoil follows a parliamentary election that was won by the ruling Georgian Dream party, although its opponents allege the vote was rigged. Its outcome pushed Georgia further into Russia's orbit of influence. Georgia aspired to join the European Union, but the party suspended accession talks with the bloc after the election. As it sought to cement its grip on power, Georgian Dream has cracked down on freedom of assembly and expression in what the opposition says is similar to President Vladimir Putin's actions in neighboring Russia, its former imperial ruler. Accusations of fomenting revolution Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze defended the actions of his government, accusing the protesters of seeking 'to inflict harm on the state' and trying to stage a revolution akin to the uprising in Ukraine in 2014 that ousted a pro-Kremlin leader. Georgian Dream last year adopted a series of laws similar to ones in Russia imposing restrictions on rights groups and media outlets and severely curtailing LGBTQ+ rights. Those laws, condemned by the EU, also drew protests. Amaghlobeli, founder of two prominent independent media outlets in Georgia, faces charges of assaulting a police officer, with a possible prison sentence of up to seven years. Many of those detained by police have reported being abused physically and verbally by police or while in detention. International human rights groups are sounding the alarm. 'All of that paints a picture of an aggressive campaign to halt these demonstrations of which the large majority are reported to have been peaceful,' Alice Jill Edwards, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, told The Associated Press. Allegations of abuse in custody A video released by the media showed Amaghlobeli slapping Batumi's police chief in the protest. Witnesses and her lawyers say police physically and verbally abused her beforehand, and the slap was her reaction to it. The abuse continued while in custody, when the police chief 'spat in Mzia’s face and denied her access to drinking water or using the toilet,' her lawyer, Juba Sikharulidze, told AP. Authorities were investigating the accusations, the lawyer said. The Interior Ministry has not responded to an AP request for comment. Kobakhidze has said authorities would investigate any excessive use of force, but in Amaghlobeli’s case, her actions came 'in front of cameras.' 'This crime is absolutely clear,' the prime minister said. Amaghlobeli, who founded the independent media sites Batumelebi and Netgazeti, began a hunger strike in protest, and now Georgian and Western rights advocates say her life is in danger. Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Amaghlobeli’s situation 'requires urgent action.' 'This is not just a matter of freedom and imprisonment – this is a matter of life and death. And I very much hope that the authorities will act with the necessary speed in this extremely difficult situation,' O’Flaherty was quoted by the outlet as saying. Amaghlobeli's arrest has had a chilling effect on other journalists, said Nestan Tsetskhladze, editor of Netgazeti. 'If this is how they are treating the founder of the most prominent independent media, a director and media manager who is free from any political influences and influential groups, others can be treated the same way or even worse,' Tsetskhladze told AP. Prominent actor sees a Kafkaesque scene Another prominent Georgian jailed for taking part in protests is Andro Chichinadze, a theater and film actor. Chichinazde, 28, actively participated in the protests that reignited in November. Police raided his home and arrested him Dec. 5, and he faces charges of 'participating in group violence,' punishable by up to nine years in prison. His lawyers say prosecutors have videos of Chichinadze swinging a stick and throwing a bottle, which they allege was hurled at him by police. They also say there is no evidence he hit anyone and no one has come forward as a victim of his alleged violence. Chichinadze denied the accusations. At a pre-trial detention hearing, he compared himself to a 'Kafka character who is on trial and could not figure out what is happening to him.' His mother, Lika Guntsadze, called the case against her son 'absurd, just absurd' in an interview with AP. Plans for harsher penalties More arrests — so far on petty 'administrative' charges punishable by fines or short stints in jail — took place over the weekend, during continued demonstrations in Tbilisi. On Monday, police said a total of 31 people had been detained. According to media reports, some were released shortly afterward. Many reported physical abuse by police both during their arrest and after being taken into police vans, according to the office of Georgia's Public Defender, a human rights ombudsman elected by parliament. Georgian Dream announced plans Monday to adopt harsher punishment for both criminal and administrative offenses that protesters can be accused of, including increased jail time, higher fines and prison terms. Eka Gigauri, executive director of Transparency International Georgia, told AP she believed the government was 'using the Russian and Belarusian playbook' in targeting government opponents. 'There is nothing new in how they attack the civic activists,' she said. 'This was happening in Russia years ago.' The mother of Andro Chichinadze, the actor who was arrested, echoed this sentiment, in describing the crackdown that followed Georgia's aspirations to join the EU. 'We chose Europe and were taken to Russia,' Lika Guntsadze said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-russia-like-crackdown-has-jailed-dozens-in-georgia/7962094.html	2025-02-04T00:30:10-08:00	
France pitches AI summit as 'wake-up call' for Europe	PARIS — France hosts top tech players next week at an artificial intelligence summit meant as a 'wake-up call' for Europe as it struggles with AI challenges from the United States and China. Players from across the sector and representatives from 80 nations will gather in the French capital on February 10 and 11 in the sumptuous Grand Palais, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition. In the run-up, President Emmanuel Macron will on Feb. 4 visit research centers applying AI to science and health, before hosting scientists and Nobel Prize winners at his Elysee Palace residence on Wednesday. A wider science conference will be held at the Polytechnique engineering school on Thursday and Friday. 'The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position' to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron's office told reporters. In recent weeks, Washington's announcement of $500 billion in investment to build up AI infrastructure and the release of a frugal but powerful generative AI model by Chinese firm DeepSeek have focused minds in Europe. France must 'not let this revolution pass it by,' Macron's office said. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI -- the firm that brought generative models to public consciousness in 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT. Google boss Sundar Pichai and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company's DeepMind AI research unit, will also come, alongside Arthur Mensch, founder of French AI developer Mistral. The Elysee has said there are 'talks' on hosting DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, and has yet to clarify whether X owner Elon Musk -- who has his own generative initiative, xAI -- has accepted an invitation. Nor is it clear who will attend from the United States and China, with the French presidency saying only 'very high level' representatives will come. Confirmed guests from Europe include European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. 'Stoke confidence' The tone of the AI summit will be 'neither catastrophizing, nor naive,' Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told AFP. Hosting the conference is also an opportunity for Paris to show off its own AI ecosystem, which numbers around 750 companies. Macron's office has said the summit would see the announcement of 'massive' investments along the lines of his annual 'Choose France' business conference, at which $15.4 billion of inward investment were pledged in 2024. Beyond the economic opportunities, AI's impact on culture including artistic creativity and news production will be discussed in a side-event over the weekend. Debates open to the public, such as that one, are aimed at showing off 'positive use cases for AI' to 'stoke confidence and speed up adoption' of the technology, said France's digital minister Clara Chappaz. For now, the French public is skeptical of AI, with 79 percent of respondents telling pollsters Ifop they were 'concerned' about the technology in a recent survey. More 'inclusive' AI? Paris says it also hopes the summit can help kick off its vision of a more ethical and accessible and less resource-intensive AI. At present, 'the AI under development is pushed by a few large players from a few countries,' Bouverot said, whereas France wants 'to promote more inclusive development.' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to co-host the Paris summit, in a push to bring governments on board. One of the summit's aims is the establishment of a public-interest foundation for which Paris aims to raise $2.5 billion over five years. The effort would be 'a public-private partnership between various governments, businesses and philanthropic foundations from different countries,' Macron's office said. Paris hopes at the summit to chart different efforts at AI governance around the world and gather commitments for environmentally sustainable AI -- although no binding mechanism is planned for now. 'There are lots of big principles emerging around responsible, trustworthy AI, but it's not clear or easy to implement for the engineers in technical terms,' said Laure de Roucy-Rochegonde, director of the geopolitical technology center at the French Institute for International Relations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-pitches-ai-summit-as-wake-up-call-for-europe/7962090.html	2025-02-04T00:19:33-08:00	
Rice stockpile eyed as Japan PM orders swift relief from rising prices	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ordered the swift implementation of measures to give consumers relief from inflated food prices, including an unprecedented release of stockpiled rice to bring down costs, a minister said on Tuesday. At a news conference, Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa said Ishiba had instructed the cabinet to proceed quickly with countermeasures as the prices of rice, vegetables and other living costs have soared in recent months. 'Citizens are suffering greatly and feeling pain,' he said, noting that the elevated price of rice had been unexpected. The average transaction price of rice produced last year jumped 55% to $153 per 60 kg, from the previous year, according to government data. The agriculture ministry last week agreed on a new policy that would allow the government to sell stockpiled rice to farm cooperatives on the condition that the buyers would sell back the equivalent amount to the government within a year. It would be the first time stockpiled rice has been released to bring down prices. Details such as the sale price and timing are yet to be decided, a ministry official said on Tuesday. Japanese consumer prices rose 3.6% in December from the previous year, marking the biggest jump in almost two years, while the share of households' spending on food hit a four-decade high last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rice-stockpile-eyed-as-japan-pm-orders-swift-relief-from-rising-prices/7962066.html	2025-02-03T22:36:10-08:00	
Trump hosting Netanyahu for White House talks amid Gaza ceasefire	U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for talks Tuesday at the White House with Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip at the top of the agenda. The talks come at a key phase in the ceasefire. Israel and Hamas have less than four weeks to agree on the terms of the second phase, which would include the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza, a permanent halt in fighting and Israel’s withdrawal from the territory. 'I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold,' Trump told reporters Monday. Ahead of the White House visit, Netanyahu met Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was part of the push to secure the ceasefire deal. Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the meeting was 'positive and friendly,' and that he would meet with his Security Cabinet upon returning from the U.S. in order to 'discus Israel’s overall positions regarding the second stage of the deal.' Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian officials as the three countries continue in their role of mediating the halt in fighting. In addition to the ceasefire, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, has released 18 hostages so far, while Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-hosting-netanyahu-for-white-house-talks-amid-gaza-ceasefire/7962063.html	2025-02-03T22:26:39-08:00	
S. Korea wants to rebuild air safety system after crash, fire	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea aims to rebuild its aviation safety system from scratch, the transport ministry said on Tuesday, launching a new committee to improve air travel in the country that suffered two major aviation incidents a month apart. 'In order to restore trust in our country's aviation safety system, the government will make a determined effort to rebuild the aviation safety system from the ground up,' Deputy Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Baek Won-kuk will tell the committee, the ministry statement said. The government must address aviation safety as a top priority, he added. In the deadliest air disaster ever on South Korean soil, a plane belonging to budget airline Jeju Air crashed at the country's Muan airport on Dec. 29, killing all but two of the 181 passengers and crew members on board. Duck remains were found in both engines of the plane, a preliminary investigation report said, indicating bird strikes occurred before the crash. Air accidents are nearly always caused by a combination of factors, according to experts. Last week, an Air Busan plane was engulfed in flames at Busan's international airport as the low-cost carrier's jet prepared to depart, with all on board evacuated safely. The fire was first detected by a flight attendant in an overhead luggage bin in the rear of the plane, Air Busan has said. Investigations into the causes of both incidents are ongoing. The 10-week committee will include private sector experts and will look at issues including maintenance and aircraft utilization rates at budget airlines, and airport construction and operation. In response to the Jeju Air crash, which saw the plane belly land but then plow into a concrete embankment supporting navigation equipment past the end of Muan's runway, authorities already said they would amend similar structures at seven airports around the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/s-korea-wants-to-rebuild-air-safety-system-after-crash-fire-/7962057.html	2025-02-03T21:53:43-08:00	
US tariffs on Chinese goods go into effect	New U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect Tuesday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump backed off plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. The new 10% duty that Trump announced Saturday is a first step in pressuring China, the president said Monday. China has said it would take countermeasures in response to the tariff, including action at the World Trade Organization. Trump pledged to impose the tariff to push China to take action to prevent fentanyl smuggling into the United States. The U.S. government has identified China as a major source of the precursor chemicals used by Mexican drug cartels to manufacture fentanyl. China has said it has taken steps to crack down on the industry and illicit drug trade. 'China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher,' Trump said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days. Trump on Monday announced a one-month pause for the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods after he spoke with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Sheinbaum said she would dispatch 10,000 National Guard troops to try to curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States. 'Mexico will reinforce the northern border … to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,' Sheinbaum posted on X after talking with Trump. 'The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.' The Mexican leader added that the two countries would continue talks on security and trade and that 'the tariffs are put on pause for a month from now.' Trudeau said Canada would deploy new technology and personnel along its border with the United States to stop the flow of fentanyl. 'I just had a good call with President Trump,' Trudeau said on X. 'Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.' Both Sheinbaum and Trudeau, representing two of the three biggest U.S. trading partners along with China, protested Trump’s tariff plans and vowed to retaliate. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown over tariffs as a trade war, despite the planned retaliations from Mexico, Canada and China and the risk of escalation. 'Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,' Hassett said. 'This is a drug war.' Trump acknowledged Sunday that the new tariffs on the three biggest U.S. trading partners could hit inflation-weary Americans with higher prices for groceries, gasoline, cars and other consumer goods, but said the higher tariffs would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. U.S. consumers could face higher prices because companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers, rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. Tensions ramped up Monday with the leader of Canada's most populous province of Ontario announcing that he is ending a contract with Elon Musk's Starlink internet services in response to Trump's new tariff on Canada. Musk, possibly the world’s richest man, is a key Trump adviser seeking to sharply cut U.S. government spending and trim the ranks of 2.3 million federal civilian workforce through buyouts. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $68 million deal with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.

Rwanda-backed rebels in DRC declare a unilateral ceasefire	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The Rwanda-backed rebels who seized eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s key city of Goma announced a unilateral ceasefire in the region Monday for humanitarian reasons, following calls for a safe corridor for aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The M23 rebels said the ceasefire would start Tuesday. The announcement came shortly after the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people were killed in last week’s fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces. The city of 2 million people is at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth and remains in rebel control. The M23 were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu. But the rebels said Monday they did not intend to seize Bukavu, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo's capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away. 'It must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas. However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,' M23 rebel spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Congo's government. The rebels' announcement came ahead of a joint summit this week by the regional blocs for southern and eastern Africa, which have called for a ceasefire. Kenya’s President William Ruto said the presidents of Congo and Rwanda would attend. Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven advanced economies, or G7, urged parties in the conflict to return to negotiations. In a statement on Monday, they called for a 'rapid, safe and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians.' Congolese authorities have said they are open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that such a dialogue must be done within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused the Congo government of defaulting on previous agreements. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. The latest fighting forced hundreds of thousands of people who had been displaced by years of conflict to carry what remained of their belongings and flee again. Thousands poured into nearby Rwanda. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decades-long ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda said the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges. On Monday, families desperate to identify their loved ones besieged morgues as body bags were loaded onto trucks for burials in Goma. A weeping Chiza Nyenyezi recalled how her son died from a gunshot injury after a bullet went through his chest. 'His entire chest was open,' Nyenyezi said. Louise Shalukoma said her son’s body could not be immediately recovered from the streets because a bomb detonated as people tried to retrieve it. 'My God, my fourth child, when I saw that he was dead I said, ‘Lord, what am I going to do?’' she lamented. 'This M23 war came for me in Goma.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-drc-declare-a-unilateral-ceasefire-/7962050.html	2025-02-03T20:52:18-08:00	
US, El Salvador reach 'unprecedented' deal to curb illegal immigration	STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States and El Salvador have reached what U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called 'the most unprecedented and extraordinary' deal to further curb illegal immigration. After about three hours of meetings with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at his residence in Lake Coatepeque, San Salvador, Rubio said that Bukele has offered to house dangerous American criminals in Salvadoran jails, including U.S. citizens and legal residents. Bukele has also 'agreed to accept for deportation any illegal aliens in the United States' who are criminals, regardless of nationality, in addition to fully cooperating on the repatriation of Salvadorans who are in the United States illegally, Rubio told reporters. Rubio visited El Salvador on Monday to address illegal migration and other strategic issues. The State Department said Rubio also raised strategies to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere to safeguard the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the region. His visit comes amid the restructuring of a U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid, which has sparked a showdown between congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s administration. Rubio announced that he is now the acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development but has delegated his authority to another official. He stressed that the agency must align U.S. foreign aid with national interests and comply with State Department policy directives. Late Monday, the United States and El Salvador also signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, on civil nuclear cooperation, expanding strategic relations between the two nations. The State Department said the MOU marks an initial step toward building a robust civil nuclear partnership, aiming to enhance energy security and foster economic cooperation. Curtailing illegal immigration Bukele is regarded as a key ally of the United States in its regional efforts to address the migration crisis. On Oct. 7, 2024, the United States and El Salvador signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement, further strengthening border security and facilitating trade between the two countries. El Salvador was once the third-largest source of nationals captured at the U.S. southwest border. Today, it no longer ranks among the top 10. Chinese influence U.S. President Trump has maintained warm relations with Salvadoran President Bukele, who also strengthened ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping following his state visit to Beijing in December 2019. During Bukele’s visit, China promised millions in development projects for the Central American country through a series of agreements. Among them were a soccer stadium, a national library, a tourist pier, and funding for water treatment improvements. In April 2024, China and El Salvador began negotiations on a free trade agreement, though the United States remains El Salvador’s primary trading partner. El Salvador formally recognized the People's Republic of China on Aug. 21, 2018, severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Panama Earlier Monday, Rubio observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama, returning dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. A total of 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records. The top U.S. diplomat said it sent 'a clear message' that people who sought to enter the U.S. border irregularly would be stopped and sent back to their countries of origin. On July 1, 2024, the first day of Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino’s term, the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darién region en route to the United States. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security. Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 'This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,' Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 'This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,' he added. 'We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.' Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darién region compared to the same period last year. Canal controversy On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will 'take necessary measures' if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's 'influence and control' over the Panama Canal. 'Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 'We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,' Mulino added on Sunday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' At the United Nations, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong dismissed the accusations against China as 'totally false' and 'pointless.' He said that China has never participated in the management or operation of the Panama Canal nor interfered in its affairs. He also reaffirmed respect for Panama’s sovereignty and the canal’s status as a neutral international gateway. The Chinese ambassador further called Panama’s decision not to renew the BRI agreement 'regrettable.' After visiting Panama and El Salvador, Rubio will travel to Costa Rica on Tuesday, followed by stops in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.

Scientists hope these tiny froglets can save their species	LONDON — It was quite the journey for such tiny froglets: traveling thousands of miles from the forests of southern Chile to London, carried and brooded inside their fathers' vocal sacs for safety. London Zoo said Monday that 33 endangered Darwin's frogs, named after scientist Charles Darwin, who discovered the species, were born in their new home as part of a rescue mission to save the species from extinction. Known populations of Darwin's frogs have suffered a 90% decline within a year since a deadly disease known as chytrid fungus arrived in 2023 in their habitat, the Parque Tantauco forests in southern Chile. The fungus has affected hundreds of amphibian species around the world. The creatures have a unique reproductive strategy: after the females lay eggs, the male frogs protect and rear the tiny tadpoles inside their distensible vocal sacs for them to develop in safety. A team of conservationists traveled to Chile's forests in October in search of healthy Darwin's frogs free of the infectious disease. They collected 52 frogs, which were then placed in climate-controlled boxes for a 11,265-kilometer ride by boat, car and plane to their new home in London. Of the group, 11 male frogs — each measuring under 3 centimeters — carried 33 tadpoles that were born at the zoo. 'We knew we were embarking on something special — the clock was ticking, and we needed to act quickly if we were going to save these frogs,' said Ben Tapley, curator of amphibians at London Zoo. He said the successful parent-rearing of the froglets was a 'powerful symbol of hope for the species.' The frogs are now kept in pairs inside dozens of glass tanks filled with moss and with temperatures that mimic their natural habitat. Keepers said the zoo will set up a breeding program for them, and any frogs they breed may later be reintroduced into the wild. Andres Valenzuela-Sanchez, a researcher at ZSL, the conservation charity behind London Zoo, said the project will ensure the species has a fighting chance of recovery. 'These frogs are not only vital for the future of their species but also help us better understand how we can combat chytrid fungus and safeguard other amphibians globally,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scientists-hope-these-tiny-froglets-can-save-their-species-/7962025.html	2025-02-03T19:23:57-08:00	
Trump suggests Ukraine’s rare minerals as condition for continued support	U.S. President Donald Trump said he would possibly be interested in continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. 'We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,' Trump said Monday in the Oval Office. Trump has indicated Ukraine is open to the possibility of an agreement of delivering rare earth minerals to the U.S. in exchange for the continuation of U.S. aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia, according to an Associated Press report. 'We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,' the U.S. president said. Rare earth minerals like those in Ukraine, include lithium and titanium. They are essential for an array of modern high-tech products. In his daily address Monday, before Trump’s announcement, Ukraine’s president reiterated the country’s need to defend itself against Russia’s ongoing attacks. He said Russia is 'focusing primarily' on Ukraine’s energy sector. 'They continue their attacks, constantly adjusting their strikes to the capabilities of our defense, making them more difficult to repel,' Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. 'There is a constant rapid evolution of electronic warfare,' the president said and urged Ukraine to 'be much faster' in adjusting to the continuous changes. The supply of air defense systems for Ukraine is another issue for the Eastern European country. Zelenskyy said that the supplies are 'critical and must not stop.' 'We must constantly search worldwide for ways to strengthen defense, increase production of necessary equipment in Ukraine, expand localization of production and obtain licenses from our partners,' the president said. 'This is a huge undertaking, and much of Ukraine’s future depends on it.' Zelenskyy also said in his daily address that he talked Monday with Ukraine’s military Commander in Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi about modernizing the country’s armed forces. As part of that discussion, the two men also talked about appointing corps commanders who 'must be the most prepared, most promising officers, with combat experience and [a] modern mindset.' While the president said, 'The army must be modern,' he also said, 'most importantly, it must value its people.' Earlier Monday, Russian officials said that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia. Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery. Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing no casualties. The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 70 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks damaged three houses and an agricultural business. Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged four residential buildings. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged a school.

Ecuador's Noboa closes borders ahead of presidential election	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has announced the closure of Ecuador's borders starting Saturday for three days, including the first round of the presidential election on Sunday in which he is a candidate. 'Faced with attempts at destabilization by armed groups, from Saturday 8 to Monday 10 February, the borders will remain closed,' the leader declared on his social media X account Monday. The 37-year-old head of state also decided to strengthen the military presence in border areas and to 'immediately militarize the ports.' On Saturday, Daniel Noboa spoke of the arrest by his security team of 12 people dressed in police and army uniforms, carrying rifles, ammunition and equipped with a drone, while he was campaigning for his reelection, speaking of 'narco-terrorists' seeking to 'destabilize' the country. Noboa, the son of a billionaire banana king, came to power in November 2023 to complete the 18-month term of his predecessor Guillermo Lasso, who had called early elections to avoid his impeachment amid corruption accusations. In January 2024, the young president declared the country in 'internal armed conflict' after the escape of a powerful drug lord from a Guayaquil prison sparked a wave of violence. In Ecuador, at least twenty gangs are dedicated to drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, sowing terror and death in this country of 17 million inhabitants. Located on the Pacific and with a dollarized economy, Ecuador — once considered a haven amid Peru and Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producers — has in recent years become a logistical hub for drug shipments. Gang conflicts have sparked unprecedented violence there. In 2023, the country recorded a record rate of 47 homicides per 100,000 people. Through states of emergency including the deployment of the army in the streets, the Noboa government claims to have reduced this homicide rate to 38 by 2024. The liberal president and his left-wing opponent, lawyer Luisa Gonzalez, are due to face off again at the polls Sunday for the first round of the presidential election in Ecuador, after a first electoral contest in October 2023 won by Noboa with 52.1% of the vote. Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza is also a candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-noboa-closes-borders-ahead-of-presidential-election-/7961641.html	2025-02-03T18:30:01-08:00

American bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically, culturally	WEST ORANGE, New Jersey — Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle — the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky — is having a moment. The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000s, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring. In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered in January, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence — and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend. How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex. Their well-being was intertwined with an insecticide The story — there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance — centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972. To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to 'incubate' while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program. 'They’re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so, I think now it’s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,' said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska. Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're 'fairly adaptable' and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey — from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south. She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town — New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans — that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it. 'Those birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,' she said. 'They're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?' The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak. A resurgence in popularity, too Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month. She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans' groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in several Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology. The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an 'umbrella species,' whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser-known wildlife. 'Americans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,' Clark said. New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a native of Philadelphia Eagles territory, took his two young sons to the NFC championship game last week, a memory he said they won't forget. 'Let's never forget that Bald Eagle was officially named America's national bird at the same time the Eagles are headed back to the Super Bowl,' he said in a text message. Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green 'Birds' cap and binoculars. 'Just the mere thrill of seeing one — a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,' he said. 'It really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.' Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: 'I don’t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if... if you’re going to be able to save the species.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-bald-eagles-are-having-a-moment-ecologically-culturally/7961976.html	2025-02-03T17:28:04-08:00	
1714 Stradivarius violin could become most expensive instrument ever auctioned	NEW YORK — A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby's in New York. The auction house is estimating the value of the 'Joachim-Ma Stradivarius' at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another Stradivarius, the 'Lady Blunt,' made in 1721 and named by Guinness World Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction. Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby’s Americas president and head of global business, said Stradivari made the violin during his 'Golden Period,' which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his craftmanship. 'So, this is the peak of his output,' Jimenez said. 'This is the best violin of this era.' Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable, and its ownership history extraordinary. It's named for two of its famed owners — violin virtuosos Joseph Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died 2009. It is believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his 'Violin Concerto in D Major' because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's. Ma acquired the violin in 1969, and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stradivarius-violin-could-become-most-expensive-instrument-ever-auctioned/7961965.html	2025-02-03T17:12:50-08:00	
Trump administration opens antisemitism inquiries at 5 colleges, including Columbia and Berkeley	The Trump administration is opening new investigations into allegations of antisemitism at five U.S. universities including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, the Education Department announced Monday. It's part of President Donald Trump's promise to take a tougher stance against campus antisemitism and deal out harsher penalties than the Biden administration, which settled a flurry of cases with universities in its final weeks. It comes the same day the Justice Department announced a new task force to root out antisemitism on college campuses. In an order signed last week, Trump called for aggressive action to fight anti-Jewish bias on campuses, including the deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests. Along with Columbia and Berkeley, the department is now investigating the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and Portland State University. The cases were opened using the department's power to launch its own civil rights reviews, unlike the majority of investigations, which stem from complaints. Messages seeking comment were left with all five universities. A statement from the Education Department criticized colleges for tolerating antisemitism after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and a wave of pro-Palestinian protests that followed. It also criticized the Biden administration for negotiating 'toothless' resolutions that failed to hold schools accountable. 'Today, the Department is putting universities, colleges, and K-12 schools on notice: this administration will not tolerate continued institutional indifference to the wellbeing of Jewish students on American campuses,' said Craig Trainor, the agency's acting assistant secretary for civil rights. The department didn't provide details about the inquiries or how it decided which schools are being targeted. Presidents of Columbia and Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of antisemitism. The hearings contributed to the resignation of multiple university presidents, including Columbia's Minouche Shafik. An October report from House Republicans accused Columbia of failing to punish pro-Palestinian students who took over a campus building, and it called Northwestern's negotiations with student protesters a 'stunning capitulation.' House Republicans applauded the new investigations. Representative Tim Walberg, chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, said he was 'glad that we finally have an administration who is taking action to protect Jewish students.' Trump's order also calls for a full review of antisemitism complaints filed with the Education Department since Oct. 7, 2023, including pending and resolved cases from the Biden administration. It encourages the Justice Department to take action to enforce civil rights laws. Last week's order drew backlash from civil rights groups who said it violated First Amendment rights that protect political speech. The new task force announced Monday includes the Justice and Education departments along with Health and Human Services. 'The Department takes seriously our responsibility to eradicate this hatred wherever it is found,' said Leo Terrell, assistant attorney general for civil rights. 'The Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism is the first step in giving life to President Trump's renewed commitment to ending anti-Semitism in our schools.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-opens-antisemitism-inquiries-at-5-colleges-including-columbia-and-berkeley-/7961961.html	2025-02-03T17:11:03-08:00	
Australia hits right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' with sanctions	Sydney — Australia on Monday imposed sanctions on extreme right-wing online network 'Terrorgram' as part of its efforts to combat a rise in antisemitism and online extremism, following similar moves by Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government's action would make it a criminal offense to engage with 'Terrorgram' and help prevent children from becoming caught up in far-right extremism. 'Terrorgram is an online network that promotes white supremacy and racially-motivated violence,' Wong said in a statement. 'It is the first time any Australian Government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an entity based entirely online.' Offenders will face up to 10 years in jail and heavy fines, she said. The Australian government also renewed sanctions on four right-wing groups: the National Socialist Order, the Russian Imperial Movement, Sonnenkrieg Division and The Base, Wong said. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration in January designated 'Terrorgram,' which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. Britain in April made it a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. In a statement, Telegram said calls to violence have no place on its platform. 'Moderators removed several channels that used variations of the 'Terrorgram' name when they were discovered years ago. Similar content is banned whenever it appears,' it said. Australia has also seen an escalating series of attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023, sparking fear among Australia's nearly 115,000 Jewish people. Police last week arrested members of a neo-Nazi group in the South Australian city of Adelaide when the country marked its National Day and charged a man for displaying a Nazi symbol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-hits-right-wing-online-network-terrorgram-with-sanctions/7961963.html	2025-02-03T17:07:08-08:00	
Education Department workers put on leave over DEI order	WASHINGTON — Dozens of employees at the U.S. Education Department were put on paid administrative leave in response to President Donald Trump’s order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, according to a labor union that represents hundreds of workers in the agency. It's unclear how many workers were put on leave or for what reasons, said Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252. The majority of employees placed on leave do not work in DEI initiatives and span all branches of the agency, she said, from an office that sends billions of dollars to K-12 schools to an office that enforces civil rights laws. The shakeup comes as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, pushes to cut programs and federal workers at departments across the government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. A DOGE team was working at the Education Department on Monday to implement Trump's executive orders and agenda, said Madison Biedermann, an Education Department spokesperson. The department did not immediately comment on the personnel changes and would not say how many employees were placed on leave. At least 55 Education Department workers received an email Friday saying they were being put on paid leave effective immediately pursuant to Trump's executive order. It wasn’t being done for 'any disciplinary purpose,' according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. Those placed on leave lost access to their government email accounts and were told not to report to the office. They include a range of staff members and managers across the department, which employs more than 4,000 workers in Washington and regional offices across the country. Most of those on leave appear to have taken a voluntary diversity training seminar offered by the department, Smith said. The Diversity Change Agent program has been promoted by the agency for years, including during Trump’s first term in office. Graduates of the two-day program were expected to serve as role models and help improve the department's 'capacity to attract and retain a diverse workforce,' according to an internal email from 2019 obtained by the AP. Smith said hundreds of employees have taken the training, but it was unclear if all of them were placed on leave. She said many people were under the impression the training was strongly encouraged or required. 'It seems unfair to encourage or require people to take a training and then four or five years later place them on administrative leave,' Smith said. Some current employees who are on leave said the action could disrupt the agency's core work, including the management of federal student loans and the FAFSA form for student financial aid. The workers spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a former teacher and member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Trump is 'purging' employees for taking a training course that his administration encouraged them to take. 'This won’t help our kids learn or even save us money,' Murray said on the social media site X. 'He’s just breaking services people rely on.' Trump’s order called for all DEI staff in the federal government to be put on paid leave and eventually laid off. It’s part of a broader crackdown on diversity programs that the Republican president says are racist. Trump campaigned on a promise to shut down the Education Department, which he says has been infiltrated by 'radicals, zealots and Marxists.' He said the agency's power should be turned over to states and schools.	https://www.voanews.com/a/education-department-workers-put-on-leave-over-dei-order-/7961960.html	2025-02-03T17:05:01-08:00	
US foreign aid programs face major restructuring under Trump	The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which manages tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. foreign aid programs, was essentially closed down on Monday, with employees locked out of their offices and computer systems. Several senior figures in the agency were placed on leave as the Trump administration took steps to fold its functions into the Department of State. Speaking to reporters in El Salvador, where he was traveling, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he is now USAID’s acting director and would be taking steps to bring the agency’s activities in line with the policies of the administration. Rubio described the agency as historically 'unresponsive' to Congress and the White House, even though the agency, he claimed, is supposed to take its direction from the State Department. 'USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that there's somehow a global charity separate from the national interest,' Rubio said. 'These are taxpayer dollars, and we owe the American people assurances that every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest.' Rubio’s comments were less harsh than those of billionaire Elon Musk, who President Donald Trump has given significant power to overhaul the federal government, and whose newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sent representatives into USAID offices over the weekend. 'USAID is a criminal organization,' Musk wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday. 'Time for it to die.' Democrats protest Democrats in Washington described the effort to dismantle USAID as blatantly illegal and vowed to challenge it. On Sunday, all 10 Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Rubio outlining their objections. 'Congress established the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) as an independent agency, separate from the Department of State, to ensure that we can deploy development expertise and U.S. foreign assistance quickly, particularly in times of crisis, to meet our national security goals,' they wrote. 'For this reason, any effort to merge or fold USAID into the Department of State should be, and by law must be, previewed, discussed, and approved by Congress,' the letter said. In a news conference in front of USAID headquarters in Washington, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that he and his colleagues would prevent Trump from filling vacancies at the State Department in response to the administration’s actions. 'We will do everything we can to block State Department nominees from going forward until this illegal action is reversed,' he said. USAID history USAID was created in the early 1960s, at a time when there was a widespread understanding in post-World War II Washington that U.S. aid efforts, administered by a patchwork of agencies, were inefficient, often duplicative, and sometimes contradictory. In many cases, aid was also explicitly tied to the United States’ political priorities, rather than the objective level of need present in nations receiving assistance. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy’s administration undertook a broad review of U.S. aid programs, and he subsequently asked Congress for the authority to develop a new agency to coordinate foreign aid efforts. In a message to Congress, Kennedy proposed an agency that would create country-specific teams that would operate on the ground in recipient nations to develop long-term plans. He described these as 'a carefully thought-through program tailored to meet the needs and the resource potential of each individual country, instead of a series of individual, unrelated projects.' 'Frequently, in the past, our development goals and projects have not been undertaken as integral steps in a long-range economic development program,' Kennedy said. 'Long-term planning and financing — the only way to make meaningful and economical commitments.' Created by executive order Later that year, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, requiring the abolition of several existing aid programs and directing the president to designate a new entity to take responsibility for their operations. The act also explicitly separated foreign military aid from humanitarian aid programs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy signed the bill into law and issued Executive Order 10973, creating the U.S. Agency for International Development. The agency was structured such that its administrator reported directly to the Secretary of State, rather than up through the chain of command within the State Department. It was an arrangement that allowed USAID some freedom of operation, but one that would be challenged repeatedly over the years, as successive secretaries of state sought to force USAID’s priorities into closer alignment with State Department policies. Many successes Over the ensuing 60-plus years, USAID tallied a considerable number of successes, and also weathered numerous controversies and scandals, many of which were catalogued by journalist John Norris in a history of the agency published in 2021, the year of its 60th anniversary. USAID-provided food aid has saved countless lives around the world, and its early focus on developing competent local governance structures was central to helping countries like South Korea and Taiwan develop flourishing industrial bases. In the late 1960s, the agency took on a leading role in the global effort to eradicate smallpox, which had killed an estimated 300 million people since the dawn of the 20th century alone. The agency helped spearhead inoculation programs across the developing world that contributed to the first known global eradication of disease in the human population through a public health program. USAID also helped pioneer the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for children afflicted with diarrhea. By distributing packets of water-soluble salts and sugars, the agency has helped prevent the deaths of millions of children in developing countries. The agency has also been at the forefront of efforts to reduce the incidence in developing countries of mothers’ deaths during childbirth and reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular HIV. Controversies Despite Kennedy’s hope that the distribution of U.S. aid could be disentangled from geopolitics, USAID has, many times in its history, found itself supporting abusive or autocratic governments, frequently in Latin America, because the federal government believed doing so was in the national interest. Public discontent with USAID grew in tandem with frustration at the war in Vietnam, where the agency had played a major role in unsuccessful 'pacification' programs meant to win the 'hearts and minds' of the Vietnamese people. President Richard Nixon attempted to capitalize on that discontent to abolish the agency and decentralize foreign aid programs. Instead, Congress took steps to refocus the agency’s efforts, directing it to back away from high-level engagement with foreign governments in favor of work on rural development and aid to the neediest. In the ensuing years, however, controversies continued to emerge, none more prominent than those arising from the agency’s activities during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Widespread questions were raised, including by members of Congress, about how the agency spent funds earmarked for reconstruction of those two countries.

Judge extends block on Trump administration federal funding freeze	WASHINGTON — A judge in the nation's capital kept a temporary block on a Trump administration plan for a freeze on federal funding Monday after some nonprofit groups said they're still struggling to get promised grants and loans. U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan extended an order she issued last week that paused a sweeping plan to freeze potentially trillions in federal spending. While the memo outlining it has since been rescinded, the Republican administration has said some kind of funding freeze is still planned as part of his blitz of executive orders. A second judge in Rhode Island has also blocked any federal spending pause in a separate lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen Democratic states. In the Washington lawsuit, several groups reported being unable to access promised federal funding even after the memo was rescinded. They ranged from childcare in Wisconsin to disability services in West Virginia to a small business research project on neutron generation and detection. 'For many, the harms caused by the freeze are non-speculative, impending, and potentially catastrophic,' AliKhan wrote. The Trump administration argues a brief pause in funding to align federal spending with the president's agenda is within the law, and the court lacks constitutional authority to block it. President Donald Trump’s executive orders have sought to increase fossil fuel production, remove protections for transgender people and end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. AliKhan though, found that 'furthering the President’s wishes cannot be a blank check for OMB to do as it pleases,' she wrote, referring to the Office of Management and Budget, the White House office that doles out federal money. Lawyers with the advocacy group Democracy Forward are representing the nonprofits. They say the sweeping funding pause breaks federal law, puts nonprofits at risk of being shuttered and violates their First Amendment rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-block-on-trump-administration-federal-funding-freeze-/7961927.html	2025-02-03T16:10:00-08:00	
Tariff threats take aim at fentanyl trafficking; here's how drug reaches US	President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China is partly aimed at combating the illicit flow of fentanyl into the U.S., where the opioid is blamed for some 70,000 overdose deaths annually. Mexico agreed Monday to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a deal with Trump to pause the tariffs for a month — and hold off levying its own. Neither Canada nor China has signaled major changes to tackle the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and each has said it would retaliate for any U.S. tariffs. What role do Mexico, Canada and China play in fentanyl reaching the U.S.? And how much can their governments do? Where does fentanyl come from? The ingredients in fentanyl are largely produced by companies in China and used by pharmaceutical companies to make legal painkillers. But a portion of those chemicals is purchased by the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels in Mexico. Cartels make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the U.S., largely at official land crossings in California and Arizona. The small amounts of fentanyl in any shipment — the drug is 50 times more potent than heroin — and its lack of odor make detection and seizures extremely challenging. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a much lesser extent. U.S. customs agents seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 9,570 kilograms (21,100 pounds) at the Mexican border. Seizures of fentanyl jumped by as much as tenfold under President Joe Biden, an increase that may reflect improved detection. What changed after Trump threatened tariffs? Mexico announced in December the seizure of more than a ton of fentanyl pills in what it described as the largest bust of synthetic opioids in the country's history. The haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of 2024. Under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office in October, Mexico's security forces appear to be far more aggressive than they were under her predecessor. Former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador denied that fentanyl was even produced in Mexico, contradicting officials in his own administration. To pause the tit-for-tat tariffs, Mexico agreed to immediately deploy 10,000 National Guard troops to the border to battle drug-trafficking, while the U.S. committed to do more to stop the trafficking of guns into Mexico, said Trump and Sheinbaum on social media. Facing tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has highlighted his country's recent $1.3 billion investment in border enforcement, including chemical detection tools at entry ports and a new unit focused on the oversight of precursor chemicals. Once Trump ordered the tariffs, Trudeau rebuked the move. 'We, too, are devastated by the scourge that is fentanyl,' Trudeau said at a press conference Sunday. 'As neighbors, we must work collaboratively to fix this. Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together.' China defended its efforts to combat fentanyl in what has been years of touch-and-go cooperation with the U.S. China doesn't have the same fentanyl crisis among its own population, and doesn't view it as a priority, said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. How much can Mexico, Canada and China do? Combating the production and movement of illicit fentanyl is particularly challenging. Unlike heroin and cocaine, which are produced from plants, fentanyl is made with ingredients used for legal pharmaceutical drugs, and can be made in cheap labs that can be erected relatively quickly. And despite the dangers, demand in the U.S. for the highly addictive drug remains strong. Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, said he was skeptical that Mexico’s extra troops at the border on their own would make much of a dent in trafficking. Once fentanyl leaves the labs, it’s usually well concealed in hidden compartments of vehicles or in huge cargo trucks; better detection technology is crucial, in addition to more troops, he said. The other challenge, Vigil said, is that combating the fentanyl trade will likely require more than just collaboration between the U.S. and its neighbors. 'Even if Mexico, Canada and these other countries snap their fingers and did away with the drug trade, as long as we have that demand, there will be another country that will satisfy that demand.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tariff-threats-take-aim-at-fentanyl-trafficking-here-s-how-the-drug-reaches-the-us/7961689.html	2025-02-03T15:43:52-08:00	
Tanker attacked last year crosses Red Sea as Houthi ceasefire holds	CAIRO — Liberian-flagged crude oil tanker Chrysalis, which was attacked by Yemen's Houthis last year, sailed through the Red Sea this week, the Suez Canal said Monday, in one of the first voyages since the militia announced a halt in attacks on ships not linked to Israel. Shipping companies, many of which have suspended Red Sea voyages and rerouted vessels around southern Africa to avoid potential Houthi attacks, have been anxiously waiting for confirmation of safe voyages through the Red Sea since the Gaza ceasefire. The Iran-aligned Houthis, which have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships since November 2023 and sunk two vessels, said on Jan. 20 after the Gaza ceasefire that they would limit their attacks on shipping lanes to Israel-linked vessels. Previously they had targeted ships linked to the U.K. and U.S. although other vessels with no connection have also been hit. 'It is the vessel's first transit since it was attacked in the Red Sea last July,' Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said Monday, hailing the return of the Chrysalis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tanker-attacked-last-year-crosses-red-sea-as-houthi-ceasefire-holds-/7961688.html	2025-02-03T15:41:12-08:00	
Stars, athletes bring buzz to New Orleans before Super Bowl	LOS ANGELES — The Super Bowl isn't just a game on Sunday, it'll involve a nearly weeklong spectacle taking over New Orleans with non-stop entertainment leading up to the big showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. While the Chiefs and Eagles gear up for their championship rematch, the Big Easy will be the epicenter for star-studded concerts, exclusive parties, a comedy show, and guest lists filled with A-listers. From Post Malone, Cardi B to Shaquille O'Neal, the city will be buzzing long before Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs attempt a monumental three-peat. 'It's going to be fun. It's going to be different than other Super Bowls,' said O'Neal, who will host his popular carnival-themed Shaq's Fun House on Friday night. It's a hot ticket — starting at $199 — for the NBA legend's over-the-top festival event featuring headline performances from Ludacris, John Summit and O'Neal under his stage name DJ Diesel. O'Neal's event will feature several attractions including a Ferris wheel, circus performers and premium bar. This will be somewhat of a homecoming week for O'Neal, who played college hoops at Louisiana State University and visits Louisiana about four times a year. For Flavor Flav, he wants to help lift morale in New Orleans following the aftermath of the terror attack that killed 14 people on New Year's Day. 'This is going to be special. I'm here to uplift spirits,' said Flav, who will perform at Guy Fieri's Flavortown Tailgate along with Diplo and Cowboy Mouth on Sunday afternoon. It's free for general admission with paid upgraded experiences for $49.99 and $349 for a VIP ticket. 'I'm getting on the turntables to make people party and have a good time,' he said. Along with those events, here's a look at some of the invite-only and public events during a busy Super Bowl week: Fanatics party Michael Rubin's Fanatics Super Bowl party is impossible to get into without an invite. The star-studded affair on Saturday afternoon is strictly for the who's who of sports and entertainment. Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will likely be front and center, taking in performances from Post Malone, Travis Scott, Don Tolliver and many more. The expected attendees include big names such as Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber, Lil Baby, Tiffany Haddish and Tom Brady. Madden Bowl Just like EA Sports' iconic phrase, 'It's in the game,' Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton and Shaboozey will literally be in the game at the Madden Bowl. The trio is set to separately take the stage Friday night, bringing the hype before the competition kicks off. 'I can't wait to keep this party going,' Shaboozey said. Along with performances, the event will include the Madden NFL 25 Championship Series in front of a live audience — where two of the world's best players will travel to New Orleans for their share of the $1 million prize pool. Double up for some, triple duties for others The Madden Bowl won't be the only stage where Stapleton will showcase his powerhouse vocals.

Ecuador's Noboa closes borders ahead of presidential election	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has announced the closure of Ecuador's borders starting Saturday for three days, including the first round of the presidential election on Sunday in which he is a candidate. 'Faced with attempts at destabilization by armed groups, from Saturday 8 to Monday 10 February, the borders will remain closed,' the leader declared on his social media X account Monday. The 37-year-old head of state also decided to strengthen the military presence in border areas and to 'immediately militarize the ports.' On Saturday, Daniel Noboa spoke of the arrest by his security team of 12 people dressed in police and army uniforms, carrying rifles, ammunition and equipped with a drone, while he was campaigning for his reelection, speaking of 'narco-terrorists' seeking to 'destabilize' the country. Noboa, the son of a billionaire banana king, came to power in November 2023 to complete the 18-month term of his predecessor Guillermo Lasso, who had called early elections to avoid his impeachment amid corruption accusations. In January 2024, the young president declared the country in 'internal armed conflict' after the escape of a powerful drug lord from a Guayaquil prison sparked a wave of violence. In Ecuador, at least twenty gangs are dedicated to drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion, sowing terror and death in this country of 17 million inhabitants. Located on the Pacific and with a dollarized economy, Ecuador — once considered a haven amid Peru and Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producers — has in recent years become a logistical hub for drug shipments. Gang conflicts have sparked unprecedented violence there. In 2023, the country recorded a record rate of 47 homicides per 100,000 people. Through states of emergency including the deployment of the army in the streets, the Noboa government claims to have reduced this homicide rate to 38 by 2024. The liberal president and his left-wing opponent, lawyer Luisa Gonzalez, are due to face off again at the polls Sunday for the first round of the presidential election in Ecuador, after a first electoral contest in October 2023 won by Noboa with 52.1% of the vote. Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza is also a candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7961641.html	2025-02-03T15:04:27-08:00	
Dramatic drop in monarch butterfly count nears record 30-year low	MADISON, WISCONSIN — The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator. Here's what to know: The survey began in 1997 Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast. The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020. The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year. Heat may have doomed western monarchs Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society. It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding. Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 37.7 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) and any temperatures above 42.2 C (108 F) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 37.7 C (100 F). Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 51.1 C (124 F) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records. Western monarchs' future looks murky Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs. 'This is bad news,' Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. 'But we have seen incredible recovery. This doesn’t mean we’re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.' Federal officials working on protections The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing them, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 1,779 hectares (4,395 acres) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs. A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward. Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dramatic-drop-in-monarch-butterfly-count-nears-record-30-year-low-/7961657.html	2025-02-03T15:03:03-08:00	
Uganda begins Ebola vaccine trial	Uganda began a vaccine trial Monday against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday in a post on the X social media platform that the trial was 'initiated with record speed, only three days since the outbreak was declared, while ensuring full compliance with international and national regulatory and ethical requirements.' Officials have not identified the vaccine manufacturer that is providing the East African country with access to more than 2,000 doses of the candidate vaccine. WHO is supporting Uganda’s response to the outbreak with a $1 million allocation from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies. So far, there has been only one death attributed to the virus — a nurse who worked at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda’s capital. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday. The Associated Press reported they were members of the nurse’s family. The nurse sought treatment at several hospitals and had also consulted with a traditional healer before tests confirmed an Ebola diagnosis, according to authorities. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa said in a statement after the outbreak was confirmed, 'We welcome the prompt declaration of this outbreak, and as a comprehensive response is being established, we are supporting the government and partners to scale up measures to quicky identify cases, isolate and provide care, curb the spread of the virus and protect the population.' Uganda’s Health Ministry has identified at least 234 of the nurse’s contacts, according to the AP. Containing the virus could prove challenging in Kampala with its population of 4 million people. The symptoms of Ebola, an often-fatal disease, include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care workers and family members caring for someone with Ebola are at high risk for contracting the disease. WHO said Ebola 'is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.' Ebola’s fatality rate is around 50%, WHO said on its website, but it also said that fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in some outbreaks. The outbreak in Uganda is the first Ebola outbreak since U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization. Some information was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-begins-ebola-vaccine-trial-/7961663.html	2025-02-03T15:01:08-08:00	
Report: China using strict travel restrictions to control Uyghurs	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — In a new report released Monday, Human Rights Watch says the Chinese government continues to impose strict controls on Uyghurs who seek to travel abroad or visit family members living in Xinjiang, measures the New York-based rights organization adds violate their freedom of movement. While Uyghurs have been allowed to apply for passports and briefly reunite with family members, a slight improvement compared to the widespread confiscation of Uyghurs’ passports since 2016, the 'Chinese government continues to deny Uyghurs their right to leave the country, restrict(s) their speech and associations when abroad, and punish(es) them for having foreign ties,' said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. Uluyol told VOA that Beijing uses travel restrictions to maintain control over the Uyghur community at home and abroad and attempts to create 'a public image of normalcy' in Xinjiang. Since 2017, China has put more than a million Uyghurs into internment camps, according to Amnesty International. In 2022, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said Beijing’s treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang may constitute 'crimes against humanity.' Both the previous Trump administration and the administration of former President Joe Biden have voiced concerns about China's treatment of the Uyghurs and characterized what is happening in Xinjiang as genocide and crimes against humanity. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was one of the leading figures in facilitating the passage and enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act during his time as a senator. According to the Human Rights Watch report, Uyghurs in China need to provide detailed information, including their purpose of travel, or personal information of family members abroad, to authorities in Xinjiang. Those permitted to travel abroad need to avoid engaging in activism and must return to China within a specified time, normally between a few days and several months. Some Uyghurs said local 'authorities had told them that only ‘one person from each family’ can travel at the same time, [while others] said authorities had also required them to provide a ‘guarantor’ before granting them permission to travel,' Human Rights Watch said in the report, adding that failure to comply with restrictions could result in harsh punishments against their family members or guarantors. During trips, Uyghurs must check in with a designated official in China regularly, and upon their return, authorities will confiscate their passports. 'Officials from the neighborhood committee, the local police station, and the public security bureau visited my father after his return. They asked about whom he met, where he went, and what he told people,' an unnamed Uyghur told Human Rights Watch. Government-organized trips to Xinjiang In addition to maintaining strict control on Uyghurs seeking to travel abroad, the Chinese government also imposes strict conditions on Uyghurs in the diaspora who want to reunite with family members in Xinjiang. According to the report, Uyghurs with foreign passports need to go through stringent vetting processes to obtain approval from local authorities in Xinjiang. Once they are in China, these Uyghurs are subject to repeated questioning and are only allowed to stay at hotels rather than their relatives’ homes. In some cases, Chinese embassies will tell some Uyghurs abroad to participate in official tours to Xinjiang organized by the local Communist Party propaganda department. Abduweli Ayup, a Uyghur linguist and activist based in Norway, said Chinese embassies in countries like Turkey, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have organized these group tours through Chinese immigrant associations in those countries since 2019. 'Four Chinese immigrant associations were competing to organize these propaganda tours in Turkey,' he told VOA by phone. Before traveling to China, the report said Uyghurs need to provide copies of personal identification and detailed personal information. Once they are in Xinjiang, local authorities will closely monitor them and maintain strict restrictions on them. Uyghurs on these tours 'said they had to seek permission to visit their families and [had] to speak Mandarin Chinese, even among themselves,' Human Rights Watch said in the report. Apart from the strict conditions, Uyghurs visiting Xinjiang will be asked by local authorities to 'take part in propaganda activities,' including praising the Communist Party for its Xinjiang policies. 'I realized everything was orchestrated, the tour was closely surveilled by police, and I had to ask for permission from the neighborhood committee and the local police to stay with my family after the tour,' one unnamed Uyghur told Human Rights Watch. Uluyol said the Chinese government uses these highly restricted trips to Xinjiang to maintain control over Uyghurs in the diaspora community. The Uyghur diaspora begins to 'self-censor while stopping engaging in peaceful political activism or sending their children to Uyghur schools,' he told VOA by phone. He said the Chinese government’s approach, which is a form of transnational repression, 'creates a distrust in the diaspora community' and may lead to the further fragmentation of the community. VOA reached out to China's foreign ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment but has yet to receive a response. Since 2022, the Chinese government has organized several trips to Xinjiang for representatives from foreign countries. During a trip attended by delegates from several Islamic countries in October 2024, Chinese state newspaper China Daily claimed the foreign guests expressed 'their admiration for the social stability, harmony, and collaborative development' among ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Since China is likely to maintain the travel restrictions on Uyghurs, Uluyol said foreign countries should 'protect citizens and residents' from threats posed by Beijing while international bodies like the United Nations should try to prioritize these challenges and address them at the international level.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-using-strict-travel-restrictions-to-control-uyghurs/7961635.html	2025-02-03T14:19:46-08:00	
Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000 Venezuelans	WASHINGTON/MARACAIBO, Venezuela — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump's expanding immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela. Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20 vowing to crack down on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs he says go beyond the intent of U.S. law. Trump tried to end most enrollment in the temporary protection program during his first term but was stymied by federal courts. The status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. 'I don't know what will happen,' said Venezuelan migrant Ana Maria Pirela, 26, who lives in California and has temporary protected status. 'Yesterday they fired my husband from his job — he had been managing a food store for two months — and I'm two months pregnant. I don't want to go back to Venezuela,' she said by phone. Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, greatly expanded the temporary protection program. It now covers more than 1 million people from 17 nations, some in the U.S. for decades, and they could face immediate deportation if they lose the status. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans arrived in the U.S. during Biden's presidency, many via legal humanitarian pathways, and deporting them has been challenging due to frosty U.S.-Venezuela relations. On Saturday, Trump said Venezuela had agreed to accept all deported people but provided few details. Last week, Noem canceled an 18-month extension of temporary protections for Venezuelans by her Biden-era predecessor, saying the Trump administration did not want to be bound by that determination. On Monday, she stopped their status from automatically renewing for six months. About 300,000 additional Venezuelans have Temporary Protected Status that expires in September and were not affected by Monday's decision. The Department of Homeland Security said in the termination notice that while some challenging conditions remain in Venezuela, 'there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.' The termination will be effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the notice said, or about the first week in April. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government has taken some steps to control inflation, which previously was in the triple digits, but economic conditions in Venezuela remain dire for most people. The monthly minimum wage equals about $3. Maduro was inaugurated for his third term in January, despite a six-month-long election dispute, international calls for him to stand aside and an increase in the U.S. reward offered for his capture. The U.S. charged Maduro and several allies with drug trafficking in 2020, charges he denies. The Venezuelan opposition, which has faced arrests and other crackdown measures since the July election, asked the U.S. to keep the temporary protection program in place. Opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who moved abroad after Venezuela issued an arrest warrant for him, recently said on X that the opposition was still discussing with the U.S. how to protect Venezuelans there. Venezuelan migrant Tatiana Vazques, who lives in Atlanta, said by phone that her family submitted a U.S. asylum application but was anxious after seeing other Venezuelans arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 'Yesterday ICE took a friend and her husband. There's anguish,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-moves-to-end-deportation-protections-for-348-000-venezuelans-/7961630.html	2025-02-03T14:07:06-08:00	
Multiple earthquakes rattling Greece's volcanic island of Santorini	Multiple earthquakes are rattling Santorini, a volcanic island in Greece, prompting authorities to dispatch rescuers with tents, a sniffer dog and drones, and to shut schools on four islands. Residents have been warned to avoid indoor gatherings, check escape routes, stay away from cliffs and to drain swimming pools to reduce potential structural damage to buildings in the event of a large earthquake. Greece lies in a highly seismically active part of the world, and earthquakes are frequent. The vast majority cause no injuries and little or no damage, but the country has also seen deadly quakes. Earthquakes can't be predicted, but authorities are taking measures as a precaution. Santorini, one of Greece's most popular tourist destinations, took its present crescent shape following a massive volcanic eruption in antiquity. Now, millions of visitors each year come to see its dramatic scenery of whitewashed houses and blue-domed churches clinging to the cliff along the flooded caldera, or volcanic crater. Last week, scientists said they had noticed increased volcanic activity in the caldera but say this isn't linked to the earthquakes. Here's a look at the current situation: What's going on? About 200 quakes with magnitudes between 3 and 4.9 were registered from Saturday to Monday afternoon between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, authorities said. Seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's ERT television that the seismic activity began on Jan. 24, but intensified Saturday, with increasing frequency and magnitudes. The fault line producing the current earthquakes runs for about 120 kilometers (75 miles), but only the southern part between Santorini and Amorgos has been activated. The earthquakes have epicenters beneath the seabed, roughly 30-40 kilometers (18-25 miles) from any of the islands. Scientists say this is good news, as an epicenter beneath land could potentially be more destructive. But a large quake could also trigger a tsunami, so authorities have warned people to stay away from coastal areas and head inland if they feel a significant earthquake. So far, there has been no damage or injuries reported, although some rockslides have occurred. Could the earthquakes trigger a volcanic eruption? Santorini lies along the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which stretches from the Peloponnese in southern Greece through the Cycladic islands. Last Wednesday, Greece's Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry announced monitoring sensors had picked up 'mild seismic-volcanic activity' inside the island's caldera. Similar volcanic activity had been recorded in 2011, when it lasted for 14 months and ended without any major issues. Another volcano — a submarine one called Kolumbo — lies about 8 kilometers (5 miles) northeast of Santorini, nearer to the epicenter of the current earthquakes. But seismologists say the quakes aren't related to the volcanoes. A meeting between government officials and scientists determined that seismic activity within Santorini's caldera 'remains at the same low levels as in recent days,' the Civil Protection Ministry said Monday, but that it was 'particularly increased' between Santorini and Amorgos. What worries authorities? Scientists are still trying to determine definitively whether the multiple quakes are foreshocks — smaller earthquakes before a major temblor. Papadopoulos said that there was a 'high probability' they are. Santorini's main villages are built along the rim of the volcano's caldera — producing the dramatic scenery of cascading whitewashed houses and sunset viewpoints that make the island so popular but also raising concerns in the event of a major earthquake. The sheer cliffs also make some areas prone to rockslides. What precautions are being taken? Authorities sent a team of rescuers with a sniffer dog and drones to Santorini, where they set up tents in a basketball court next to the island's main hospital as a staging area. Push alerts have been sent to cellphones warning people to stay away from areas where rockslides could occur and banning access to some coastal areas. Residents and hotels have been asked to drain swimming pools, as the water movement in a major quake could destabilize buildings. People have been told to avoid old buildings and check for exit routes when in built-up areas. Schools on Santorini, as well as the nearby islands of Anafi, Amorgos and Ios, will remain shut all week. What's the history? The fault line that has been activated was the site of Greece's largest quake in the last century: a 7.7 magnitude temblor dubbed the Amorgos earthquake that struck in 1956, triggering a roughly 20-meter (65-foot) tsunami, causing significant damage in Amorgos and Santorini and killing more than 50 people. Santorini is also the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history. Known as the Minoan eruption, it occurred around 1,600 B.C. and destroyed much of the formerly round island, giving Santorini its current shape. The eruption is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization. Although it's still an active volcano, the last notable eruption occurred in 1950.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-earthquakes-rattling-greece-s-volcanic-island-of-santorini/7961608.html	2025-02-03T13:57:10-08:00	
Sudan fighting escalates; at least 65 killed	Port Sudan, Sudan — Fierce fighting in south and west Sudan killed at least 65 people and wounded more than 130 Monday, medics said, as the devastating war between the army and paramilitary forces rages on. In South Kordofan, artillery fire on the state capital Kadugli killed at least 40 people and wounded 70, according to two medical sources. The city, controlled by the Sudanese army, was targeted in an attack that Governor Mohamed Ibrahim blamed on a faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu, which also maintains a foothold in the state. 'Hilu's attack on civilians in Kadugli aims to destabilize' the area, Ibrahim said in a statement to AFP, vowing to 'clear the mountains around Kadugli' of rebel forces. The governor said that the shelling targeted a local market. SPLM-N has clashed with both the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in different parts of South Kordofan throughout their war. Sudan has been mired in conflict since April 2023, with battles between the regular army and RSF escalating in recent weeks. In the vast western region of Darfur, a military air strike on South Darfur's capital, Nyala, killed 25 people and wounded 63 on Monday, a medical source told AFP. The attack hit 'the Cinema District in Nyala,' an area under RSF control, the source told AFP on condition of anonymity over safety concerns. The RSF holds sway over much of Darfur, including Nyala, which lies 195 kilometers from El-Fasher, the besieged capital of North Darfur, which is the only state in the region still under army control. El-Fasher is home to some two million people who have been under RSF siege since May. The city has seen some of the worst fighting of the war as the army battles to keep its last foothold in the region. The attacks in South Kordofan and Darfur also come amid intensified fighting between the army and the RSF in Khartoum, where the army has made advances against the paramilitaries. Last week, the army broke a siege of its headquarters in the capital and the Signal Corps in Khartoum North, which had both been encircled by the RSF since the war began. On Saturday, at least 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured when the RSF shelled a busy market in army-controlled Omdurman, part of greater Khartoum. Across the Nile in the capital itself, an air strike on an RSF-controlled area left two civilians dead and dozens wounded, rescuers said. Both warring sides have been repeatedly accused of targeting civilians and indiscriminately shelling residential areas. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted more than 12 million and devastated Sudan 's fragile infrastructure, forcing most health facilities out of service. The U.N.'s migration agency said on Monday that more than 600,000 people have been displaced from North Darfur since April 2024. The International Organization for Migration reported 95 incidents across North Darfur, more than half occurring in El-Fasher. 'These incidents displaced an estimated 605,257 individuals (121,179 households),' the IOM report said. The U.N. secretary-general's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric expressed alarm on Monday over reports of summary executions of civilians in Khartoum North, allegedly by fighters and militias allied with the army. 'Many of the victims of these incidents were allegedly originally from Darfur or the Kordofan regions of Sudan,' he said, calling on all parties to stop fighting and work towards a lasting peace. Sudanese women, children and men 'are paying the price for the continued fighting by the belligerents,' Dujarric added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-fighting-escalates-at-least-65-killed/7961607.html	2025-02-03T13:53:47-08:00	
Gangs attack neighborhood in Haiti that's home to country's elite	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Heavily armed gangs in Haiti have attacked a neighborhood that's home to most of the country's elite and had been largely untouched by criminals, and police have demanded help repelling the assault that has killed at least 40 people. 'It's been eight days since Kenscoff has been under attack,' Mayor Jean Massillon told The Associated Press on Monday. He blamed the attack on the Viv Ansanm gang coalition, with gunmen going home to home and indiscriminately opening fire. 'As we speak, they have surrounded the area,' Massillon said as he called for reinforcements. The dead include pastors, teachers and children, although the number is expected to be higher because authorities haven't been able to reach certain parts of the neighborhood, which is home to many politicians and business leaders. Many victims are working-class people who tend crops on the outskirts of the neighborhood in the foothills of a mountain range. Gangs already control 85% of Port-au-Prince, and the United Nations secretary-general warned last month they could overrun the capital. The assault on Kenscoff occurred days after the government and police warned about imminent attacks in the capital, but the warnings did not say where they might occur. Jean Bertho Valmo, a 45-year-old farmer who fled Kenscoff, told the AP that 12 members of one family were among the dead. He said he woke to another round of gunfire before dawn Monday. He and his family sought shelter in the yard of the mayor's office along with dozens of others. 'There is not enough water and food for everyone,' he said, and lamented the loss of his crops including cabbage, carrots and broccoli. 'I invested everything I had in them,' Valmo said. 'The police, the government need to put a stop to this.' The attack on Kenscoff that began January 27 has left more than 1,660 people homeless, according to the International Organization for Migration on Monday. Overall, gang violence has left more than 1 million people homeless across Haiti in recent years. On Friday, one police union said the attack on Kenscoff 'could have been avoided if police had good equipment' including a helicopter and an all-terrain vehicle, as well as funds to gather intelligence. 'Despite these bad conditions, our policemen are making tireless sacrifices, but we cannot tolerate the negligence of the authorities on what must be done to protect their lives and the safety of the population,' the union, SPNH-17, said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-attack-neighborhood-in-haiti-that-s-home-to-country-s-elite/7961592.html	2025-02-03T13:41:07-08:00

Botswana, De Beers reach diamond sales agreement after years of negotiations	Gaborone, Botswana — The government of Botswana and South African diamond firm De Beers say they have reached a new, 10-year sales agreement following talks that had dragged on since 2019. Analysts say the diamond industry is sure to welcome the deal, as Botswana, after Russia, is the world’s second-largest producer of diamonds. Under terms of the new agreement, Botswana’s government will be allowed to sell 30% of rough diamonds mined through a joint mining venture with De Beers. The share rises to 50% by the end of the deal in 2035. Botswana hopes that will reverse a decline in diamond revenue. The government once received $7 billion a year through De Beers, but that figure declined to $4.2 billion in 2023, amid falling diamond sales worldwide. Addressing journalists on Monday, De Beers CEO Al Cook applauded the new government for ensuring a smooth conclusion to the talks. Under the previous government, negotiations were often tense, with former President Mokgweetsi Masisi threatening to sever ties with De Beers. The talks made more progress once President Duma Boko took over in November. Elodie Daguzan, executive director at the World Diamond Council (WDC), told VOA the organization is happy to see the sides finally reach a deal. 'The World Diamond Council is thrilled about this development which underscores the importance of long-term, stable partnerships in the diamond sector. Botswana has been a leading example of how responsible diamond mining, through successful collaboration with the private sector, can drive sustainable growth,' she said. Daguzan said the agreement will bolster an industry beset by challenges that include consumer worries over so-called 'blood diamonds' and overall cautious consumer spending. 'We believe it will provide much-needed confidence to members of our industry, who are currently navigating a particularly challenging market and seeking signs of stability. At WDC, we remain committed to supporting frameworks that ensure the ethical sourcing, transparency and the continued contribution of diamonds to the well-being of producing nations and communities,' she said. Hans Merket, a researcher on diamond mining, says it was imperative for Botswana and De Beers to reach an agreement, considering the global supply chain disruptions caused by sanctions on Russian diamonds. 'This agreement between the world’s largest diamond producer after Russia, will therefore be seen as a welcome development, not only to both parties but by the industry at large. Hopefully, it will enable the sector to continue advancing a more positive narrative with diamonds contributing to development and well-being, offering a clear alternative to sanctioned stones from Russia,' he said. Botswana’s Minister of Minerals, Bogolo Kenewendo, said her government and De Beers will officially sign the agreement before the end of February. At the end of the new agreement in 2035, there is an option for a five-year renewal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-de-beers-reach-diamond-sales-agreement-after-years-of-negotiations/7961572.html	2025-02-03T13:29:38-08:00	
Pentagon chief travels to Mexico border as Trump cracks down on migration	WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Texas on Monday to visit the southern border as President Donald Trump works to implement a hard-right agenda that includes boosting the U.S. military presence to keep out illegal immigrants. In his first trip as Pentagon chief, Hegseth will survey operations and meet with U.S. troops who have been rushed to the region under Trump. 'Looking forward to meeting our great warriors and seeing the hard work they are doing securing our southern border. We will continue to deliver on this vital mission,' Hegseth wrote on X in a post announcing his arrival. Trump ordered 1,500 additional military personnel to the border just days after taking office, and his administration carried out highly publicized immigration raids and arrests. Some migrants have been deported using military aircraft. Border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico on his first day in office. The additional personnel have increased the total number of active-duty troops deployed there to around 4,000. Ahead of his border visit, Hegseth posted on X that Trump 'wants 100% operational control of the border — and we will deliver.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-travels-to-mexico-border-as-trump-cracks-down-on-migration/7961571.html	2025-02-03T13:22:34-08:00	
US markets pare losses after Trump pauses tariff on Mexican import	U.S. stock markets fell sharply in early trading Monday but pared their losses after President Donald Trump paused a planned 25% tariff on Mexican imports. The three major U.S. stock indices — the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — all dropped nearly 2% or more on fears that Trump’s new tariffs targeting Canada, China and Mexico would threaten the global economy. But the losses were cut in half after Trump paused the levy on Mexican goods for a month, even though his planned 25% tariff on Canadian goods and a 10% levy on Chinese imports were still set to take hold at midnight. Trump was planning further discussions mid-afternoon Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about the tariffs. Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 2.66%, while South Korea’s KOSPI index finished off 2.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading before rallying to close down just .07%. Britain’s FTSE index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 all dropped more than 1%. Canada and Mexico both announced tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump’s move before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told Trump she would send 10,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to try to curb the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S. and Trump paused his tariff on Mexican imports. China has pledged to file a protest with the World Trade Organization over the Trump tariff increase on its exports to the U.S. Canada, China and Mexico are the top three U.S. trade partners. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-markets-pare-losses-after-trump-pauses-tariff-on-mexican-imports/7961533.html	2025-02-03T12:52:13-08:00	
British environmental journalist denied entry to Cambodia	BANGKOK — A journalist who covers environmental issues from Cambodia has been banned from entering the country where he has been based for the past five years. British reporter Gerry Flynn told VOA that immigration officials denied his re-entry to Cambodia on Jan. 5, when he tried to return after a vacation in Thailand. The journalist went public with the incident Monday. 'It’s not just a professional blow, but very personal, too,' Flynn told VOA by phone. 'We’ve all seen in the last five years, press freedom [has] deteriorated there.' Flynn, 33, is staff writer at Mongabay, a news website that reports on environmental issues worldwide. He has spent five years reporting from Siem Reap in Cambodia’s northwest, covering environmental and governance issues. The first sign of a possible problem came on January 2, when Flynn says he was stopped at the Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport prior to departing Cambodia. Authorities told Flynn that one of the documents in his visa applications was fake. But, the reporter said, he was allowed to embark on his trip to visit Moo Deng, a baby endangered pygmy hippopotamus that has become a worldwide tourist attraction in Thailand. When he returned three days later, Flynn said he was questioned again. 'This time they didn’t mess around. They were just straight away saying that my visa had been acquired fraudulently. They couldn’t tell me which document was supposed to be incorrect or fake,' he said. 'The only thing they would tell me is that I’d been placed on the blacklist on November 25, 2024.' Immigration officials told Flynn he was banned indefinitely and would not be able to return to Cambodia. Denied entry, the journalist traveled back to Thailand. Flynn has a one-year Type E business visa, valid through February 2025, and a valid work permit issued by Cambodia’s labor ministry. His press accreditation expired January 1, but he had applied to renew the pass. His news outlet, Mongabay, has said that it believes the action is retaliatory. Flynn recently featured as a contributor to a France24 documentary, 'Real carbon, false credits? Investigating mass deforestation in Cambodia'. The documentary focuses on carbon-offset projects in the Cardamom Mountains. After it aired on November 22, Cambodia’s government labeled the findings 'fake news.' Two other contributors were detained a day after it aired, but later released, according to Mongabay. Neither Cambodia’s government, Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor its press communications division replied to VOA’s emails requesting comment. Mongabay on Monday said Cambodian authorities have not provided further information to Flynn about his case or his options to appeal. In a statement, Mongabay said that Cambodia claims Flynn had applied for a visa to work as an electrician. But Mongabay said Flynn has 'consistently held a valid government-issued press pass ... in Cambodia.' 'For more than five years, Flynn has reported from Cambodia, and despite the increasing hostility towards journalists, it’s a country that he’s grown to love,' the statement said. 'As such, it’s both a professional and personal blow to be uprooted from the country Flynn has called home in what appears to be direct retaliation for his journalistic work.' International media watchdogs have condemned Cambodia’s action. 'The immigration entry ban on journalist Gerry Flynn shows just how far Cambodian authorities are willing to go to suppress independent reporting on the country’s environmental catastrophe,' Shawn Crispin, the senior Southeast Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalist, told VOA by email. Crispin noted that Flynn has reported on deforestation in Cambodia, adding, 'His expose journalism no doubt made people in powerful positions who profit from the illegal trade very uncomfortable.' Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA, 'Cambodia is working overtime to wipe out what's left of media freedom in the country.' Reporting or campaigning about environmental issues in Cambodia can be risky. Local journalist Chhoeung Chheng died from his injuries after being shot in Siem Reap province in December while investigating deforestation. In July, 10 members of Cambodian environmental activist group Mother Nature were sentenced from six to eight years in prison for conspiring against the state. The group had been investigating waste pollution in Phnom Penh’s Tonle Sap River. Mother Nature had campaigned against the destruction of natural resources throughout Cambodia and corruption. Overall, Cambodia has a poor record for press freedom. It ranks 151 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media scene. Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, describes a 'legacy of repression against the independent media.' In November, an investigative journalist who helped expose the existence of massive scam centers in Cambodia announced that he was quitting. The journalist, Mech Dara, was detained for 30 days and charged with incitement, which carries a potential sentence of up to two years in prison. Two other local reporters who investigated mistreatment of workers at a scam center were detained in late January, according to watchdogs. Flynn, who is the president of the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia, said that until recently Cambodia 'refrained from going after foreign journalists.' 'All journalists, whether foreign or Cambodian all face varying levels of harassment in the field. I know some who were arbitrarily detained while working,' he said. According to a quarterly review report from the Cambodian Journalist Alliance, more than a dozen journalists were legally or physically harassed between July and September of 2024. Reflecting on his case, Flynn said, 'I think the biggest annoyance is it has eaten the whole month, when in reality that month should have been spent continuing to report on important issues in Cambodia.' 'For me it’s obviously a setback but it is not going to stop either myself or others from reporting on issues related to the environment,' Flynn added. 'I don’t think silencing journalists is going to prevent people from seeing the problems that are happening.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/british-environmental-journalist-denied-entry-to-cambodia/7961415.html	2025-02-03T12:34:16-08:00	
Trump orders creation of US sovereign wealth fund, says it could buy TikTok	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday ordering the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments to create a sovereign wealth fund and said it may purchase TikTok. 'We're going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We're going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people,' he told reporters. 'There'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country as we work to bring them out for the American people.' Trump had previously floated such a government investment vehicle as a presidential candidate, saying it could fund 'great national endeavors' like infrastructure projects such as highways and airports, manufacturing, and medical research. Details on how exactly the fund would operate and be financed were not immediately available, but Trump previously said it could be funded by 'tariffs and other intelligent things.' Typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus to make investments, but the U.S. operates at a deficit. There are over 90 such funds across the world managing over $8 trillion in assets, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. TikTok, which has about 170 million American users, was briefly taken offline just before a law requiring its Chinese owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. Trump, after taking office on Jan. 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law. Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in February.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-creation-of-us-sovereign-wealth-fund-says-it-could-buy-tiktok/7961449.html	2025-02-03T12:12:40-08:00	
Trump talk' takes center stage at African mining conference	CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA — The 31st Investing in African Mining Indaba is underway in Cape Town, South Africa with over 115 countries represented. At the forefront of many discussions are the plans of U.S. President Donald Trump, and the effect that U.S. tariffs and the freeze on foreign aid might have on Africa’s mining industries. The theme of this year’s conference is 'Future-proofing African Mining, Today.' However, some participants are concerned that tariffs imposed by Trump — most notably the 10% tariff on Chinese goods announced Saturday — will make this mission much harder. Denys Denya, senior executive vice president of Afreximbank, which is involved in funding trade expansion projects, said tariffs are dominating their talks, but answers are few so far. 'Because China sources lots of its minerals from Africa that go into its manufacturing which then gets exported, there’s a potential negative knock-on effect on African mining, if the demand is not there as a result of the tariff,' Denya said. 'But we are waiting to see what the impact will be. At the moment we can speculate, but we don’t really have the evidence.' Trump’s decision to freeze U.S. foreign aid was also a topic of discussion. South Africa’s Minister of Minerals and Petroleum Resources, Gwede Mantashe, told delegates in his opening address that Africa should withhold minerals if funding is withdrawn. But Denya had an opposing view. 'I think every administration has a right to determine how national resources are going to be deployed, so the Trump administration has a right to determine where to use their resources and we cannot impose on the United States to continue to fund certain activities. So, it’s up to the American people to decide,' Denya said. Veteran mining analyst Peter Major said that unlike China, the U.S. has been cautious with its investments in Africa, due to several factors including political instability on the continent. A case in point is the current conflict in the mineral-rich eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where M23 rebels and the Congolese government are fighting for control. Major urged the U.S. to continue with the Lobito Corridor, a rail project for the transport of minerals from Congo and Zambia to the port of Lobito in Angola on the Atlantic coast. The project was supported by former President Joe Biden’s administration. 'I think it was the U.S. putting a toe in the water and they mustn’t stop now,' Major said. 'They must put the foot in the water, they must get the leg in there, they must maximize the value and leverage of that project and show Africa how keen they are to come here and help under reasonable, logical, beneficially good terms for all players.' Africa is believed to hold 30% of the world’s minerals, some of them traditional sources of wealth like diamonds and gold, others used in products like batteries and electric vehicles, regarded as critical for the transition to cleaner energy sources. Delegates at the conference, which runs until Feb. 6, represent mining companies, investors and governments. There is a delegation from the United States, but all media inquiries are being directed to Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-talk-takes-center-stage-at-african-mining-conference/7961424.html	2025-02-03T11:39:27-08:00	
Exclusive: US 'aware' of reports Iran trying to ship missile propellant chemical from China	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has made its first comment on Western media reports that Iran is trying to ship a missile propellant ingredient from China, telling VOA it is aware of the reports published last month, while declining to confirm their veracity. Responding to a VOA query about the purported Iranian scheme, a State Department spokesperson said in a Jan. 30 statement, 'We are aware of the press reports. However, we do not comment on intelligence matters.' Britain’s Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal in the United States published reports on Jan. 22 and 23 respectively, citing unnamed Western officials as saying Iran-flagged ships Golbon and Jairan were in the process of being loaded with 1,000 metric tons of sodium perchlorate near Ningbo on China’s eastern coast. The Financial Times described its sources as 'security officials' in two Western countries, while The Wall Street Journal attributed the same information to a 'Western official' and other 'people familiar with the matter.' The news outlets said the purported shipment could be transformed into enough ammonium perchlorate — a key solid fuel propellant component — to produce 260 midrange Iranian missiles. Both the Golbon container ship and the Jairan cargo ship are sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. The vessels’ appearance on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List means they are blocked from U.S.-related commerce. In its statement, the State Department said the U.S. 'remains focused on preventing the proliferation of items, equipment, and technology that could benefit Iran’s missile or other weapons programs and continues to hold Iran accountable through sanctions.' A spokesman for Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York did not respond to a VOA request emailed on Friday to confirm whether Iran is using the Golbon and Jairan to ship sodium perchlorate from China, and whether Western media reports have prompted any changes to the alleged scheme. Iran has a decades-old economic and military partnership with China, which was formalized in a 2021 cooperation agreement that called for more joint military exercises and weapon-systems development as both nations seek to counter what they see as U.S. global hegemony. But the two sides have not confirmed any Chinese weapons sales to Iran since the agreement’s signing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning responded to the Western media reports in a Jan. 23 press briefing, saying Beijing was unaware of the situation with the Iranian ships. She also asserted that Beijing always abides by its own export controls and international obligations and rejects other countries imposing what it considers to be illegal unilateral sanctions. Ammonium perchlorate, for which sodium perchlorate is a precursor, is subject to export controls under the Missile Technology Control Regime, an informal association of 35 governments sharing common interests in the nonproliferation of missiles. Neither Iran nor China are members of the voluntary export-control organization, which includes mostly Western nations and their Asian allies, as well as Russia. Iran makes its own chemicals for the production of solid fuel missile propellant, according to Behnam Ben Taleblu, a researcher at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But he told VOA in an interview that after Israel destroyed much of Iran’s missile manufacturing in an aerial attack last October, Iranian military planners have an urgent need for backup supplies. 'It makes sense for Iran to try to obtain more of these precursor chemicals from China because Tehran sees Beijing as a more trusted partner than other nations,' Ben Taleblu said. In another development, a joint review of ship tracking websites by VOA and Dubai-based intelligence analyst Martin Kelly of EOS Risk Group in recent days has uncovered new details of the movements and loading statuses of the Golbon and Jairan since Western media first reported their roles in the alleged Iranian import scheme. The reviews of websites MarineTraffic and Lloyd’s List Intelligence’s Seasearcher show the Golbon had a draught change on Jan. 22 at sea near Zhoushan Island off the coast of Ningbo. The ship was noted sitting two meters deeper in the water, an indication that it was loaded with cargo in a ship-to-ship transfer from another vessel, Kelly said. No cargo ship could be seen adjacent to the Golbon on that date on MarineTraffic. Vessels engaged in illicit ship-to-ship transfers often switch off their Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders — devices that transmit positional and other data as part of an internationally mandated tracking system — to evade detection, as noted in a 2023 U.S. government advisory highlighting common tactics deployed by malign actors in the maritime industry. After the Jan. 22 draught change, the Golbon headed north toward a stated destination of Taicang port near Shanghai on the same day, but it stopped short and remained stationary at sea for the next three days, according to MarineTraffic. On Jan. 25, the Golbon changed its stated destination and headed south toward southern China’s Zhuhai Gaolan Port. The anonymous sources cited by the Financial Times on Jan. 22 said they expected the Golbon and the Jairan to deliver their purported cargos of sodium perchlorate straight to Iran on a three-week voyage without making any port calls. But the Golbon arrived at Zhuhai Gaolan Port on Jan. 30 and remained there for two days before departing with another draught change, according to MarineTraffic. Upon departure, the Golbon was sitting several meters deeper in the water, indicating a further loading of cargo during the port call. It also reported a new destination of Iran’s Bandar Abbas port and an estimated arrival of Feb. 14. As the Golbon had a draught change near Zhoushan Island on Jan. 22, the Jairan was docked at Liuheng Island, about 30 kilometers to the south. The Financial Times cited its sources as saying the Jairan would depart for Iran with newly loaded cargo early this month. But the ship remained docked at Liuheng on Monday, sitting at the same depth in the water as when it was in the waters off southern China in November and heading north toward the Ningbo coast, according to Seasearcher. It was an indication that the Jairan has not been loaded with any significant cargo since November, Kelly said. There was no word on which Chinese manufacturers may be involved in the purported scheme to supply the sodium perchlorate to Iran. The U.S. has long sanctioned Chinese companies for providing missile components to Iran, but a VOA search of U.S. government websites found no specific references to sanctions on Chinese manufacturers of sodium perchlorate. The Treasury Department did not respond to a VOA inquiry, sent on Friday, regarding whether the U.S. has sanctioned Chinese makers of the chemical. The U.S. sanctioned Iranian government defense company Parchin Chemical Industries in 2008 and its suspected agents in 2022 for procuring ballistic missile propellant-related materials from abroad for use by Iran’s top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-us-aware-of-reports-iran-is-trying-to-ship-missile-propellant-chemical-from-china/7961368.html	2025-02-03T11:19:17-08:00	
Djibouti drone strike kills at least 8 near Ethiopian border	Djibouti's security forces executed a drone strike near the Ethiopian border, killing eight members of what it calls a terrorist group and harming an unspecified number of civilians, officials said on Sunday. 'A drone attack was carried out against a terrorist group at Addorta, a Djiboutian locality some six kilometers from the border with Ethiopia,' a statement from the Djibouti defense ministry said. The statement said that the defense ministry confirmed that 'eight terrorists were neutralized,' but also noted that 'collateral damage was unfortunately reported among Djiboutian civilians,' without providing further details. In comments to AFP, Alexis Mohamed, an adviser to President Ismael Omar Guelleh, identified the militants as members of the Armed Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy, or FRUDA, which Djibouti classifies as a terrorist organization. The government said the group was involved in 'hostile actions' that posed 'a potential threat to our advanced posts.' An Ethiopian newspaper, the Addis Standard, reported that the drone strike occurred on Ethiopian territory — an assertion Djibouti rejected. Mohamed maintained that the attack took place within Djibouti's borders. Djibouti security officials did not respond to requests from VOA Somali to provide further details regarding the incident. In October 2022, an attack on barracks at Garabtisan, in the north of Djibouti, resulted in the deaths of seven soldiers and the kidnapping of six others. Officials in Djibouti blamed the attack on FRUD, the political arm of FRUDA. The abducted soldiers were released several weeks later. In 1991, FRUD, which originated in the Afar community in northern Djibouti, launched an anti-government insurgency, claiming to represent Afar interests against the Issas, the other major ethnic group in the tiny Horn of Africa country. Later, the group broke up, joining a four-party coalition that backs President Guelleh, but its armed wing, called FRUDA, has continued to carry out attacks against government forces. Several countries, including the United States and China, have military installations in Djibouti. The country sits on the west side of the Bab El Mandeb Strait, in East Africa. along one of the world's busiest maritime routes where the Red Sea meets the Gulf of Aden. Djibouti’s news comes two days after U.S. aircraft took aim at the Islamic State affiliate in neighboring Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold.

WHO urges US to reconsider withdrawal, warns of budget impact	The World Health Organization (WHO) has renewed its call for the United States to reverse its decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, warning of potential global health consequences and budget concerns. In his opening remarks at an executive board meeting on Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told attendees the health agency regrets the U.S. decision and hopes Washington will reconsider. 'We would welcome constructive dialogue to preserve and strengthen the historic relationship between WHO and the USA that helped bring significant impacts like the eradication of smallpox,' Tedros said, according to a WHO transcript of his speech. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order announcing his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO. According to financing data from the WHO, the U.S. contributed an estimated $988 million between January and November of 2024, marking approximately 14% of the WHO’s $6.9 billion budget. A document presented at a WHO budget meeting last week and obtained by The Associated Press said that U.S. funding 'provides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations.' This funding has been aimed toward combatting disease globally. For example, U.S. funding covers 95% of the WHO’s tuberculosis in Europe, along with 60% of the agency’s TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific, and headquarters in Geneva. In addition, as a result of U.S. withdrawal, the WHO’s responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk along with its polio-eradication and HIV programs, the document said. President Trump’s executive order cited four key reasons for Washington’s withdrawal. It said the WHO organization mishandled global health projects such as COVID-19 and failed to implement reform programs. It also said the WHO organization failed to 'demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states' and 'continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments.' In his call for the U.S. to reconsider its position Tedros said the WHO has implemented its deepest and most wide-ranging reforms over the past seven years. Those reforms, he said in his remarks, have 'touched every part of our work: our strategy, operating model, processes, partnerships, financing, workforce and culture.' In the health agency’s defense, he added that the WHO has implemented reforms focused on addressing financing imbalances, responded appropriately to the COVID-19 crisis and has been impartial existing to serve the needs of all countries and peoples. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-urges-us-to-reconsider-withdrawal-warns-of-budget-impact-/7961350.html	2025-02-03T11:07:36-08:00

Musk is 'special government employee,' White House confirms	Washington — Elon Musk is working for President Donald Trump as a 'special government employee,' according to a White House official, solidifying his controversial role in the administration but sidestepping some disclosure rules that are typical of federal workers. The official, speaking Monday on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said that Musk has a government email address and office space in the White House complex. Musk, the world's richest man, has been granted broad latitude by Trump to reduce the size of the federal government. On Monday morning, the headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International Development was abruptly shut down. Musk's team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, also has received access to sensitive payment systems at the U.S. Treasury Department. Democrats fear that Musk is consolidating power within the federal government, acting without accountability and potentially against the law. Special government employees are usually appointed to their position for up to 130 days. It's unclear how standard rules on ethics agreements and financial disclosures will apply to Musk, who has billions of dollars in federal contracts with SpaceX, his rocket company. Musk does not receive a paycheck for his work, the White House official said. Under federal guidelines, it's unlikely that he will need to file a public financial disclosure report. The official did not provide additional details apart from saying that Musk is following the law. Trump signaled his approval of Musk's work on Sunday evening after returning to Washington from his weekend in Florida. 'I think Elon is doing a good job. He's a big cost-cutter,' the Republican president said. 'Sometimes we won't agree with it and we'll not go where he wants to go. But I think he's doing a great job.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-is-special-government-employee-white-house-confirms-/7961332.html	2025-02-03T10:40:36-08:00	
Uganda's Supreme Court bans military trials for civilians; government rejects ruling	NAIROBI — Uganda’s Supreme Court recently ruled that trying civilians in military courts is unconstitutional. Human rights groups welcomed the decision as a major step in protecting the right to a fair trial, but the government criticized the move. Human Rights Watch’s senior researcher Oryem Nyeko said the decision is encouraging, as it reflects the values of human rights and the right to a fair trial. The idea that civilians should not be tried in military courts is something that is agreed upon at many levels, including in international law, Nyeko added. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni criticized the ruling, saying the country is not governed by judges but by the people. Museveni defended the military courts, saying its trials reinforce the civilian judicial system to defend the lives of people against armed criminals. According to rights groups, Ugandan military courts have tried hundreds of civilians, including opposition politicians and government critics. In 2016, former Parliament member Michael Kabaziguruka was charged with security-related offenses and tried in a military court. In successfully petitioning the Supreme Court, he argued that it was against the law for him and other civilians to face a General Court Martial (GCM). Kabaziguruka argued that the GCM was incapable of dispensing justice, so no one who went there expected justice to be served. Instead, he said, the GCM has been used as a tool of repression by the government to fight its political opponents. The court’s ruling has given hope to opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who was abducted in Kenya in November and days later appeared before a military court in Kampala. He faces the death penalty for treason. Despite the high court ruling, his court-martial case is expected to continue. Army spokesperson Chris Magezi said a military court can try any person accused of conspiring to kill the president or accused of committing armed rebellion or terrorism against Uganda. Kabaziguruka said he isn’t interested in the president’s criticisms, as the Supreme Court ruling over the courts-martial issue is final. The president can rant, Kabaziguruka said, but he cannot change the ruling. Kabaziguruka also said that civilian defendants in military courts are treated poorly and tortured by soldiers, leaving an indelible mark. Museveni argued that military courts are beneficial to the country's security and ordered the attorney general to propose constitutional amendments to prevent judges from interfering with their work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-supreme-court-bans-military-trials-for-civilians-government-rejects-ruling/7961182.html	2025-02-03T09:03:32-08:00	
Bird flu pandemic potential in US worries scientists, farmers	The recent outbreak of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in the U.S. and the potential for it to mutate has raised concerns among the scientific community that it could result in human-to-human transmission and a new pandemic. Farmers are also concerned about the potential impacts on their livelihood. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-pandemic-potential-in-us-worries-scientists-farmers/7961183.html	2025-02-03T08:59:24-08:00	
Spanish soccer boss pleads not guilty in ‘kiss’ trial	Madrid — A female Spanish soccer player told a court Monday that her boss kissed her against her will as millions watched on television, then pressured her to say it was consensual, in a case widely seen as putting machismo in sport on trial. Jenni Hermoso testified before Madrid’s High Court as Luis Rubiales, the former president of the Spanish Soccer Federation, went on trial facing charges of sexual assault and coercion. Rubiales entered a plea of not guilty. The 47-year-old prompted outrage in 2023 as he cupped star player Hermoso’s head and gave her an unsolicited kiss on the mouth after Spain beat England to win the Women’s World Cup Final in Australia. In the hours after the incident, Rubiales allegedly tried to pressure Hermoso into saying that the kiss was consensual. The furor partially overshadowed Spain’s triumph and prompted Spain’s own #MeToo moment when women posted #SeAcabo — it’s over — on social media, signaling they would not tolerate macho treatment in sport anymore. In a highly anticipated trial, beamed live on television in Spain, Hermoso told the court she felt disrespected as a woman. 'My boss was kissing me, and this shouldn’t happen in any social or work setting. A kiss on the lips has a connotation that goes beyond a kiss of courtesy and friendship,' she said. 'As a woman I felt disrespected. It was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life. For me it is very important to say that at no point did I seek that act, let alone expect it.' After the final in Australia, Hermoso said on the team’s journey back to Spain, she said she came under pressure from Rubiales and other soccer federation officials to agree to a statement which said it was a consensual kiss. 'They had never asked me about it,' she said. 'I said no.' Hermoso said she was also asked to make a video with Rubiales for the media when the team’s plane stopped off in Doha on the way back, to downplay the incident. She said she refused. Hermoso said when she returned to Spain, she received death threats and had to leave Madrid with her family. 'I had cameramen outside my house 24/7 and cars. I received death threats. I had to leave Madrid with my family. It was impossible to be there,' she said. She said she had to see her psychologist more than normal because of the repercussions of the case. 'I didn’t choose this. I never would. Why did this have to happen to me? Until today, it feels like my life has been on standby' because of the case, she said. A recent reform of the Spanish penal code classified a non-consensual kiss as sexual assault. Rubiales, who had been soccer federation chief since 2018, initially dismissed the kiss as a 'peck' but gave in to pressure and resigned in September 2023 after an investigation began into the case. Amid huge international media interest, the trial in Madrid is expected to run for three weeks. Then the judges will retire to consider their verdicts. Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales if he is convicted on the sexual assault charges. Three other former soccer officials are also accused of trying to coerce Hermoso into saying that the kiss was consensual. They are ex-women’s national team coach Jorge Vilda and two other Spanish soccer federation officials Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque. All face prison terms of up to 18 months in prison if convicted but deny coercion. Four teammates from Spain’s soccer team are expected to appear as witnesses for the prosecution. Misa Roriguez, Alexia Putellas, Irene Paredes and Laia Condia, who all play for teams in Spain or Britain, will appear during the trial. Rubiales, who is expected to take the stand on February 12, has denied coercing Hermoso into the kiss. The case has gripped Spain. Before the trial got under way, Equality Minister Ana Redondo posted on social media X: 'Thanks to you [Jenni] and your teammates we added another victory for feminism.' In the days after the scandal blew up, the saga took an unexpected turn when Rubiales’ mother Angeles Bejar started a brief hunger strike in support of her son inside a Catholic Church in the family’s hometown of Motril in southern Spain. In a sign that this was a defining moment not just for Spanish sport but for women’s rights, the country’s World Cup women’s soccer team staged a temporary strike and refused to play under the existing managers of the Spanish federation. Women have made great advances in recent years in Spain. Half of the 22 cabinet posts in the Spanish government are occupied by women, from the treasury to labor ministries. Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional leader who is a star figure of the conservative opposition, is considered a possible future prime minister. With 74.6 out of 100 points, Spain ranks 6th in the European Union on the gender equality index,six points above the EU average.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-soccer-boss-pleads-not-guilty-in-kiss-trial-/7961045.html	2025-02-03T08:36:39-08:00	
Rubio hails US-Panama cooperation as deportation flight returns undocumented Colombians	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said cooperation with Panama has sent 'a clear message' the U.S. will act to curb illegal immigration, as he observed a U.S.-funded deportation flight departing from Albrook International Airport in Panama on Monday morning. The flight returned dozens of undocumented Colombians to their home country. According to a Colombian official, 32 men and 11 women were repatriated, including seven individuals with criminal records. On July 1, 2024 — the first day of Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino’s term — the U.S. and Panama signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) aimed at jointly reducing the number of migrants illegally crossing through Panama’s Darien region en route to the United States. The program is funded by the U.S. State Department and implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Monday’s deportation was carried out under the MOU and following a State Department waiver that lifted a previous pause on U.S. foreign aid. 'This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,' Rubio told reporters at the Albrook International Airport. 'This flight today was possible due to a waiver that we've issued,' he added. 'We’re going to issue a broader one to continue this cooperation.' Under the 2024 MOU, the United States has provided nearly $2.7 million to fund flights and tickets to repatriate migrants to their countries of origin. Since the first repatriation flight on August 20, 2024, over 40 charter flights have been conducted from Panama to more than 14 countries, returning more than 1,700 undocumented migrants. Destinations have included Colombia, Ecuador, India, and Vietnam. Panama recently reported a 90% decrease in migrants crossing the Darien region compared to the same period last year. Canal controversy On Sunday, Rubio warned Panama that Washington will 'take necessary measures' if Panama does not take immediate steps to end what U.S. President Donald Trump described as China's 'influence and control' over the Panama Canal. 'Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement after Rubio’s talks with Mulino. Mulino also announced that Panama has decided not to renew a 2017 memorandum with China on Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative and will seek to void agreements with the Chinese government before their official expiration dates. 'We'll study the possibility of terminating it early,' Mulino added on Sunday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' Rubio will next head to El Salvador where he will meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-hails-us-panama-cooperation-as-deportation-flight-returns-undocumented-colombians/7961094.html	2025-02-03T07:54:41-08:00	
Film director found guilty of sexual assault in France's first big #MeToo trial	Paris — Film director found guilty of sexual assault in France's first big #MeToo trial PARIS (AP) — A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Adèle Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country's first big #MeToo trial. Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing. Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie 'Les Diables,' or 'The Devils,' in the early 2000s. Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women's rights activists as she left the courtroom. The court ruled that Ruggia 'took advantage of the dominant position' he had on Haenel at the time. 'During quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,' as Haenel was 'gradually isolated' from her loved ones, the court said in a statement. Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal. He 'maintains that he has never touched Adèle Haenel,' the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. 'Sentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.' Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire,' has in recent years vocally protested what she's called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking. At the César Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for 'complacency toward sexual aggressors.' She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are 'ready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.' While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out. French renowned actor Judith Godrèche attended Monday's verdict at the Paris courthouse. 'It was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,' she told reporters with tears in her eyes. Last year, Godrèche accused film director Benoît Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024. Godrèche is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15. Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations. In a separate case, French actor Gérard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set. Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using 'violence, coercion, surprise or threat' in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of 'Les Volets verts,' or 'The Green Shutters.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/film-director-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault-in-france-s-first-big-metoo-trial-/7960993.html	2025-02-03T06:40:18-08:00	
Crews return to the Potomac River to recover wreckage from DC midair collision	Arlington — Crews were on the scene on the Potomac River on Monday to retrieve the submerged wreckage of an airliner and an Army helicopter that collided midair in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001. Authorities have recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed in the crash and Washington, D.C., Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly has said they are confident all will be found. Crews were expected to begin the work of lifting the wreckage on Monday and at daybreak they could be seen aboard a vessel with a crane. More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. Divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found, Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday. The 'dignified recovery' of remains takes precedence over all else, he said. Portions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard — will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for investigation. The crash occurred when the jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no survivors. On Sunday, family members were taken in buses with a police escort to the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after colliding. The plane's passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the helicopter. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the collision. Full investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Wednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. Experts stress that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan Airport can challenge even experienced pilots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-return-to-the-potomac-river-to-recover-wreckage-from-dc-midair-collision-/7960955.html	2025-02-03T06:09:57-08:00	
Pakistan sets deadline for Western nations to relocate Afghan allies	Islamabad — Pakistan has decided to deport thousands of Afghan nationals if Western countries, including the United States, do not relocate them as promised for resettlement abroad by the end of March, officials confirmed Monday. The individuals in question took refuge in Pakistan after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021, primarily seeking shelter from potential retribution due to their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces. Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan recently reported that 'almost 80,000' Afghans have so far been 'taken by various countries for resettlement, and around 40,000 are still in Pakistan.' They reportedly include an estimated 15,000 Afghans to be approved for resettlement in the U.S. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif led a meeting in Islamabad to discuss the status of nearly three million Afghan refugees residing in the country, including documented and undocumented refugees, economic migrants, and those who are awaiting resettlement to a third country. A post-meeting document seen by VOA on Monday outlines a multi-stage repatriation plan, requiring authorities to move 'Afghan nationals bound for 3rd country resettlement' out of the Pakistani capital and adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi by March 31, 2025. It did not elaborate. Sharif directed the foreign ministry 'to ensure coordination with foreign [diplomatic] missions for their relocation, including to their intended destinations, failing which they will also be repatriated to Afghanistan.' The U.S. and allied troops withdrew from Afghanistan just days after the Taliban swept back to power in Kabul three-and-a-half years ago. The withdrawal ended a nearly two-decade-long U.S. involvement in the Afghan war, with coalition forces also evacuating tens of thousands of Afghan allies with a pledge to resettle them abroad. Many of them were airlifted and transported to Pakistan temporarily. Last month, new President Donald Trump’s administration announced the suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admission Program, saying the pause was intended to assess whether reinstating the program serves the interests of Washington. The announcement further complicated the Afghans' already slow and complex relocation process. Under the Pakistani plan, Sharif has also directed authorities to immediately relocate all legal Afghan migrants, including those without residential permits, from Islamabad and Rawalpindi and repatriate them to Afghanistan. Although specific figures were not provided, official estimates indicate that the number of migrants with legal status in Pakistan exceeds 800,000 holding the Afghan Citizen Card, or ACC. The official document outlining the deportation stages emphasized that no public announcement should be made regarding the planned deportations of Afghans, and it 'shall be ensured that they do not return once repatriated.' Pakistani authorities have already forced more than 800,000 undocumented Afghans out of the country since launching an official crackdown on foreign immigrants lacking documents or visas in late 2023. Pakistan is home to more than one million Afghans recognized by the United Nations as lawfully registered refugees, holding a Proof of Registration, or POR, card. The Sharif government has granted POR cardholders permission to remain in Pakistan until June 30, 2025. These families primarily consist of those who escaped decades of war, persecution, and the previous Islamist Taliban regime in Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. The majority of the lawful refugees are either born or raised in Pakistan and are hesitant to return to a country that feels unfamiliar to them, according to officials from the U.N. refugee agency. Moreover, the U.N. says that years of conflicts, natural disasters, and deepening economic troubles after the Taliban takeover have worsened a long-running humanitarian crisis in poverty-stricken Afghanistan. Aid agencies estimate that more than half of the Afghan population require some assistance, which is a significant factor in discouraging refugees from returning home. The Taliban’s sweeping restrictions on Afghan women’s access to employment, education, and public life at large, in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, have also deterred refugee families from leaving Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-sets-deadline-for-western-nations-to-relocate-afghan-allies/7960931.html	2025-02-03T05:54:34-08:00	
South Africa defends itself against Trump and Musk attacks on land policy	JOHANNESBURG — South Africa defended itself on Monday against attacks on its land confiscation policy by Donald Trump and his South African-born billionaire backer Elon Musk after the U.S. president said he would cut off funding to the country over the issue. Trump said on Sunday, without citing evidence, that 'South Africa is confiscating land' and 'certain classes of people' were being treated 'very badly.' 'I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!' he said. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government had not confiscated any land, and he looked forward to engaging with Trump to foster a better understanding over the matter. The United States committed nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, the most recent U.S. government data showed. The lion's share of the sum, $315 million, was for HIV/AIDS. Ramaphosa said U.S. funding accounted for 17% of South Africa's HIV/AIDS program but it was reliant on 'no other significant funding' from the United States. The president signed into law a bill last month to make it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, despite objections by some parties in his ruling coalition. The law aims to address stark racial disparities in land ownership that persist three decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. 'The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution,' the presidency said. The question of land reform is highly politically charged in South Africa due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras, when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights. Musk, the world's richest person and a South African-born U.S. citizen who has Trump's ear and more than 200 million followers on the X social media platform that he owns, quickly waded into the dispute. 'Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?' he said in a post on X, responding to Ramaphosa who had posted the presidency statement. He was apparently suggesting white people were the victims of the racism he alleged. Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya urged Musk to talk constructively with the South African president. 'My brother, you would know that owing to a devastating legacy of centuries of oppressive and brutal colonialism and apartheid, our constitution provides for redressing the ills of the past,' he said. Under the Expropriation Act, special conditions have to be met before expropriating land such as it having longtime informal occupants, being unused and held purely for speculation, or being abandoned. South Africa's rand fell nearly 2% against the dollar early on Monday after Trump's remarks. Stocks and the benchmark government bond also tumbled. Charles Robertson, an emerging markets specialist at FIM Partners, said that African countries were relatively well positioned to withstand an attack by Trump because the United States was a far less important investor than China and Europe. But any U.S. measures against South Africa would represent a serious challenge for Ramaphosa, who has been trying to boost the sluggish economy and attract foreign investors, he said. 'The difficulty with South Africa is, do you want to set up a factory in a country where today, Trump's cutting off all aid. Maybe tomorrow, he's ripping up AGOA (a trade deal with Africa) and maybe on Wednesday, he's adding 25% tariffs because they're too close to China,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-defends-itself-against-trump-and-musk-attacks-on-land-policy-/7960909.html	2025-02-03T05:43:55-08:00	
USAID staffers told to stay out of Washington headquarters after Musk said Trump agreed to close it	Washington — Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters on Monday, according to a notice distributed to them, after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency. USAID staffers said they also tracked more than 600 employees who reported being locked out of the agency's computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that 'at the direction of Agency leadership' the headquarters building 'will be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.' The developments come after Musk, who's leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with the Republican president's agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and 'he agreed we should shut it down.' 'It became apparent that its not an apple with a worm it in,' Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. 'What we have is just a ball of worms. You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair.' 'We're shutting it down,' he said. Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms, accusing it of promoting liberal causes. Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk's team accessing sensitive information. Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk's accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. 'It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we're getting them out,' Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night. Musk's and Trump's comments came with Secretary of State Marco Rubio out of the country, in Central America, on his first trip abroad in office. Rubio has not spoken publicly about any plans to shut down USAID. The Trump administration and Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID's aid programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency's leadership and staff in Washington.. Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump's first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors' badges asking questions of employees inside the Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a post on Sunday that Trump was allowing Musk to access people's personal information and shut down government funding. 'We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,' the Massachusetts senator said, without giving details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usaid-staffers-told-to-stay-out-of-washington-headquarters-after-musk-said-trump-agreed-to-close-it-/7960837.html	2025-02-03T05:11:48-08:00	
Facing tariff threats, India lowers import duties to signal it is not protectionist	New Delhi — With trade likely to emerge as the most contentious issue between India and the United States, New Delhi has signaled that it is moving to allay concerns of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has named India among countries that impose high tariffs. The government will cut duties on a range of imports that could help increase American imports to India. Those include high end motorcycles and cars potentially benefiting American companies like Harley Davidson. During an address to Republican lawmakers last week, Trump called India, along with China and Brazil, 'tremendous tariff makers.' and pledged to put tariffs on countries that harm U.S. interests. He also had called India a 'very big abuser of tariffs,' during his election campaign. In a phone call between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Monday, the American president had stressed the importance of India moving toward a 'fair bilateral trading relationship,' according to a White House statement. With the United States being India’s largest trading partner, the threat of tariffs is a huge concern for New Delhi. Bilateral trade between the two countries in 2023 totaled almost $120 billion, with a surplus of $30 billion in India’s favor. 'These latest reductions in tariffs signal a policy shift that could enhance U.S. exports in sectors such as automobiles, technology and some components for the space sector,' according to Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative, a think tank based in Delhi. 'However, U.S. is a small exporter of these items to India so the benefits to American companies may not be huge.' Trade is expected to be one of the top issues that will be discussed between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Trump, who are expected to meet this month. 'We don't want to give anybody any signal that we would like to be protectionist,' Finance Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told Reuters after the cut in duties was announced during India’s annual budget presentation on Saturday. 'Our stance is that we don't want to increase protection.' But analysts say India’s tariff cuts are unlikely to allay the concerns of the Trump administration, which wants New Delhi to open its markets for a range of goods such as farm products, steel and oil. India's average tariffs are much higher compared to countries like Japan and China. The close strategic partnership that India and the U.S. have built in recent years may not stave off friction on trade issues, say analysts. 'Lowering some tariffs is the symbolic approach. We have made some gestures but nowhere near what would satisfy Trump,' according to Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'On tariffs, I think the U.S. will put more pressure — after all, if Trump did not carve out exceptions for allies like Canada, why will he do it with India,' he questioned. In his last week’s phone conversation with Modi, Trump also said that India should be increasing its 'procurement of American-made security equipment.' India has been the world’s largest arms importer in recent years, spending billions of dollars to modernize its military. While Russia was its biggest supplier for decades, Western countries such as France and the United States are now emerging as key suppliers. 'There is scope for India to buy more weapons from the U.S. of which fighter jets could be a component,' according to defense analyst Rahul Bedi. 'That would help lower the trade tensions.' India is in 'wait and watch mode' after Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, say analysts. 'The global trade environment has been plunged into uncertainty. We will just have to wait and see what actions are taken by Mr. Trump vis a vis India,' pointed out trade expert Srivastava. 'India will adjust where it can, but it is totally uncharted territory and nobody can really plan for it.' Friction on trade also erupted during Trump’s previous term as president when he terminated India’s designation as a developing nation that had allowed businesses to export hundreds of products duty-free to the United States. India had retaliated by raising duties on some American products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facing-tariff-threats-india-lowers-import-duties-to-signal-it-is-not-protectionist-/7960808.html	2025-02-03T04:50:07-08:00	
Hospitals in eastern Congo are crowded with wounded and exhausting their supplies	GOMA, Congo — Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people. 'They will get infected before we can treat them all,' said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries. Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds. Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention. 'This is the first time I’m experiencing this,' said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. 'This war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.' The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, 1,600 kilometers away, describing the country as a failed state under President Félix Tshisekedi. The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is 'fully integrated' into the Congolese military, which denies the charges. Hospitals are running out of supplies Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds. 'We removed 48 bullets yesterday,' Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent. Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital. In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main city, Bukavu, 180 kilometers to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut. The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control. 'Goma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,' said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted. 'We’re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don’t know for how long,' Napolitano said. How many have died in the conflict? Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies. The Maternité de la Charité Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead. 'We had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,' said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director. 'We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,' he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored. Fears of disease spread as morgues overflow Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks. The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition. 'There’s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,' said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization’s representative in Congo. 'But at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hospitals-in-eastern-congo-are-crowded-with-wounded-and-exhausting-their-supplies-/7960758.html	2025-02-03T03:34:57-08:00	
WHO proposes budget cut after US exit, defends its work	London — World Health Organization member states will discuss cutting part of its budget by $400 million in light of President Trump's move to withdraw the United States, its biggest government funder, from the agency, a document released on Monday showed. Opening the agency's annual executive board meeting, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also defended the agency's work and recent reforms and reiterated a call for the U.S. to reconsider its exit and enter into dialog with the WHO about further change. 'We would welcome suggestions from the United States, and all member states, for how we can serve you and the people of the world better,' he said. The budget cut will be discussed at the Feb. 3-11 Geneva meeting, during which member state representatives will discuss the agency's funding and work for the 2026-2027 period. The executive board proposes cutting the base programs section of the budget from a proposed $5.3 billion to $4.9 billion, according to a document released on Monday. That is part of the wider $7.5 billion budget for 2026-2027 that was originally proposed, including money for polio eradication and tackling emergencies. 'With the departure of the biggest financial contributor, the budget could not be 'business as usual,'' the document reads. The U.S. is the WHO's biggest government donor, contributing around 18% of its overall funding. The WHO has already separately taken some cost-cutting steps after the U.S. move. However, some board representatives also wanted to send a message that the WHO would preserve its strategic direction despite the challenges, the document adds. The $4.9 billion is roughly the same as the base program budget for the previous period, 2024-2025. Trump moved to exit the WHO on his first day in office two weeks ago. The process will take one year under U.S. law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-proposes-budget-cut-after-us-exit-defends-its-work/7960730.html	2025-02-03T02:58:39-08:00	
Pope Francis decries deaths of children in global conflicts	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday decried the deaths of children in global conflicts, telling a Vatican summit that 'nothing is worth the life of a child.' Francis, who has been critical of both Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the ongoing violence of the Russia-Ukraine war, did not specify a conflict in his remarks. 'What we have tragically seen almost every day in recent times, namely children dying beneath bombs ... is unacceptable,' said the pontiff. 'To kill children is to deny the future.' The Vatican, shaken in recent decades by child sexual abuse scandals in countries across the world, invited a range of global leaders on Monday for a one-day conference to discuss children's rights. Queen Rania of Jordan, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, and former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri were among the speakers. Francis ramped up his criticism of Israel's military campaign in Gaza in recent months, before the January ceasefire agreement. A few weeks ago, he called the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave 'very serious and shameful.' In Monday's speech, he also decried the number of children displaced by global conflicts, which the United Nations estimates at some 38 million. 'We are here today to say that we do not want this to become the new normal,' said the pope. 'We refuse to get used to it.' Francis, who has been sharply critical of U.S. President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration, also mentioned undocumented children at the U.S.-Mexico border. He said they were the 'first victims of that exodus of despair and hope made by the thousands of people coming from the South towards the United States of America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-decries-deaths-of-children-in-global-conflicts/7960712.html	2025-02-03T02:36:02-08:00	
At least 15 killed in car bomb explosion in northern Syria	DAMASCUS, Syria — At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded Monday when a car bomb exploded on the outskirts of a northern Syrian city, local civil defense and a war monitor reported. The car on the outskirts of the city of Manbij detonated next to a vehicle carrying agricultural workers, killing 14 women and one man, the local Syrian civil defense reported. Another 15 women were wounded, some of them in critical condition. However, Britain-based war monitor The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 18 women were killed as well as one man. It was the seventh car bomb explosion in Manbij in just over a month, said Munir Mustafa, the deputy director of civil defense, known as The White Helmets. He warned that the ongoing attacks in Aleppo province near Syria's second city will halt Syria's progress to bring about post-war security and economic recovery. 'The continued attacks on Syrian civilian areas and targeting civilians while they are trying to recover from the effects of the war of the defunct Assad regime that lasted for about 14 years threatens their lives, deepens their humanitarian tragedy, undermines educational and agricultural activities and livelihoods, and worsens the humanitarian situation in Syria,' Mustafa said. Manbij in northeastern Aleppo province continues to witness violence even after the downfall of President Bashar Assad in December, where Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army continue to clash with the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. A car bombing in Manbij on Saturday killed four civilians and wounded nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-15-killed-in-car-bomb-explosion-in-northern-syria-/7960711.html	2025-02-03T02:34:31-08:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy sites	Russian officials said Monday that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted energy facilities in two regions in southwestern Russia. Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov said falling debris from drones destroyed by Russian air defenses sparked fires at an oil refinery. Astrakhan Governor Igor Babushkin said the Ukrainian attacks focused on fuel and energy facilities, starting a fire in his region but causing no casualties. The officials did not give details about the sites involved in the attacks. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 71 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the attacks damaged three houses and an agricultural business. Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 38 of the 71 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zaporizhzhia regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged four residential buildings. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported the Russian attack damaged a school. Some information for this story was provided by Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-ukrainian-drone-attacks-targeted-energy-sites/7960672.html	2025-02-03T00:23:53-08:00	
EU leaders to huddle on defense against Russia, economy, and US	BRUSSELS — European Union leaders gather on Monday to discuss how to bolster the continent's defenses against Russia and how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump after his decision to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China. At a royal palace-turned-conference center in Brussels, the leaders of the EU's 27 nations will also lunch with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and dine with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Antonio Costa, the president of the European Council of EU leaders, has billed the one-day gathering as a 'retreat' devoted to defense policy rather than a formal summit, aiming for an open discussion without any official declaration or decisions. The first session focuses on geopolitics and relations with the United States, meaning Trump's sweeping weekend move on tariffs is certain to come up – particularly as EU officials fear they may soon face similar measures. Trump, who began his second term as president on Jan. 20, will also be a major factor in the talks on defense, as he has demanded that European nations spend much more on their own protection and rely less on the United States via the NATO security alliance. Trump's call for EU member Denmark to cede Greenland to the United States - and his refusal to rule out military action or economic pressure to force Copenhagen's hand - has also added strains to trans-Atlantic ties. The EU leaders are expected to discuss what military capabilities they need in the coming years, how they could be funded and how they might cooperate more through joint projects. 'Europe needs to assume greater responsibility for its own defense,' Costa said in a letter to the leaders. 'It needs to become more resilient, more efficient, more autonomous and a more reliable security and defense actor.' Finding funding The funding discussion will be especially tough, according to diplomats, as many European countries have little room in their public finances for big spending hikes. Some countries, such as the Baltic states and France, advocate joint EU borrowing to spend on defense. But Germany and the Netherlands are staunchly opposed. One compromise could be to borrow to finance loans rather than grants for defense projects, according to some diplomats. European countries have ramped up defense spending in recent years, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which brought war to the EU's borders. But many EU leaders have said they will need to spend even more. Trump has said NATO's European members should spend 5% of GDP on defense - a figure no member of the alliance including the United States currently reaches. Last year, EU countries spent an average of 1.9% of GDP on defense - about $334.48 billion, according to EU estimates. That is a 30% increase from 2021, according to the EU. But it also masks wide divergences among EU countries. Poland and the Baltic states are among the biggest defense spenders in GDP terms, with Warsaw leading the pack at more than 4.1%, according to NATO estimates. But some of the EU's biggest economies such as Italy and Spain spend much less - about 1.5% and 1.3% respectively.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-leaders-to-huddle-on-defense-against-russia-economy-and-us/7960644.html	2025-02-02T22:43:36-08:00	
Netanyahu to meet with US Middle East envoy to open US visit	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Monday with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff during a visit to Washington focused on Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas and other regional issues. Netanyahu’s office said he and Witkoff would discuss Israel’s ceasefire positions. The talks come as negotiations are expected to open this week on the second phase of the ceasefire, with the two sides needing to agree on matter such as the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas and an end to the conflict that began in October 2023. Witkoff is due to follow his Netanyahu talks by speaking with officials from Egypt and Qatar, the other two nations that have led the ceasefire negotiations. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump, and said those talks would include the war against Hamas, countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries. Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. During the first phase of the ceasefire, which lasts six weeks, Hamas has freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in early March. It's not clear where Trump stands. Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' shock Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both living and dead. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin, to the town of Tamun. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

Trump to speak with Canadian, Mexican leaders after imposing new tariffs	U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to speak Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, days after announcing tariffs on goods from those countries and China that have were met with pledges of retaliatory tariffs and other actions. The new tariffs affect the top three U.S. trading partners, but Trump said the move would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. Despite a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the closest U.S. allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 'Why? There is no reason,' Trump contended. 'We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.' 'Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Trump said. He said, 'Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!' With the new tariffs, Trump said, 'Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!) But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.' Trump aides had previously shied from acknowledging that tariffs could raise U.S. consumer prices. Nationwide polls in the U.S. showed that consumer frustration over rising prices during the last four years were a major factor in his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris. Trump has since acknowledged that it will not be easy to curb higher grocery prices. Trump put the new tariff on energy imports from Canada at 10%, apparently seeking to limit an increase in fuel and electricity prices. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that his country would hit back with 25% percent levies of its own on select American goods worth $106.6 billion, with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks. Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of U.S. liquor purchases, and more specifically, orange juice produced in the U.S. state of Florida, whiskey in Tennessee and peanut butter in Kentucky, three states Trump won in last November’s election and all represented by Republicans, like Trump, in the U.S. Senate. Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., told ABC’s 'This Week' show, 'We’re really disappointed' and 'perplexed' by Trump’s actions and said she hoped that Trump would back off before Tuesday. But she acknowledged that 'it’s really in the president’s hands' whether that happens. She said that 'less than 1% of illegal immigrants' entering the U.S. travel across its northern border with Canada. She said Canada has invested 'in a lot of equipment' to curb unauthorized border crossings and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. to catch migrants. 'It’s hard to know what more we could do,' she said. 'We’re not at all interested in escalating' a trade war with the U.S., where she said 99% of the trade is currently tariff-free. 'We’re eager to build on that.' Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had directed her economy minister to 'implement Plan B,' which includes yet-unspecified 'tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,' without specifying what U.S. goods her government will target. U.S. exports to Mexico totaled more than $322 billion in 2023, Census Bureau data showed, while the U.S. imported more than $475 billion worth of Mexican products. Sheinbaum assailed Trump’s contention that her government had joined forces with drug cartels, a claim he made in announcing the tariff increases. 'We categorically reject the White House’s slanderous claim that the Mexico government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempt to intervene in our territory,' Sheinbaum wrote on X. 'If there is anywhere that such an alliance in fact exists, it is in the United States gun factories that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups.' China denounced the new tariffs on its exports, with Beijing saying it would challenge them at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified 'countermeasures.' The U.S. had a $279 billion trade deficit with China in 2023, the largest figure for any of its trading partners. That response stopped short of the immediate escalation that had marked China’s trade showdown with Trump during his first term as president. China’s commerce ministry said in a statement that Trump’s move 'seriously violates' international trade rules, urging the U.S. to 'engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.' Trump also has often threatened new tariffs against the European Union. A spokesperson for the bloc said Sunday that it would 'respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs.'

Asian markets slump after Trump announces tariffs	Stock markets in Asia fell Monday amid investor concerns about new tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would levy on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. Japan’s Nikkei index was down 2.4% at its midday break, while South Korea’s KOSPI index was trading down 3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down more than 2% in early trading before cutting its loses to 1.4% around midday. U.S. stock futures were down ahead of those markets opening Monday. Trump on Saturday announced the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods. Canada and Mexico have announced their own tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump’s move. China has pledged to take unspecified measures in its response. China, Mexico and Canada are the top three U.S. trade partners.

Rising floodwaters force evacuations in eastern Australia	SYDNEY — Fast-moving floodwaters rose Monday in northeastern Australia after forcing many to flee, blacking out homes, and sweeping away a chunk of a critical bridge. Storms have already dumped more than a meter of rain in two days in parts of Queensland, engulfing homes, businesses and roads in muddy waters, authorities said. Aerial footage showed rural communities surrounded by the floodwaters, cut off from nearby roads. 'We are going to see widespread rain and storms spread across much of northern Queensland,' the state's premier, David Crisafulli, warned in a news conference. 'We remain prepared for the ongoing prospect of more rain and the likelihood of more flooding, both flash flooding and riverine flooding,' he said. Emergency services carried out 11 'swift water rescues' overnight, the premier said. Areas of flood-hit Townsville, a popular coastal tourist destination that lies near the Great Barrier Reef, had been declared a 'black zone,' he said. 'Our advice to residents in the black zone at the moment is to stay out of that zone and stay safe.' The authorities told 2,100 people in the town to evacuate at the weekend, though about 10% refused, emergency services officials said. 'Bridge torn in two' One woman in her 60s was killed Sunday when the rescue boat she was in flipped over in the flood-hit rural town of Ingham, about 100 kilometers from Townsville, police said. Her body was recovered later. The floods swept away a section of a concrete bridge over a creek, cutting off the state's main coastal road, the Bruce Highway, the state premier said. 'It's not every day you see a bridge torn in two. That's what has happened at Ollera Creek, and it is significant,' Crisafulli said. Almost 11,000 properties remained without power across north Queensland, Ergon Energy said, with no timeframe given for when electricity will be restored. Townsville acting mayor Ann-Maree Greaney said the floods were expected to peak on Tuesday morning. 'The roads at the moment are cut off, so communities are isolated,' she told AFP. The town was pressing for power to be restored and working with major supermarkets to deliver food, the mayor said. As global temperatures rise because of climate change, scientists have warned that heatwaves and other extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, droughts and wildfires will become more frequent and more intense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-floodwaters-force-evacuations-in-eastern-australia-/7960622.html	2025-02-02T20:10:34-08:00	
Chappell Roan wins best new artist at the Grammys	LOS ANGELES — Chappell Roan was named best new artist at the 2025 Grammys. She read a speech from a notebook, beginning by addressing her fellow nominees. 'BRAT was the best night of my life this year,' she said, as her hat fell off her head, referencing Charli xcx. Then her speech changed course. She directed her attention to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to 'offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.' Then she described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like 'valuable employees.' 'Labels, we got you, but do you got us?' she concluded her speech. 'Thank you.' In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album at the 2025 Grammys to Beyoncé for her groundbreaking 'Cowboy Carter.' 'I really was not expecting this. Wow,' she started her speech. 'Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists ... I'm still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor.' A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Chappell Roan brought a rocking version of her 'Pink Pony Club' to the 2025 Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse. The Grammys are airing live on CBS and Paramount+. Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers can also watch live and on demand. The first televised award of the 2025 Grammy Awards went to Doechii for best rap album for 'Alligator Bites Never Heal.' The tears were immediate. 'This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill —' she said, correcting herself. 'Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii.' It was Doechii's first Grammy. Her heartfelt speech came after the show opened with several references to the Los Angeles-area wildfires that have devastated the city but put the spotlight on the city's resiliency. The Grammys kicked off Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in high spirits, drawing attention to first responders and the resilience of the music community. Host Trevor Noah's opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates 'the city that brought us so much of that music.' The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires. On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brother/collaborator Finneas performed her hit 'Birds of a Feather.' It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. 'We love you LA,' she told the crowd at the end of the set. The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newman's 'I Love L.A.' by Dawes — whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire — backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Later, Sabrina Carpenter launched into a medley of her biggest singles of the last year — a jazzy rendition of 'Espresso' into 'Please, Please, Please,' with a brief 'Espresso' reprise. Most of the best new artist nominees took part in a medley performance: Khruangbin with 'May Ninth,' Benson Boone with 'Beautiful Things,' Doechii launching 'Catfish' into 'Denial Is a River,' Teddy Swims doing 'Lose Control,' Shaboozey with 'Good News' into 'A Bar Song (Tipsy)' and RAYE with 'Oscar Winning Tears.' The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit 'Under the Bridge,' reminding the crowd to 'support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives,' said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for 'Short n' Sweet.' 'I really wasn’t expecting this,' she said. 'This is, woo, my first Grammy so I’m going to cry.' (She’s now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists don’t attend.) First time winners were abundant An exciting, early theme of the 67th Grammy Awards? First time winners. During Sunday’s Premiere Ceremony, a pre-telecast show hosted by songwriter Justin Tranter, some of the biggest names in pop like Carpenter and Charli xcx won their first Grammys, as did Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell. They weren’t the only ones: Veterans took home trophies, as did former President Jimmy Carter. He won a posthumous Grammy Award for narrating 'Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,' recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. It was his fourth Grammy win. Soon afterward, Charli xcx also won her first two Grammys, in the best pop dance recording category for 'Von Dutch' and best dance/electronic album for 'BRAT.' Amy Allen won the songwriter of the year, non-classical, a Grammy category that has only existed for three years. She is the first woman to ever win. Tobias Jesso Jr. won in 2023 and Theron Thomas won in 2024. 'The child in me ... is screaming and crying and laughing at the absurdity of this moment,' Allen started her speech. 'We are the engine that fuels the entire music industry,' she said of songwriters past and present. Ferrell won her first Grammys for Americana performance, Americana roots song, Americana album, and American roots performance. She pulled an acceptance speech out of scepter.

Trial of Spain's ex-football chief over forced kiss to begin	MADRID — Spain's former football chief Luis Rubiales goes on trial on Monday over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso with the player scheduled to take the stand. The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia. Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident. The kiss was given 'unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player,' prosecutors wrote in their indictment. 'Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will,' it added. The highly anticipated trial gets underway at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid at 10 a.m. and is expected to run until Feb. 19. Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on Feb. 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous 'peck between friends celebrating' and denied any coercion. Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque. They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. Historic success overshadowed The scandal that rocked Spanish football and wrecked Rubiales' career broke on Aug. 20, 2023, moments after the women's national team had clinched World Cup glory in Sydney. As Hermoso joined her teammates in collecting their winner's medals, Rubiales clasped her head and kissed her on the lips before letting her go with two slaps on the back. The act unleashed a public outcry at what critics deemed an abuse of power. A recent reform of the Spanish criminal code classifies a non-consensual kiss as sexual assault. Rubiales, who was already under investigation for alleged corruption in his role as federation head, finally gave into pressure and stepped down in September 2023, two days after the start of a probe over the kiss. He had been federation chief since 2018. In a recent Netflix documentary titled 'Se acabo' ('It's over'), which looks back at the players' anger after the scandal overshadowed their historic success, Hermoso revealed she cried following the kiss. Hermoso, the all-time top scorer for the national women's team who now plays in Mexico, said in the documentary that the federation demanded she appear in a video where she would claim Rubiales' kiss 'was nothing, it was... joy, euphoria.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-of-spain-s-ex-football-chief-over-forced-kiss-to-begin-/7960597.html	2025-02-02T18:46:40-08:00	
Georgian police arrest opposition leaders at pro-EU protest	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia arrested several anti-government protesters on Sunday as thousands of demonstrators demanding new parliamentary elections briefly blocked a motorway on the edge of the capital Tbilisi. A Reuters reporter saw three protesters being arrested, including Nika Melia, a leader of the country's largest opposition party, the Coalition for Change. Interfax news agency reported that Melia has since been released on bail after detention for an administrative offense. 'At the police station, I was sitting on a chair in handcuffs and was kicked by a police officer,' Interfax cited Melia as telling journalists afterwards. Reuters could not independently verify the information. There was no immediate comment from the police. Georgia's Ministry Of Internal Affairs had said in a statement before the protest that the police would ensure the rally took place 'in a peaceful environment, within the limits established by law.' Former Tbilisi Mayor Giorgi Ugulava was also arrested, local media reported. Late Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas blasted the arrests. 'The brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters, journalists and politicians tonight in Tbilisi is unacceptable,' Kallas wrote on X. 'Georgia falls short of any expectation from a candidate country. The EU stands with the people of Georgia in their fight for freedom and democracy.' Georgians have been rallying nightly since November, when the ruling Georgian Dream party said it was suspending European Union accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a long-standing national goal. Georgian Dream held onto power in a disputed election in October that opposition parties say was rigged. The government says the vote was fair and free. Protests had dwindled in recent weeks but they resumed with greater force on Sunday when thousands of people gathered outside a shopping complex on the northern edge of Tbilisi and briefly blocked the road leading out of the city. Police presence at the rally was considerable. Earlier on Sunday, the Interior Ministry warned protesters in a statement that blocking the motorway was a criminal offense. One protester was seen by the side of the road, unconscious. Reuters was unable to establish what had happened to him. Unverified video footage posted on social media showed scores of police in balaclavas beating protesters on the streets and others carrying away injured demonstrators into ambulances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-police-arrest-opposition-leaders-at-pro-eu-protest/7960596.html	2025-02-02T18:45:07-08:00	
FBI staff ordered to reveal their roles in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probes by Monday	Washington — FBI employees were ordered Sunday to answer a detailed list of questions about any work they may have done on criminal cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, stoking fear among staff about a fresh round of firings at the law enforcement agency. 'I know myself and others receiving this questionnaire have a lot of questions and concerns, which I am working hard to get answers to,' Chad Yarbrough, the assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division at FBI headquarters, wrote in a weekend email seen by Reuters. The list of questions in the memo, seen by Reuters, direct employees to give their job title, any role they played in the Jan. 6 investigations and whether they helped supervise such investigations. Yarbrough told employees the answers are due by 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Monday Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove on Friday fired eight senior FBI officials from agency headquarters as well as the heads of the Miami and Washington, D.C., field offices. Another memo written by Bove on Friday also demanded that the FBI by Tuesday at noon ET (1700 GMT) turn over to him a list of every employee who worked on Jan. 6 cases, as well as a list of those who worked on a criminal case filed last year against leaders of the militant Hamas group in connection with the Gaza war. Bove last week fired more than a dozen career Justice Department prosecutors who worked on the two now-dismissed criminal cases brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith against Trump, one involving actions taken to try to overturn the 2020 election results and the other involving classified government documents. A FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the questionnaire. Democrats and other critics have said Trump's team is carrying out a purge of FBI and Justice Department officials who played roles in the criminal cases against Trump and the Jan. 6 rioters. On Trump's first day back in office on Jan. 20, he commuted the sentences of 14 people in connection with the Capitol attack and pardoned the rest — including those who violently attacked law enforcement officers. Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, in an email Friday to staff announcing details about the order from Bove, said the request 'encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts.' 'I am one of those employees, as is acting Deputy Director [Robert] Kissane,' Driscoll noted. Despite reports about other firings throughout the bureau, emails seen by Reuters from both the FBI Agents Association and from James Dennehy, the assistant FBI director in charge of the New York office, made it clear that no one else had been asked to resign. Nevertheless, some employees started to clear out their desks Friday amid concerns they might be next, according to the FBI Agents Association email seen by Reuters. 'Today, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own, as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy,' Dennehy wrote Friday, saying he gave credit to Driscoll and Kissane for 'fighting for this organization.' Dennehy added that other than the select group of people named in Bove's memo, 'NO ONE has been told they are being removed at this time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-staff-ordered-to-reveal-their-roles-in-jan-6-capitol-riot-probes-by-monday/7960564.html	2025-02-02T16:30:42-08:00	
Late President Jimmy Carter wins posthumous Grammy	Los Angeles — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous Grammy award. Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for 'Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,' recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on the record. It’s Carter's fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three previous ones for spoken word album. If the former president won before his death, he would've become the oldest Grammy award winner in history. Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, received the award on his behalf. 'Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the world is truly remarkable,' he said in an acceptance speech. 'Thank you to the academy.' In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer Guy Oldfield. If Streisand had won instead of Carter, it would have been her first Grammy win in 38 years. Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop Perkins in 2011.	https://www.voanews.com/a/late-president-jimmy-carter-wins-posthumous-grammy/7960556.html	2025-02-02T16:09:25-08:00	
Amid Los Angeles wildfires clean-up, residents furious over hazardous waste	Duarte, California — Not far from where Ceci Carroll lives, a rock-mining company has polluted the air with dust across the San Gabriel Valley, she said. Now, as crews clean charred remains from the Los Angeles wildfires, she worries about a new potential source of contamination: a site to process hazardous debris from the Eaton Fire. 'I’m concerned about the community and also the school districts here, where we have children,' said Carroll, a Duarte resident of 23 years and former local school board member. 'We’re dealing with the site with the chemicals and hazardous materials,' she said. 'Parents are absolutely concerned.' Carroll is among residents from Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities opposing the Environmental Protection Agency's use of Lario Park in Irwindale as a temporary site to separate, package and transport potentially hazardous materials from the Eaton Fire. In ordinary times, people picnic, bike or ride horses on equestrian trails in the federally owned land. They now worry about dangerous waste that could pollute the air or seep into groundwater. The blazes that began on Jan. 7 charred thousands of buildings, cars and electronics across the Los Angeles area. The EPA has begun the enormous task of removing potentially hundreds of tons of hazardous materials from the Eaton and Palisades fires. That includes paints, pesticides, solvents, compressed gas cylinders, ammunition and lithium-ion batteries from electric cars that could turn toxic when burned. 'The removal of these materials should not come at the cost of creating a toxic environment for communities already disproportionately impacted by pollution,' Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said in a statement. The mostly Latino communities adjacent to the site are exposed to higher levels of ozone and particulate matter pollution than other areas, according to data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Experts acknowledge residents' concerns, but say hazardous waste is not necessarily harmful as long as safety measures are in place and the waste is not stored on site for years. Residents have questions about waste site At a town hall Wednesday, California Sen. Susan Rubio and local mayors opposing the site grilled state and federal officials: How was the site chosen? Why weren't we consulted or notified? Why truck toxic waste 24 kilometers from the burn zone and risk contaminating our communities? What testing will be done after it's closed? Hundreds of residents crammed into the performing arts center and spilled into the hall. They shouted 'Shut it down!' and chanted 'Leave it in Altadena!' EPA coordinator Tara Fitzgerald told the audience that sites closer to the Eaton burn zone were being used for emergency fire operations, including the Rose Bowl and the Santa Anita Park in Pasadena. They chose the Lario Park site because it suited their needs and was available. She emphasized that the EPA has done this work for years across the state. 'We did the exact same thing' for the Woolsey, Santa Rosa and Napa fires, Fitzgerald said, and 'we did not have any impacts to the community during the entire process.' But the Eaton and Palisades fires are unprecedented. Together, they torched the largest urban area on record in California, according to an Associated Press analysis, and more than double the urban acreage consumed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. EPA says protective measures being taken The EPA said it would regularly monitor air, sample soil, use water trucks to control dust and transport waste out of the area daily. The agency lines areas with plastic where materials are processed and uses wattles, earthen berms and other items to control spills. The waste will be transported on surface streets, not freeways, so trucks can travel at a slower and safer speed, the EPA’s Celeste McCoy told the county Board of Supervisors. She said the site would likely be used less than six months, and more areas are being considered. With these protective measures, the risks of groundwater contamination, which takes a long time, are low, said Sanjay Mohanty, a UCLA associate professor who has studied wildfire effects on water and soil. 'There’s several feet of soil that the pollutant has to pass through, and that also requires lots of water to leech from the system,' Mohanty said. 'And even if there is leeching, they would not migrate far into the soil in a short time. ' The bigger risks are soil and air pollution from possible dust emissions, he added, but those too can be mitigated. Residents should stay vigilant Duarte resident Laura Jasso did not leave the meeting reassured and remained upset about the lack of transparency from state and federal officials. 'It’s hard to have confidence when they’ve really done this behind our backs,' she said. While crews continue their work, residents should be vigilant to what is happening at the site and ask how materials are being handled, about emergency response plans and truck routes and schedules, said Rachael Jones, professor and director of the UCLA Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. 'The community has the right to know that information from the EPA and the Army Corps,' Jones said. Jasso said her community is committed to holding the EPA accountable for ensuring safety. 'Ultimately, we don’t want it here, and we’re going to continue to fight to not have it here,' she said of the site. 'But the fact is, it’s here right now. And so, we have to just acknowledge the safety of our students, the concerns of our families.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-los-angeles-wildfires-clean-up-residents-furious-over-hazardous-waste/7960319.html	2025-02-02T15:52:16-08:00	
Gerber recalls baby teething sticks over possible choking hazard	Arlington, Virginia — A baby food maker is recalling edible sticks meant to ease teething pain over a possible choking hazard. Gerber announced Friday that it was recalling and discontinuing its brand of 'Sooth N Chew' teething sticks after receiving customer complaints about choking. The company said one emergency room visit had been reported. The teething sticks are edible teethers marketed to parents and guardians of children six months and older. They come in strawberry-apple and banana flavors. Gerber said it was working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the recall. Customers who bought the teething sticks should return them to stores where they were purchased for a refund, the company said. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a health care provider. For any additional support needed, Gerber is available 24/7 at 1-800-4-GERBER (1-800-443-7237). The company says it is working with the U.S. FDA on this recall and will cooperate with them fully.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gerber-recalls-baby-teething-sticks-over-possible-choking-hazard/7960318.html	2025-02-02T15:41:25-08:00	
Uganda set to begin Ebola vaccine trial after new outbreak kills nurse	Kampala, Uganda — Ugandan officials are preparing to deploy a trial vaccine as part of efforts to stem an outbreak of Ebola in the capital, Kampala, a top health official said Sunday. A range of scientists are developing research protocols relating to the planned deployment of more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola, said Pontiano Kaleebu, executive director of Uganda Virus Research Institute. 'Protocol is being accelerated' to get all the necessary regulatory approvals, he said. 'This vaccine is not yet licensed.' The World Health Organization said in a statement that its support to Uganda's response to the outbreak includes access to 2,160 doses of trial vaccine. 'Research teams have been deployed to the field to work along with the surveillance teams as approvals are awaited,' the WHO statement said. The candidate vaccine as well as candidate treatments are being made available through clinical trial protocols to further test for efficacy and safety, it said. The vaccine maker wasn't immediately known. There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola that killed a nurse employed at Kampala's main referral hospital. The man died on Wednesday and authorities declared an outbreak the next day. Officials are still investigating the source of the outbreak, and there has been no other confirmed case. Uganda has had access to candidate vaccine doses since the end of an Ebola outbreak in September 2022 that killed at least 55 people. Ugandan officials ran out of time to begin a vaccine study when that outbreak, in central Uganda, was declared over about four months later, Kaleebu said. A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there. Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, the disease's largest death toll. Tracing contacts is also key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever. At least 44 contacts of the victim in the current outbreak have been identified, including 30 health workers and patients, according to Uganda's Ministry of Health. Confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease earlier this month, while in December Rwanda announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over. The ongoing Marburg outbreak in northern Tanzania's Kagera region has killed at least two people, according to local health authorities. Kampala's outbreak could prove difficult to respond to, because the city has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside Kampala and later traveled to Mbale, in the country's east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said the man also sought the services of a traditional healer. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding. Scientists don't know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-set-to-begin-ebola-vaccine-trial-after-new-outbreak-kills-nurse/7960315.html	2025-02-02T15:29:33-08:00	
New Orleans Super Bowl gets beefed up security measures	New Orleans, Louisiana — After a New Year's Day attack struck at the heart of the French Quarter, officials in New Orleans say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for the Super Bowl. Upwards of 125,000 visitors are expected to converge on the Big Easy beginning Feb. 5 for parties, concerts and revelry featuring artists including Post Malone and Diplo and capped off by the Feb. 9 clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome stadium to crown this season's NFL champion. Following the truck-ramming attack early on Jan. 1 that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations they are ready to play host. 'We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve hosted previously,' Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. 'We know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.' What will the security presence look like? Thousands of state, federal and local law enforcement officers will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier said. But she and city officials remained tight-lipped about details. Drones will be prohibited around the Superdome and downtown New Orleans throughout the week of the game and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration. Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said the Homeland Security Department's Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of Super Bowl security. Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and BearCat armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium and across the city's historic French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said. No one will be allowed inside the cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium, where the perimeter will include blast barriers requiring trucks to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said. Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are engaging in a days-long effort to scour the 37,161 square meters (400,000 square feet) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said. 'They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,' DeLaune said. How the New Year's Day attack has changed security plans Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police. The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic, which was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack, remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said. Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks. The NFL and federal and city agencies have 'put a fresh set of eyes' on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo. 'No specific or credible threats' have surfaced targeting the Super Bowl, NFL security chief Lanier said Wednesday. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced the creation of an 'enhanced security zone' along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 national guardsmen. After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering Bourbon Street zone during the Super Bowl weekend. But in accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street, Louisiana State Police Sgt. Katharine Stegall said, noting they remained banned from bars. AI and mobile apps will play security role The Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time. The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said. 'It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,' Crowley said. 'The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-super-bowl-gets-beefed-up-security-measures/7960311.html	2025-02-02T15:19:23-08:00

55 of 67 victims of air disaster near Washington recovered and identified, officials say	Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the 67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001. Washington, DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning. 'Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,' said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers. Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation. They spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site just outside Washington, DC, walking along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones. Dozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry. But he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs. 'What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?' Duffy asked on CNN. The American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding. The plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip. Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter. The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter. Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash. Data from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 99 meters, plus or minus 7.6 meters, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk 61 meters, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area. The discrepancy has yet to be explained. Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable. 'That’s what our job is, to figure that out,' NTSB member Todd Inman said. 'This is a complex investigation,' investigator in charge Brice Banning said. 'There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.' Banning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash. 'The crew had a verbal reaction,' Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed 'the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.' Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said. 'Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,' Inman said. 'They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.' More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage. On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower. Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training. According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called 'not normal.' 'Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,' Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with 'bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.' With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground. Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed. 'It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump wrote on Truth Social. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground. Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/of-67-victims-of-air-disaster-near-washington-recovered-and-identified-officials-say/7960299.html	2025-02-02T14:28:04-08:00	
DR Congo: Near Goma, displaced people begin long journey home	GOMA, DRC — Once crowded with white makeshift huts, the huge Kanyaruchinya camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Goma, in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, looked eerily empty Sunday. Since Goma was taken by M23 fighters earlier this week, some 100,000 internally displaced people have left the jam-packed hillside where they had set up several years ago. The ongoing crisis in the eastern DRC continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government, and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the U.N. and the U.S. classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. The M23 offensive in the mineral-rich eastern DRC is the latest to scar a region that has seen relentless conflict involving dozens of armed groups kill an estimated 6 million people over three decades. 'Life in the camp is a life of suffering and hunger,' said Christine Bwiza, one of the last people to leave camp Kanyaruchinya, which sits near the Rwandan border. There, residents had cobbled together makeshift huts from sticks and tarpaulin. Hunger was rampant and poor hygiene regularly caused cholera outbreaks. Many had mixed feelings about finally going home. Some said they were relieved, others stressed they had no choice. All worried about their future. On the side of the road, a convoy of overcrowded trucks picked up some of the last contingents of travelers. 'I was a displaced person who came with nothing. And today I'm going home just as I came,' said Denise Zaninga, seated at the back of a vehicle, adding that she had no idea where she was headed. 'I am leaving but I don't know where I'm going to live,' she said. Others shared her anxiety. 'Our homes are destroyed, our children are lost because of the war, and we are returning home hungry,' said Bwiza. For Aline Irafasha, 'hunger will kill us wherever we go, but it's better to suffer at home.' The driver of the truck they had boarded said the M23 had paid for the vehicle and financed the trip. Since M23 fighters and Rwandan troops have taken control of the city, the nearby front line has disappeared. Surrounding territories are now accessible by road, bordered by abandoned military posts and charred armored vehicles. Under pressure The M23 has vowed to send displaced people back to where they came from, and their violent takeover of Goma meant people in the camp had little choice but to leave. The overall population in Goma, a city of 1 million people, has nearly doubled in the past 30 years, swollen by victims fleeing violence. At the camp, now a deserted, littered field, some said they had been pressured into leaving, but most preferred to go home before being forced to. This sudden exodus sits well with locals whose farmlands were invaded and occupied for years. 'Here we used to have fields,' said Elizabeth Base Sembimbi, pointing to a plot of land in ruins in front of her plank house. 'But we had to stop harvesting because of the robberies,' she said, adding that she was looking forward to farming again. On the side of the road, armed men, apparently from the Rwandan army, patrolled the street on foot. One resident said that at nightfall, armed men had broken into people's homes looking for weapons and forcing young people to carry food and water over long distances without paying them. 'People are starting to feel scared,' he said. 'We can't say anything, we keep our mouths shut and observe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-near-goma-displaced-people-begin-long-journey-home/7960287.html	2025-02-02T14:03:29-08:00	
Italian who saved children from WWII massacre dies aged 96	Rome — Milena Bernabo, awarded one of Italy's top civilian honors for saving three children from the Nazis during World War II, died Sunday aged 96, local authorities said. Bernabo was awarded the gold medal for civil merit for saving her young neighbors during the August 1944 massacre of Sant'Anna di Stazzema, in Tuscany, in which 560 people died. Then aged 16, Bernabo had been led together with fellow villagers into an outhouse and targeted by German machine gun fire. Bernabo was wounded, according to the citation. But she managed to escape with Mario, five, and 10-year-olds Mauro and Lina, from the building as it was set on fire. The trio she saved were present to see Bernabo receive the valor award at a ceremony in the central city of Lucca in 2005. Officials at the time hailed her bravery as an example of many Italians' 'silent resistance' to Nazi occupation during the latter part of World War II. 'Throughout her life she was an ambassador of peace, reminding the young people she encountered of the Nazi-Fascist massacre of Sant’Anna di Stazzema,' the office of the mayor of Stazzema, Maurizio Verona, told AFP in an emai 'Milena remembered with the hope that those who listened would understand that Fascism and Nazism were absolute evils of the last century and that the institutions and their representatives would work to build a better future.' Two other women from Sant'Anna were awarded the same honor -- Cesira Pardini, who died in 2022, and Genny Bibolotti Marsili, who died the day of the massacre. They were all 'heroines,' Mayor Verona told the ANSA news agency, hailing Bernabo's strength and determination to keep the memory of what happened alive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-who-saved-children-from-wwii-massacre-dies-aged-96/7960281.html	2025-02-02T13:27:46-08:00	
USAID security leaders on leave after trying to keep Musk's inspectors from classified info	Washington — The Trump administration has placed two top security chiefs at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Elon Musk's government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official told The Associated Press on Sunday. Members of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, eventually did gain access Saturday to the aid agency's classified information, which includes intelligence reports, the former official said. Musk's DOGE crew lacked high-enough security clearance to access that information, so the two USAID security officials — John Vorhees and deputy Brian McGill — were legally obligated to deny access. The current and former U.S. officials had knowledge of the incident and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the information. Musk on Sunday responded to a post about the news on X by saying, 'USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It comes a day after DOGE carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. Musk formed DOGE in cooperation with the new Trump administration with the stated goal of finding ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations. USAID, whose website vanished Saturday without explanation, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs. The Trump administration and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have imposed an unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance that has shut down much of USAID's humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide — compelling thousands of layoffs by aid organizations — and ordered furloughs and leaves that have gutted the agency's leadership and staff in Washington. The U.S. is by far the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, with USAID administering billions of dollars in humanitarian, development and security assistance in more than 100 countries. Peter Marocco, a returning political appointee from Trump's first term, was a leader in enforcing the shutdown. USAID staffers say they believe that agency outsiders with visitors badges asking questions of employees inside Washington headquarters are members of Musk's DOGE team.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usaid-security-leaders-on-leave-after-trying-to-keep-musk-s-inspectors-from-classified-info/7960260.html	2025-02-02T12:33:36-08:00

Dog Man' bites off $36 million, taking No. 1 at box office	New York — DreamWorks Animation's 'Dog Man' fetched $36 million in ticket sales at the weekend box office, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it the biggest debut yet in 2025. It was a big opening for the Universal Pictures release adapted from the popular graphic novel series by author Dav Pilkey. The big-screen launch for the cartoon canine was produced for a modest $40 million, meaning it will easily coast through a profitable run. Audiences gave it an 'A' CinemaScore. Only one animated film before has had a better January launch: 2016’s 'Kung Fu Panda 3.' 'Dog Man,' though, was soft overseas, collecting $4.2 million from 29 international markets. The voice cast of the Peter Hastings-directed movie is led by Pete Davidson, Lil Rel Howery and Isla Fisher. Family movies last year buoyed the box office, with PG-rated films accounting for $2.9 billion, or 33% of all ticket revenue, according to data firm Comscore. So far, they’re lifting 2025, too. The Walt Disney Co.’s December release 'Mufasa: The Lion King' topped the weekend box office three times in January. In its seventh week of release, 'Mufasa' held in third place with another $6.1 million, bringing its global tally to $653 million. 'The PG animation family film wave that was so prevalent in ’24 continues in ’25,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. The horror comedy 'Companion,' from Warner Bros. and New Line, also opened well, with $9.5 million in 3,285 locations. Drew Hancock’s sci-fi tinged film set in the near future is about a group of friends on a weekend lakeside getaway. 'Companion,' starring Sophie Thatcher ('Heretic'), was lightly marketed and made for just $10 million. It will depend on glowing reviews (94% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and strong word of mouth (a 'B+' CinemaScore) to keep drawing moviegoers in the coming weeks. Last week’s top film, Mel Gibson’s 'Flight Risk,' dropped steeply in its second weekend. The action thriller starring Mark Wahlberg fell to fifth place with $5.6 million. Domestically, it has collected $20.9 million for Lionsgate. One of the early year’s standout successes has been Sony Pictures’ 'One of Them Days,' the R-rated comedy starring Keke Palmer and SZA. Though comedies have had a hard time in theaters in recent years, 'One of Them Days' has proven the exception. The well-reviewed movie earned $5.6 million over the weekend, bringing its three-week total to $34.5 million – a stellar result for a movie that cost $14 million to make. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Dog Man,' $36 million. 2. 'Companion,' $9.5 million. 3. 'Mufasa,' $6.1 million. 4. 'One of Them Days,' $6 million. 5. 'Flight Risk' $5.6 million. 6. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $3.2 million. 7. 'Moana 2,' $2.8 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $2.2 million. 9. 'The Brutalist,' $1.9 million. 10. 'Den of Thieves: Pantera,' $1.6 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dog-man-bites-off-36-million-taking-no-1-at-box-office/7960236.html	2025-02-02T11:38:58-08:00	
Mayor says 5 injured in fatal Philadelphia plane crash remain hospitalized, 3 in critical condition	PHILADELPHIA — Three people injured on the ground when a jet crashed in a busy Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven people, remain in critical condition, Mayor Cherelle Parker said Sunday. Parker said 22 people were injured and five of them remain hospitalized. At least 11 homes were significantly damaged, along with some businesses. 'Our city continues to mourn their loss and they are in our thoughts are prayers,' Parker said of the deceased victims. A Mexico-bound air ambulance plummeted to the ground Friday evening, less than a minute after it had taken off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport with six people on board, including a girl who had spent months being treated at a city hospital. One of the deceased was killed inside a car as debris from the Learjet 55 crash exploded into the neighborhood, damaging nearby homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mayor-says-5-injured-in-fatal-philadelphia-plane-crash-remain-hospitalized-3-in-critical-condition-/7960226.html	2025-02-02T11:04:53-08:00	
Trump: Americans could face ‘pain’ with new tariffs on key trading partners	U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans may face economic 'pain' because of new tariffs he is imposing on the country’s three biggest trading partners —Canada, China and Mexico — but contended that it would be 'worth the price' to bolster U.S. interests. Despite sharing a free-trade pact he negotiated with Canada and Mexico in his first term in office, Trump on Saturday imposed 25% tariffs on the two countries set to take effect Tuesday, and hit China with a new 10% levy in addition to already enacted tariffs. Trump claimed the three countries were not doing enough to halt illegal immigration and the deadly opioid fentanyl from entering the United States. In Truth Social posts early Sunday, Trump acknowledged American consumers could face higher prices because of the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay the tariffs to the federal government to import goods from other countries then often pass on at least part, if not all, of their higher costs to consumers rather than absorb their extra expenses themselves. But Trump aimed most of his comments at Canada, targeting one of the U.S.’s closest allies. The U.S. Census Bureau said the U.S. had a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada last year. 'Why? There is no reason,' Trump contended. 'We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.' 'Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!' Trump said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-americans-could-face-pain-with-new-tariffs-on-key-trading-partners-/7960219.html	2025-02-02T10:48:55-08:00	
Protests against Germany’s Merz who supports migration proposal backed by far-right	Berlin — Tens of thousands took to the streets across Germany during the weekend to protest the center-right leader and front-runner in a Feb. 25 election for sending to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that received the backing of a far-right party. Angry protesters in Hamburg, Munich, Cologne and Leipzig said that Friedrich Merz and his Christian Democrats broke Germany's unwritten post-Nazi promise by all democratic parties to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament with the support of far-right, nationalist parties such as the Alternative for Germany (AfD). Merz on Wednesday proposed a nonbinding motion in parliament calling for Germany to turn back many more migrants at its borders. The measure squeaked through thanks to AfD's support. Merz was determined to show commitment of his center-right Union bloc, which also includes the Bavaria-only CSU party, to cutting irregular migration after a deadly knife attack last month by a rejected asylum-seeker. However, on Friday, the German parliament narrowly rejected a bill calling for tougher rules on migration that risked becoming the first draft legislation to pass thanks to a far-right party. Nonetheless, it has become a focus of a controversy about the attitude toward the far right of the front-runner in the upcoming election. Merz has been accused by protesters and politicians on the left of breaking a taboo and endangering mainstream parties’ 'firewall' against AfD. He insists his position is unchanged and that he didn’t and won’t work with the party. Hundreds of protesters temporarily blocked offices of the Christian Democrats in different cities, and Sunday afternoon up to 20,000 came together for a big rally in Berlin. In Cologne, people protested on 350 boats on the Rhine, German news agency dpa reported. The boats lined up in front of the city's skyline with its famous cathedral with protesters holding up banners with slogans such as 'No racism' and 'For democracy and diversity.' Polls show the center-right Union, which put forward the migration proposal and bill, leading with around 30% support, while AfD is second with about 20%, and the Social Democrats and Greens further down. Merz appears to hope that he will gain support by making the Union look decisive in forcing a tougher approach to migration, while blunting the appeal of the anti-immigration AfD and making the governing parties — which say they already have done much to tackle the issue — look out of touch with Germans’ concerns. The 12-year-old AfD first entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of migrants into the country. A year ago, hundreds of thousands also protested in weeks-long rallies all over Germany against the rise of the far-right and purported plans to deport millions of immigrants, including some holding German passports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-against-germany-s-merz-who-supports-migration-proposal-backed-by-far-right/7960206.html	2025-02-02T10:29:41-08:00	
Multiple tremors near Greek island of Santorini shut schools and put residents on edge	ATHENS — A series of earthquakes near the Greek island of Santorini has led authorities to shut down schools, dispatch rescue teams with sniffer dogs and send instructions to residents including a request to drain their swimming pools. Even though earthquake experts say the more than 200 tremors that have hit the area since early Friday are not related to the volcano in Santorini, which once produced one of the biggest eruptions in human history, locals are on edge. The strongest earthquake recorded was magnitude 4.6 at 3:55 p.m. Sunday, at a depth of 14 kilometers, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said. A few tremors of over magnitude 4 and dozens of magnitude 3 have followed. There were no reports of damage or casualties. Earthquake experts and officials from the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection and the fire service have been meeting daily and decided to close schools Monday on the island of Santorini as well as nearby Amorgos, Anafi and Ios. After Sunday's meeting, they also advised residents and hotel owners in Santorini to drain their swimming pools over concerns that large volumes of water could destabilize buildings in case of a strong quake. Another meeting was scheduled Sunday evening at the prime minister’s office with the chief of Greece’s armed forces and other officials. The fire service sent a contingent of rescuers including a sniffer dog on Saturday, and dispatched more forces Sunday, as a precaution. The rescuers have pitched tents in open fields. Island residents have been advised to avoid large open-air events and to move about the islands mindful of rockfalls. All four islands have steep cliffs and, in the case of Santorini, a large part of the main town is built on a cliffside. Experts said it was impossible to predict whether the seismic activity could lead to a stronger tremor, but added that the area could potentially produce a 6-magnitude quake. Mild earthquakes have also been recorded in Santorini’s volcano caldera, which is mostly undersea, since September. The strongest one with magnitude 3.8 occurred on Jan. 25. Since then, seismic activity inside the volcano has subsided, experts say. The Santorini volcano eruption at about 1600 B.C. devastated the island, buried a town, and caused massive earthquakes and flooding that impacted the island of Crete and as far as Egypt. Experts estimate that up to 41.3 cubic kilometers of rocks were ejected and 9-meter tsunamis hit Crete. In the 1990s, the Santorini volcano was designated one of 16 volcanoes around the world that need to be monitored because of past massive eruptions and proximity to dense population areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-tremors-near-greek-island-of-santorini-shut-schools-and-put-residents-on-edge-/7960137.html	2025-02-02T09:02:30-08:00	
Japan launches navigation satellite on new flagship rocket	TOKYO — Japan's space agency said Sunday it successfully launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own. The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island. Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA. Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks. Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network. Michibiki’s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones. Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network. Sunday's launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload. Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series — the larger H3 and a much smaller Epsilon system. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-launches-navigation-satellite-on-new-flagship-rocket-/7960090.html	2025-02-02T08:25:29-08:00	
UK's Starmer, Germany’s Scholz meet as EU 'reset' looms	British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to his country estate Sunday on the eve of seeking to improve relations with the European Union. Starmer hosted Scholz at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence in Buckinghamshire 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of London, before the two go to Belgium to meet with EU chiefs Monday, where the U.K. leader is aiming for a relationship 'reset.' While ruling out rejoining the EU trade bloc five years after Brexit, Starmer said he wants to forge a closer relationship on defense, energy and trade. 'I think that is certainly in the U.K.’s best interest, I do believe it’s in the EU’s best interest, and already I hope that in the last seven months there’s been a manifest difference in approach, tone and relationship,' he said. Starmer and Scholz discussed Ukraine and the Middle East, according to a Starmer spokesperson. The prime minister spoke of their common approach to 'key issues and challenges,' including their shared commitment to Kyiv as the war with Russia enters its fourth year this month. 'When I started as prime minister seven months ago now, I was determined to strengthen the relationship between our two countries — already very good, but I thought it could be stronger on a number of fronts,' said Starmer, leader of the center-left Labour Party. 'And thanks to your leadership, I think we’ve made real progress.' Scholz said the visit that included a walk around the grounds of the estate and a lunch was a 'good sign of the very good relations between our two countries, and indeed between the two of us.' Scholz is up for reelection Feb. 23, where his center-left Social Democrats are lagging in the polls behind the center-right Christian Democratic Union and the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-germany-s-scholz-meet-as-eu-reset-looms/7960082.html	2025-02-02T08:05:54-08:00	
Trump, Netanyahu to discuss war in Gaza, along with Iran, Arab relations	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will discuss his country’s self-declared 'victory over Hamas,' countering Iranian aggression and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries as he meets this week with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump Tuesday is set to greet Netanyahu, the first foreign head of state he is meeting with since taking office for a second four-year term two weeks ago. Trump has been a long-time ally of Netanyahu and dispatched his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to help broker the current six-week ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas and hostage-for-prisoner exchange. But even as the militants have freed 18 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, difficult negotiations lie ahead on the second phase of the truce. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, despite Israel saying it would not allow that to occur. The militants have said they will not release more hostages slated to go free in the second phase of the truce without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase of the truce ends in early March. It's not clear where Trump stands. Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu has said Israel is still committed to a full victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' shock October 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Several dozen remain in Hamas hands, both living and dead. Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of warfare has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children. Israel’s military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. Even with the ceasefire, periodic attacks are still occurring. An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal. In a statement released ahead of his departure for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Trump would discuss 'victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,' referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas. He said that by working together, the U.S. and Israel could 'strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.' Under the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is to release a total of 33 hostages, eight of whom Hamas says are dead, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most areas and allowed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to devastated northern Gaza. Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March. Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday. Trump brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term. He now is seeking a wider agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia. But Riyadh has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war in Gaza ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. The U.S. supports Palestinian statehood, but Netanyahu's government is opposed. Even as the Gaza ceasefire has mostly held for two weeks, Israel has ramped up operations in the occupied West Bank. On Sunday, the military said it was expanding an operation focused on the volatile city of Jenin to the town of Tamun. The Palestinian health ministry said a 73-year-old man was shot dead by Israeli troops in Jenin early Sunday. There was no immediate comment from the military. The ministry had earlier reported five killed, including a 16-year-old, in Israeli airstrikes overnight. The military said it killed two militants — one of whom had been freed as part of the weeklong Gaza ceasefire in November 2023 — in an airstrike on a village near Jenin. It said the two were planning an imminent attack, and that additional strikes targeted two other militant cells. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since the start of the war in Gaza, with Israel launching near-daily military arrest raids. There has also been a rise in settler violence against Palestinians and Palestinian attacks on Israelis. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-netanyahu-to-discuss-war-in-gaza-along-with-iran-arab-relations-/7960068.html	2025-02-02T07:58:31-08:00	
Trump tariff met with mixed reactions from China	Taipei, Taiwan — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose 10% tariffs on Chinese goods has been met with mixed reactions from Beijing, with the Chinese government threatening to roll out countermeasures and some Chinese businesses expressing concerns about potential disruption to their exports to the U.S. market. While the Chinese Ministry of Commerce vowed to challenge the Trump administration’s move at the World Trade Organization, the Chinese foreign ministry emphasized that the trade and tariff wars 'cannot solve the U.S. problems at home and more importantly, does not benefit either side.' Trump previously said the additional tariffs on Chinese goods were Washington’s response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals essential to fentanyl production in Mexico. 'Additional tariffs are not constructive and bound to affect and harm the counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides in the future,' a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. Meanwhile, on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, some internet users said the Trump administration’s move would only backfire and harm American consumers’ interests while others said Washington’s response 'lacks creativity.' 'In the end, he only dares to add 10% tariffs [on Chinese goods] while imposing an additional 25% tariffs on goods from other countries,' wrote Chinese internet user 'Jixiang Wang-bao' on Weibo. Compared to the defiance expressed by some Chinese internet users, some Chinese exporters say they think the additional tariffs would still harm their businesses. 'The additional tariffs will essentially force my company to give up the U.S. market and shift the focus to other countries,' a Chinese consumer electronics exporter surnamed Lin, who asked to only be identified by his last name due to the sensitivity of the issue, told VOA in a written response. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said that while Chinese companies focusing on exporting to the U.S. would experience varying degrees of challenges, the Chinese economy is capable of dealing with the impact of these additional tariffs. 'All parties in China have long anticipated this round of tariff hikes imposed by Trump and relevant businesses in China have made a lot of preparations,' he wrote in a post on Weibo, adding that the Trump administration’s tariff war against China would ultimately harm American consumers and suppliers. Leave room for negotiations While there are differing views about how the additional tariffs might affect the Chinese economy, analysts say the Trump administration’s decision to start with a 10% tariff against Chinese goods shows Washington’s willingness to negotiate with Beijing. 'The Trump administration may use the 10% tariff as a way to push Beijing to reach deals on some issues that are important to the U.S., such as the fentanyl crisis, and show the Chinese government that it could further increase the tariffs to 60% if China is unwilling to engage in negotiation,' said Wu Se-chih, an expert on Chinese politics at Taipei University of Marine Technology. Since the Chinese economy remains sluggish, Wu said Beijing is trying to respond to the additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with less confrontational measures such as filing a claim with the WTO. 'China is hoping to show Washington that it is willing to come to the negotiating table and use negotiations to prevent the Trump administration from further enhancing the tariffs on Chinese goods,' he told VOA by phone. Other experts say that the lower tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on China, compared to the 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, suggest Beijing may have already begun negotiations with Washington. 'China could announce a massive order of Boeing or China could announce a massive increase in imports of shale gas, which could be very useful for Trump,' Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French investment bank Natixis, told VOA by phone. While China may be more prepared to cope with the impact of tariffs imposed by the U.S. due to experiences from Trump’s first term in office, some Chinese economists said the additional tariffs could still seriously affect China’s economic growth. 'The Chinese economy will still be hit hard by the additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration because China has been relying on export to drive economic growth in recent years,' He Jiangbing, an independent Chinese economic commentator, told VOA by phone. Garcia-Herrero said while Trump begins his second term by imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods, the trade imbalance won’t be the main source of tension between China and the U.S. over the next four years. 'Escalation of tension between China and the U.S. will come from important national security issues such as Taiwan and the U.S. military deployment in the Philippines,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-tariff-met-with-mixed-reactions-from-china-/7960026.html	2025-02-02T07:03:39-08:00	
In US, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, predicting 6 more weeks of wintry weather	PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — U.S. groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow Sunday and predicted six more weeks of wintry weather, his top-hatted handlers announced to a raucous, record-sized crowd at Gobbler's Knob in Pennsylvania. Phil was welcomed with chants of 'Phil, Phil, Phil,' and pulled from a hatch on his tree stump shortly after sunrise before a member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club read from a scroll in which he boasted: 'Only I know — you can't trust A.I.' The woodchuck's weather forecast is an annual ritual that goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 'Groundhog Day' movie to transform the event into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond. When Phil is deemed to have not seen his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. When he does see it, there will be six more weeks of winter. The crowd was treated to a fireworks show, confetti and live music that ranged from the Ramones to 'Pennsylvania Polka' as they awaited sunrise and Phil's emergence. Gov. Josh Shapiro, local and state elected officials and a pair of pageant winners were among the dignitaries at the scene. Self-employed New York gingerbread artist Jon Lovitch has attended the event for 33 years. 'I like the cold, you know, and this is probably the best and biggest midwinter party in the entire world,' Lovitch said in Punxsutawney. 'And it's just a really good time.' Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time. What six more weeks of winter means is subjective. Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism. Phil communicated his forecast to Dunkel through 'Groundhog-ese' with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words. 'He'll like wink, he'll purr, he'll chatter, he'll — you know — nod,' Dunkel said. Attendance is free but it cost $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1.6 kilometer trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction was made, some 123 kilometers northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday. Keith Post, his wife and a friend have watched the 'Groundhog Day' movie in each of the past five years and decided this was the time to make the trip from Ohio to witness the event. 'We booked rooms almost a year in advance and we're here,' Post said. 'We're doing it.' A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also put up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings. 'It's a holiday where you don't really owe anyone anything,' said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler and held him up to loud cheers on Sunday. 'You're grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that's just fun to believe in.' Jackie Handley agreed a year ago to visit Punxsutawney for the first time to help a friend check off an item on their bucket list. They were ready for the subfreezing temperatures. 'It's once in a lifetime — we're probably not going to come back. And we have tons of warm clothes,' said Handley, who lives in Falls Church, Virginia. After the forecast was made, club members and Phil posed for photos with people from the crowd. Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family did not join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and sees a veterinarian at least once a year. The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an 'elixir of life' that keeps him immortal. 'There's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,' Dunkel said. 'Just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.' Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, were being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-us-punxsutawney-phil-sees-his-shadow-predicting-6-more-weeks-of-wintry-weather-/7959985.html	2025-02-02T05:59:59-08:00	
Turkey says it will join with neighbors to fight Islamic State group in Syria	ISTANBUL — Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Jordan will come together to fight the remnants of the Islamic State group, a move the Turkish foreign minister says would allow the United States to cut ties with Kurdish militants in Syria. Washington's decadelong relationship with Kurdish-led forces in Syria is opposed by Turkey. Ankara says the People's Defense Units, or YPG, are tied to another Kurdish group listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. The YPG, which spearheads the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, has played a central role in fighting IS alongside American special forces and now guards thousands of IS prisoners in northeast Syria. 'The basic problem is that the YPG has been guarding Daesh inmates and keeping them in prison … they're not doing anything else,' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday, using the Arabic term for IS. 'So Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Jordan need to come together to fight Daesh. We are capable of doing that and God willing this is the step we will be taking as four countries in the near future. We have already done the preliminary talks for that process.' Fidan, who was speaking at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, alongside Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that the new Syrian government had indicated it will take responsibility for IS prisoners. Turkey wants U.S. President Donald Trump to step back from supporting the Kurdish fighters, who Ankara regards as terrorists due to their links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged war against Turkey since 1984. 'We hope that President Trump will make the right decision and right this wrong … it is an open wound that needs to be closed as soon as possible,' Fidan added. Since Syrian rebels launched an offensive to take the country in November, Turkish-backed fighters have targeted Kurdish forces, taking a number of towns. Meanwhile, the Turkish military has maintained pressure on Kurdish fighters in both Syria and northern Iraq. On Sunday, the Defense Ministry said Turkish troops killed 23 'PKK/YPG terrorists' in northern Syria without providing further details. Ankara has called for the Syrian Democratic Forces to be purged of elements linked to the PKK and be absorbed into a future Syrian military. The U.S. currently has around 2,000 troops in northeast Syria. During his first term in office, Trump said he would withdraw all American forces from Syria, which triggered a Turkish offensive against the YPG in 2019. His seemingly warm relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led to speculation that Trump will again seek to remove the U.S. military presence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-says-it-will-join-with-neighbors-to-fight-islamic-state-group-in-syria-/7959979.html	2025-02-02T05:47:54-08:00	
Beyonce competes for the big prize - again - at Sunday's Grammys	LOS ANGELES — The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on Sunday at a celebration that will honor the best of music while acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the industry. Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year with her country record 'Cowboy Carter.' The superstar singer has never won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any other musician. Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift for 'The Tortured Poets Department' and Billie Eilish for 'Hit Me Hard and Soft.' The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those who lost homes in the disaster. 'It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I'm starting to think they're going to be able to do it,' said Paul Grein, awards editor at music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, 'people can take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through that.' Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night's scheduled performers. The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music producer who died in November. At last year's Grammys, Beyonce's husband and rapper Jay-Z argued that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy. 'I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work,' Jay-Z said on stage. 'Cowboy Carter' was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last spring. The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country Music Awards in their nominations in September. The 'Cowboy Carter' nomination is Beyonce's fifth entry in the album of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times, including last year for 'Midnights.' Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of the night's awards. Beyonce's other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for single 'Texas Hold 'Em.' Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are Eilish for 'Birds of a Feather,' Carpenter for 'Please Please Please' and Roan for 'Good Luck, Babe!' In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter's 'Espresso' and Swift's duet with Post Malone, 'Fortnight.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/beyonce-competes-for-the-big-prize---again---at-sunday-s-grammys-/7959937.html	2025-02-02T04:47:11-08:00	
Russia and Ukraine trade blame over attack on boarding school in Russia's Kursk region	KYIV — Competing claims emerged over a deadly attack on a boarding school in Sudzha, a city in Russia's Kursk region that has been under Ukrainian control for five months, with Ukraine and Russia accusing each other of carrying out the strike. The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said Saturday night that four people were killed and a further four seriously wounded in the strike, with 84 people rescued by Ukrainian servicemen from the rubble of the building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Moscow had bombed the boarding school where civilians were sheltering and preparing to evacuate. The General Staff said those in need of additional medical assistance were evacuated to medical facilities in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed in the early hours of Sunday that it was Ukrainian forces that had launched a missile strike on the school, saying that the missiles were launched from Ukraine's Sumy region. Meanwhile, the death toll from a Russian missile strike on an apartment block in the Ukrainian city of Poltava on Saturday rose to 14, including two children, local officials said Sunday. Seventeen people were injured in the attack on the five-story building, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Moscow sent 55 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's Air Force, 40 drones were destroyed during the overnight attacks. A further 13 drones were 'lost', likely having been electronically jammed. Two people were wounded in a drone attack in the Kharkiv region, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Sunday. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that five Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in five regions of western Russia: three over the Kursk region, and one each over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions. A man was killed in a drone strike in the Belgorod region, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-and-ukraine-trade-blame-over-attack-on-boarding-school-in-russia-s-kursk-region-/7959921.html	2025-02-02T04:41:39-08:00	
Putin says ignoring Soviet role in liberation of Nazi death camps is shameful	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin said that ignoring the Soviet Union's role in liberating Nazi German death camps such as Auschwitz and not inviting surviving family members of Soviet troops to liberation anniversaries was a shameful act. A commemoration to mark 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz camp in Poland by Soviet troops was attended by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Britain's King Charles, French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish President Andrzej Duda and many other leaders. Russia, the successor to the Soviet Union, was not invited due to the war in Ukraine. 'This is such a strange, shameful thing to do,' Putin told Russian state television in an interview released on Sunday. 'You can treat the head of the Russian state, me, in any way you want - no one is asking for any invitation. But if you had thought about it, you could have been a lot more subtle.' Putin said that if the Soviet soldiers who took part in the liberation of the camps could not be invited due to health or age, then at least their families could have been invited to the events marking the anniversary of the liberation. As Soviet forces pushed back Nazi troops in Europe in 1944 and 1945, they liberated a number of death camps including Majdanek, Auschwitz, Stutthof, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbrück. U.S. troops liberated Buchenwald and other camps while British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen and other camps. More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, perished at Auschwitz in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease. Poles, Roma and Sinti, and Soviet prisoners of war were also killed there, according to the Auschwitz museum. In all, between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered 6 million Jews across German-occupied Europe. The second largest group of victims of Nazi racial policy after the Jews were Soviet prisoners of war, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Other major groups killed included Soviet citizens, Poles, gypsies, sexual minorities, disabled people and others who offended Nazi ideas of racial superiority. The International Criminal Court has ordered a warrant for Putin's arrest for war crimes in Ukraine. Russia denies the accusations which Moscow says were made up to smear its image.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-says-ignoring-soviet-role-in-liberation-of-nazi-death-camps-is-shameful-/7959933.html	2025-02-02T04:39:59-08:00	
Syria's interim president lands in Saudi Arabia on first trip abroad	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Syria's interim president made his first trip abroad Sunday, traveling to Saudi Arabia in a move likely trying to signal Damascus' shift away from Iran as its main regional ally. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, landed in Riyadh alongside his government's foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani. The two men traveled on a Saudi jet, with a Saudi flag visible on the table behind them. Saudi state television trumpeted the fact that the first trip by al-Sharaa, first known internationally by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, made Riyadh his first destination. Syria's new three-star, tricolor flag flew next to Saudi Arabia's own at the airport as al-Sharaa in a suit and tie walked off the plane. He was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, on the trip. Saudi Arabia had been among the Arab nations that poured money into insurgent groups that tried to topple former President Bashar Assad after Syria's 2011 Arab Spring protests turned into a bloody crackdown. However, its groups found themselves beaten back as Assad, supported by Iran and Russia, fought the war into a stalemate in Syria. That changed with the December lightning offensive led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The group was once affiliated with al-Qaida but has since denounced its former ties. Al-Sharaa and HTS have carefully managed their public image in the time since, with the interim president favoring an olive-colored military look similar to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appointing women to roles and trying to maintain ties to Syria's Christian and Shiite Alawite populations. That also includes keeping both Iran and Russia largely at arms' length as well. Iran has yet to reopen its embassy in Damascus, which had been a key node in running operations through its self-described 'Axis of Resistance,' including Assad's Syria, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and other partners. Russia meanwhile would like to maintain access to air and sea bases it has in Syria, but took in Assad when he fled Syria during the advance. Those moves appear aimed at reassuring the West and trying to get crippling sanctions lifted on Syria. Rebuilding the country after over a decade of war will likely cost hundreds of billions of dollars, not to mention covering the needs of Syria's people, millions of whom remain impoverished. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Damascus in January and said Riyadh has been 'actively engaging in dialogue' to lift sanctions on Syria. Saudi Arabia, unlike Al-Sharaa’s key allies in Turkey and Qatar, restored ties with Assad in 2023 alongside most of the Arab world. Getting sanctions lifted could go a long way in cementing their relationship. Meanwhile, Syria's interim government still faces challenges from the Islamic State group and other militants in the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Manbij, a city in Syria's Aleppo governorate, killing four civilians and wounding nine, SANA reported, citing civil defense officials. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels had seized Manbij in December, part of a push by Ankara to secure Syrian territory close to its border for a buffer zone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-interim-president-lands-in-saudi-arabia-on-first-trip-abroad-/7959905.html	2025-02-02T02:45:40-08:00

Farmers' lawsuit targets ban on sharing seeds in Kenya	KIKUYU, Kenya — Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored. The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms. 'We realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them, especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,' said Desterio Nyamongo, director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season. He said the some of bank's seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding. This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP. Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across Africa are unable to afford healthful diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing. But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers. Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical. During the country's first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry's permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards. The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program. But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost. The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March. Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers from the capital, Nairobi. His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds. 'We have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,' he told The Associated Press. He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash — believed to repel weevils — or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost. Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network. However, 'instead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,' she said. Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged. The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient. The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties. 'It would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,' he said. 'Far from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions, and therefore they are more resilient.' Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban. The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties. 'Indigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases, and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,' he said. Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location. 'The reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,' Ngiri said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-lawsuit-targets-ban-on-sharing-seeds-in-kenya/7959208.html	2025-02-01T23:40:29-08:00	
Artists help fellow creators who lost works, archives in L.A. fires	LOS ANGELES — Anthony Obi never imagined the night of Jan. 7 would be the last time he'd step inside his safe haven. The Houston rapper, known professionally as Fat Tony, has lived in the Altadena neighborhood for a year and says he and his neighbors were prepared for heavy winds and perhaps a few days of power outages. 'I totally expected, you know, maybe my windows are going to get damaged, and I'll come back in, like, a day or two and just clean it up,' said the rapper. But residents like Obi woke up the following morning to news that thousands of homes and entire neighborhoods had been burned to ash, destroyed by flames that wiped out large areas of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. Although the neighborhoods are on opposite ends of the county, they are known hubs for many of the city's creative community, housing filmmakers, actors, musicians and artists of various mediums. 'L.A. is not just rich, famous people who have giant mansions that were destroyed,' said visual artist Andrea Bowers, who is helping artists recover. 'So many members of our community lost everything. They lost all their artworks and their archives - that's irreplaceable, a lifetime of labor and a lifetime of research.' 'A lot of my collectors lost their homes,' said figurative and conceptual artist Salomon Huerta, who lost his Altadena home of three years to the Eaton fire and worries the art scene in L.A. will downsize as a result of the wildfire. 'Before the fire, I was in talks with certain collectors. And then, after the fire, they're not in a good place to talk. I'm hoping that there's support so that the art scene can still thrive. But it's going to be tough.' Obi and Huerta lost not only personal treasures, business opportunities and homes but also vital equipment and professional archives, adding to their emotional burden. Huerta left behind slides and transparencies of past work that he had planned to digitize for an upcoming book. 'Everything's gone,' Obi said. 'All of my stuff that is related to Fat Tony music that was in that house is gone, and it was the motherlode of it.' Grief and Hope Kathryn Andrews never imagined she'd experience another wildfire in her lifetime. The conceptual artist was forced to flee her Pacific Palisades neighborhood as smoke drew near, the second time in four years she's had to escape a wildfire. She lost her Juniper Hills property to the 2020 Bobcat fire, which burned a large section of rural Los Angeles County. 'I've already experienced one home being burned. I think you have a different focus after that. Maybe we become a little bit less attached to material things. And we began looking at a bigger long-term picture, thinking about, you know, how we live together in community, how we live in relation to the land and how we can work together to solve this,' she said. Andrews is the co-founder of relief effort Grief and Hope, which aims to support creatives financially as they enter the long road ahead and was founded alongside a group of gallery directors, art professionals and artists like Bowers, Ariel Pittman, Olivia Gauthier and Julia V. Hendrickson. 'Our primary goal is getting people triage money for just whatever the most emergent need is,' said Pittman. The fundraising effort began shortly after the fires broke out with a Go Fund Me seeking $500,000. They have now raised over $940,000 of their new $1 million goal via The Brick, a nonprofit art space. As of Tuesday, Grief and Hope had received more than 450 inquiries, and Pittman said the funds would be evenly distributed to applicants. The deadline for artists to submit a needs survey has concluded, but the relief effort will continue fundraising until mid-March. Grief and Hope also has five different groups of volunteers providing peer-to-peer support, helping with medical needs, safety issues and renter's issues, and collecting survey data to better serve their creative community. 'These are people who already have made very long-term commitments in their work, including the five of us, towards building community and building sustainability around artists and art workers in our city and beyond,' said Pittman. For Grief and Hope, creating a more sustainable future for artists throughout the city begins with affordable studio spaces and housing. Long road ahead For photographer Joy Wong, losing her home of eight years meant losing the beauty of Altadena. She described the overall area as 'a pocket of heaven.' 'I didn't want to leave,' said Wong, who safely evacuated with her husband and 2-year-old daughter. 'We were just so in love with this house, and it wasn't just my house. It was also my studio space.' Many, like Obi, Wong and Huerta, have started GoFundMe accounts. Meanwhile, initiatives and relief efforts have popped up around Southern California, ready to assist with clothing donations, art supplies, professional equipment for creatives and more. 'I'm applying to everything,' said Obi, who needs to replace his instruments and recording equipment. Wong said she's received much support from family, friends and colleagues. 'I think I just have to kind of lean on the community and get back into shooting,' she said. 'I got to get all my gear back, too. It's going to be a long road, but it'll be OK.' Arts scene rebirth Superchief Gallery co-founder and director Bill Dunleavy said he believes that this is an opportunity to rebuild long-needed infrastructure for the arts throughout Los Angeles. 'Quite a lot was lost in the areas affected by the fire. And it's going to affect rent prices and studio prices and art markets and everything else,' said Dunleavy. 'I've been so impressed with the amount of compassion that people feel and the sense of duty people have felt to help with this. ... I hope that continues into the coming years.' Creative director Celina Rodriguez said she hopes freelance artists and creatives continue to work and shoot production or projects throughout the city, rather than leaving because of the wildfires. 'Having lost so many locations that we would shoot, typically in Malibu, Topanga, the Palisades, all throughout, we will have to absolutely come together and figure out how we can continue working in Los Angeles ... and urge people to shoot productions here,' she said. Rodriguez and Dunleavy began collecting donations at the Downtown Los Angeles gallery and within 48 hours transformed it into a bustling donation center with over 150 volunteers. The duo are now working with displaced families to make sure their daily needs are being met. Dunleavy said the relief effort has only encouraged him to take this work beyond just the donation center and explore the possibilities of nonprofit work for the community. 'All of our wheels are turning now that we've seen the power that just self-organizing can have.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/artists-help-fellow-creators-who-lost-works-archives-in-l-a-fires/7957921.html	2025-02-01T23:39:51-08:00	
Couple challenges Vatican bank's ban on workplace marriages	ROME — Pope Francis has long urged couples to marry and have babies rather than dogs. And he has long championed the rights of workers and held up labor itself as the foundation of human dignity. So it has come as something of a surprise to many in the Holy See that the Vatican bank fired a newlywed couple, with three young children between them, after a new internal bank regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages. The apparent contradiction between what the pope preaches and what his Vatican practices isn't lost on Silvia Carlucci and Domenico Fabiani, who on Thursday challenged the ban in a wrongful termination lawsuit before the Vatican tribunal. During the hearing, presiding Judge Venerando Marano asked if the two sides would consider a settlement. The couple is open to a deal but the bank refused, said the couple's attorney Laura Sgro. A new hearing was scheduled for March 14. Ahead of Thursday's hearing, the couple told The Associated Press this week that they never once considered calling off their Aug. 31, 2024, nuptials after learning of the new regulation. And they said they couldn't contemplate the bank's suggestion that one of them quit to avoid running afoul of the new rule, because of financial obligations to their children, former spouses and new mortgage. 'I thought for sure there might have been an intervention by the Holy Father, who rightly gives so much emphasis and value to the role of the family,' Fabiani said in the office of his lawyer, with Carlucci by his side. 'And yet here we find a family that works there and now finds itself on the street.' Grasping for her husband's hand, Carlucci was more blunt: 'There's a great contrast between what truly happens (in the Vatican) and what is promoted.' A tipping point in employee discontent The plight of the 41-year-olds, who between them worked for 25 years at the Institute for Religious Works, as the bank is known, has captured the attention of many in the Vatican, where employment has long been a coveted mark of status in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy. A Vatican job comes with real benefits: tax-free income, access to a duty-free gas station, supermarket, pharmacy and department store and if lucky, access to below-market rents in some of the Holy See's palazzi in Rome. But for the past several years, amid a financial crisis that has resulted in hiring freezes, cuts to overtime, seniority bonuses and other benefits, employee discontent seems to be on the rise, with the Carlucci-Fabiani case something of a tipping point in a system where truly independent legal recourse doesn't exist. The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, has taken up the couple's cause, issuing an online solidarity appeal on their behalf. It has asserted that the new rule violates basic human rights as well as the Vatican's fundamental laws and the church's canon law, which in the Vatican take legal precedence over internal regulations. 'While we are confident that God will provide for them and their children, we cannot silence the voice of our conscience that recognizes the traits of injustice and lack of charity in the measure that affected these two former colleagues,' the online appeal reads. 'The application of a regulation, while necessary in the governance of any institution, cannot fail to take into account the fact that any institution is made up of people and stands by virtue of the activity and professionalism of these same people.' The unusual role of the Vatican bank The Institute for Religious Works, or IOR as it is known, is a peculiar institution, created in 1942 to help the church carry out its charitable mission while enabling Vatican embassies and religious orders in far-flung parts of the world to send and receive money when commercial banking might be problematic. Located in a tower just steps inside Vatican City, the bank was long mired in scandal but spent over a decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. The reforms slimmed down its client base to around 12,300 customers among Vatican offices, employees, religious orders and embassies, who are served by a staff of around 100 at its lone Vatican branch. According to the couple, the bank management announced a new personnel policy on May 2, laying out criteria for employment that said marriage between an IOR employee and another bank employee, or anyone else who works in the Vatican City State, was cause for termination. The change shocked them: Three months earlier, they had told bank management of their plans to wed after securing the Catholic decrees of nullity for their previous marriages. Carlucci got an advance on her yearly bonus to help secure their mortgage. They had formally publicized their pending nuptials in Rome city hall and their respective parishes. 'They congratulated us, 'A wedding, how wonderful this marriage. Great job, you made it,'' Carlucci recalls her superiors telling her. But now, the couple doesn't even have access to Italian unemployment benefits because of the nature of their termination, she said. Couple's employment terminated The bank has strongly defended its policy as being consistent with best bank practices to promote transparency and impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest. It says it actually delayed implementing the policy until the last of five married couples in its workforce had retired in March. With such a small staff and one branch, 'this rule is in fact essential to prevent both inevitable professional conflicts of interest between the aspiring spouses concerned, as well as the emergence of possible familistic management doubts among its customers or the general public,' it said in a statement. And yet anyone familiar with the Vatican knows plenty of married partners who work in the city state, not necessarily in the same department but among the 4,500 people employed by the Holy See. While expressing 'deep regret,' the bank said it had 'reached the difficult decision' to terminate the couple's employment on Oct. 1, a month after their church wedding. It is unclear why the bank didn't just terminate one of the two. A transfer to an unrelated Vatican office wasn't possible under the terms of the new regulation. The pope seems aware morale is low The couple had written to Francis personally, hoping he might intervene, but received no reply. Francis though seems keenly aware that employee morale is low and that times are tough for families. He recently approved the opening of the Vatican's first day-care center, as well as a 'baby bonus' of an extra 300 euros a month for Vatican employees with three or more children. During his annual Christmas greetings to Vatican personnel last month, dedicated to the theme of family and work, Francis urged employees to talk to their managers if they have problems. 'If anyone has any special difficulties, please speak up, tell the people in charge, because we want to solve all difficulties,' Francis told the Dec. 21 audience, attended by far fewer people than in past years. 'And this is done by dialogue and not by shouting or being silent.' Carlucci would like her job back but says her new marriage and blended family matter more. 'For us, family is at the basis of our entire lives, so no matter what happens and despite everything, we have won,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/couple-challenges-vatican-bank-s-ban-on-workplace-marriages/7957913.html	2025-02-01T23:39:10-08:00	
1 dead, thousands urged to evacuate as Australia's northeast battles floods	SYDNEY — One person died on Sunday in Australia's north Queensland state in heavy flooding, authorities said, urging thousands of people to move to higher ground because of torrential rains. Queensland authorities said major flooding was underway in coastal Hinchinbrook Shire, a locality of about 11,000 people about 500 kilometers north of state capital, Brisbane. Several suburbs in the nearby city of Townsville were also affected, authorities said. North Queensland has large zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore. Townsville is a major processing center for the region's base metals. In 2019, severe floods in the area disrupted lead and zinc concentrate rail shipments and damaged thousands of properties. 'Residents in low-lying areas should collect their evacuation kit and move to a safe place on higher ground. This situation may pose a threat to life and property,' regional emergency management authorities said on Sunday morning. The flooding was triggered by heavy rain from a low-pressure system rich in tropical moisture, Australia's weather forecaster said on its website, adding that 24-hour rainfall totals were likely up to 30 centimeters. 'The potential for heavy, locally intense rainfall and damaging winds may continue into early next week subject to the strength and position of the trough and low,' it said. Frequent flooding has hit Australia's east in recent years including 'once in a century' floods that inundated the neighboring Northern Territory in January 2023 during a multiyear La Nina weather event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-thousands-urged-to-evacuate-as-australia-s-northeast-battles-floods/7959859.html	2025-02-01T19:02:59-08:00	
UK to become 1st country to criminalize AI child abuse tools	LONDON — Britain will become the first country to introduce laws against AI tools used to generate sexual abuse images, the government announced Saturday. The government will make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate sexualized images of children, punishable by up to five years in prison, interior minister Yvette Cooper revealed. It will also be illegal to possess AI 'pedophile manuals' which teach people how to use AI to sexually abuse children, punishable by up to three years in prison. 'We know that sick predators' activities online often lead to them carrying out the most horrific abuse in person,' said Cooper. The new laws are 'designed to keep our children safe online as technologies evolve. It is vital that we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline,' she added. 'Children will be protected from the growing threat of predators generating AI images and from online sexual abuse as the U.K. becomes the first country in the world to create new AI sexual abuse offences,' said a government statement. AI tools are being used to generate child sexual abuse images by 'nudeifying' real life images of children or by 'stitching the faces of other children onto existing images,' said the government. The new laws will also criminalize 'predators who run websites designed for other pedophiles to share vile child sexual abuse content or advice on how to groom children,' punishable by up to ten years in prison, said the government. The measures will be introduced as part of the Crime and Policing Bill when it comes to parliament. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has warned of the growing number of sexual abuse AI images of children being produced. Over a 30-day period in 2024, IWF analysts identified 3,512 AI child abuse images on a single dark web site. The number of the most serious category of images also rose by 10% in a year, it found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-become-1st-country-to-criminalize-ai-child-abuse-tools/7959851.html	2025-02-01T17:54:41-08:00	
US says life-saving HIV treatment can continue during aid pause	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department said Saturday that the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) -- the world's leading HIV initiative -- was covered by a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance during a 90-day pause in foreign aid. Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump ordered the pause so foreign aid contributions could be reviewed to see if they align with his 'America First' foreign policy. The U.S. is the world's largest aid donor. Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially issued a waiver for emergency food aid and then Tuesday for life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence help. However, the lack of detail in Trump's order and the ensuing waivers has left aid groups confused as to whether their work can continue. So, Saturday the State Department's Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy issued a memo, seen by Reuters, clarifying that PEPFAR was covered by the Jan. 28 memo and spelling out what activities were allowed. These include life-saving HIV care and treatment services, including testing and counseling, prevention and treatment of infections including tuberculosis (TB), laboratory services, and procurement and supply chain for commodities/medicines. It also allows prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. 'Any other activities not specifically mentioned in this guidance may not be resumed without express approval,' it said. More than 20 million people living with HIV, who represent two-thirds of all people living with the disease receiving treatment globally, are directly supported by PEPFAR. Under Trump's foreign aid pause, all payments by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) stopped Tuesday — for the first time since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 — and have not resumed, according to U.S. Treasury data. On Monday USAID paid out $8 million and last week a total of $545 million. The Trump administration is also moving to strip a slimmed-down USAID of its independence and put it under State Department control, two sources familiar with the discussions said Friday, in what would be a significant overhaul of how Washington allocates U.S. foreign aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-life-saving-hiv-treatment-can-continue-during-aid-pause/7959846.html	2025-02-01T17:36:25-08:00	
Anti-graft protesters march, block bridges in Serbia	NOVI SAD, SERBIA — Hundreds of students protesting graft they blame for 15 deaths in a building collapse marched Friday through Serbia to the northern city of Novi Sad where they planned to block three Danube River bridges this weekend. They received a hero's welcome from fellow students and thousands of residents in Novi Said after arriving on foot in their two-day, 80-kilometer (50-mile) journey from the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A small red carpet had been placed on one of the bridges across the Danube that the students crossed as they entered the city. Saturday's bridge blockade marks three months since a huge concrete construction at the railway station collapsed in Novi Sad on November 1, leaving 15 people dead. Carrying wreaths with the names of the 15 victims, the students from Novi Sad and Belgrade on Friday evening together headed toward the station building to honor the people who died in the accident. Many people cried when the students from Belgrade arrived, reflecting high emotions over the accident and the continuing struggle for justice. What started as a protest of suspected corruption in construction contracts has developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country's powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, a driver rammed a car into a silent protest Friday, injuring two women who work as doctors at a nearby psychiatric institution. Media reports say both hit their heads on the pavement and are being examined. The incident, the third of its kind in weeks, happened in downtown Belgrade during 15 minutes of silence observed daily throughout Serbia, at the same time as the canopy collapsed in Novi Sad. A witness, Dr. Elena Matkovic, told N1 television that the driver first reversed his car for a short distance, and the protesters thought he would turn around, away from the blockade, but instead he accelerated forward, slamming into people. 'We really did not expect that he would drive through a crowd of people,' she told N1. 'If you are asking me whether we will stop (the blockades,) we most certainly will not. This is not the moment to stop.' Protesters have repeatedly faced attacks, including on students, with drivers ramming cars into demonstrations on two previous occasions. Two people were seriously injured. Along the way to Novi Sad on Friday, the students were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks. Hundreds more people on bicycles headed separately toward Novi Sad on Friday while Belgrade's taxi drivers said they would come too and give the marchers a lift home Sunday. When the students reached the town of Indija on Thursday, roughly halfway along their 80-kilometer (50-mile) route, they were welcomed with fireworks and cheers from residents. Although most of them spent the night out in the open in a soccer field, the freezing temperatures did not dampen their desire for major change in the corruption-ridden Balkan state. Nevena Vecerinac, a student, said she hoped the protesters' demands that include the punishment of all those responsible for the rail station tragedy will be fulfilled. 'We need support from all people. With this energy and mood, I hope we can do it, otherwise there will be no brighter future,' said Luka Arsenovic, another student marcher. Many in Serbia believe that the collapse of the overhang at the train station was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies. Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. Monthslong demonstrations have already forced the resignation of Serbia's Prime Minister Milos Vucevic this week, along with various concessions from authorities that were ignored by the protesters who say that is not enough. Vucic and other officials have shifted from accusing the students of working with foreign powers to oust him from power, to offering concessions to the students while issuing veiled threats against them saying that his supporters' 'patience is running out.' He said Friday that 'it is clear that the country is under attack both from the outside and from the inside.' 'We will know how to fight, we will be flexible, we will seek conversation and dialogue (with the protesters), but we will know how to save the country,' he said. The strength and determination of the protesters have caught many by surprise in a country where hundreds of thousands of young people have emigrated, looking for opportunities elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anti-graft-protesters-march-block-bridges-in-serbia/7959835.html	2025-02-01T16:47:07-08:00	
Pope stumbles, but avoids falling when cane snaps	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis tripped while entering the Vatican auditorium for an audience Saturday after the handle of his walking stick snapped, but he avoided falling. The 88-year-old pope often must use a wheelchair or a cane because of bad knees and has fallen twice in the past two months. After Saturday's slight stumble, two aides helped him to his chair on the stage and the audience proceeded without incident. After he recovered someone in the audience shouted 'Viva il Papa' and the audience applauded. Earlier in January, Francis fell and hurt his right arm. It wasn't broken, but a sling was put on as a precaution. On December 7, the pope whacked his chin on his nightstand in an apparent fall that resulted in a bad bruise. The pontiff has long battled health problems including bouts of bronchitis. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel. Speculation about Francis' health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Benedict's aides have attributed the decision to a nighttime fall that he suffered during a 2012 trip to Mexico, after which he determined he couldn't keep up with the globe-trotting demands of the papacy. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography 'Hope' released this month, Francis said that he hadn't considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-stumbles-but-avoids-falling-when-cane-snaps-/7959665.html	2025-02-01T16:03:37-08:00

US strikes stronghold of Islamic State affiliate in Somalia	WASHINGTON — U.S. warplanes took aim at the Islamic State affiliate in Somalia, hitting what officials described as high-ranking operatives in the terror group's mountainous stronghold. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the precision strike Saturday on social media, describing the main target as a 'Senior ISIS Attack Planner and other terrorists he recruited and led.' 'These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our Allies,' Trump said. 'The strikes destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians.' A separate statement from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted an area in Somalia's Golis mountains, and 'further degrades ISIS's ability to plot and conduct terrorist attacks threatening US citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians.' Neither Trump nor Hegseth named the IS planner, though U.S. officials said the strikes were carried out in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia. General Adan Abdi Hashi, commander of the Puntland Devish Forces said the airstrikes targeted at least 10 locations of the Islamic State militants in the Cal-Miskaad area, which is part of the Golis mountains. 'The strikes targeted about 10 locations in the Cal-Miskaad areas, most of them caves, and we believe that many of the militants were killed,' said the general. Residents in Qandala, a small town in Bari region of Puntland told VOA on the condition of anonymity because they feared for their lives, that they could see from the distance plumes of smoke and flames, and that they could hear at least seven huge explosions. Officials from Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region thanked the U.S. on social media, calling the operation a success. 'The latest airstrike, carried out today, resulted in the elimination of several high-ranking #ISIS members,' according to the statement. U.S. Africa Command, which oversees U.S, military efforts on the continent, said it, too, assessed multiple terror operatives had been killed. The Islamic State, also known as IS or Daesh, has increasingly played a key role in the terror group's operations in Africa and beyond. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's capabilities. As a result, IS-Somalia has become both a key cog in the IS financial network, funneling money to affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Africa. IS-Somalia has, at the same time, become more influential under the leadership of Abdulkadir Mumin, a former militant with the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, who is thought to now head IS' directorate of provinces, overseeing the terror group's affiliates in Africa. Some U.S. officials worry Mumin has risen even higher, perhaps acting as the Islamic State's top emir. Others disagree but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure. The U.S. previously targeted Mumin in May of last year. Recent intelligence assessments have further warned IS-Somalia has more than doubled in size over the past year and may now boast up to as many as 1,600 fighters, bolstered by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. Most of IS-Somalia's manpower has been concentrated in Puntland, especially in the Golis Mountains, also known as the Cal-Miskaad mountains. Saturday's airstrike, the first against IS in Somalia so far this year, was carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, currently in the Red Sea, according to defense officials who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss details of the operation. It comes as Somali forces in Puntland continue a military offensive against ISIS militants hiding in Cal-Miskaad mountains. Puntland also thanked the United Arab Emirates which they say provided air support to the ongoing offensive. The operations, which started in late December 31, drove militants from vast areas in the northeastern highlands of Somalia. The militants, many of them foreigners, have claimed carrying out IED attacks against Puntland forces. The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150 kilometers southeast of Bosaso. The Somali government called Saturday's airstrikes by the U.S. 'a critical step in our shared fight against terrorism.' 'The Federal Government of Somalia welcomes the firm and decisive counterterrorism efforts led by the United States,' it said in a statement. 'Together, we will continue to dismantle extremist networks ... and build a future free from the scourge of terrorism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-strikes-stronghold-of-islamic-state-affiliate-in-somalia/7959636.html	2025-02-01T14:52:03-08:00	
Trump enacts tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China	WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China, the White House said. 'Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal immigrants into our country,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing Friday. Leavitt did not say whether there would be any exemptions to the measures. 'These are promises made and promises kept by the president,' she said. Asked by reporters Friday, Trump said there was nothing the three countries could do to reverse his decision and that the tariffs were 'not a negotiating tool.' 'It's a pure economic — we have big deficits with, as you know, with all three of them,' Trump said. 'We're not looking for a concession, and we'll just see what happens.' Trump had said he would tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10% beginning Saturday. Other Canadian goods would be hit with a 25% tariff. The president vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas. 'All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,' Trump said. 'And we'll be doing, very importantly, steel, and we'll also be doing chips and things associated with chips.' The tentative plan is for the tariffs to take effect on Tuesday. Trump warned he would 'absolutely' place tariffs on goods from the European Union. 'They're treating us so badly,' he said. Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would respond. 'We're working hard to prevent these tariffs, but if the United States moves ahead, Canada's ready with a forceful and immediate response,' he posted on social media. Meanwhile, Mexico had a more muted response. Its economic ministry posted a message on social media saying that Mexico and the United States were 'partners, not competitors.' Tariffs could backfire China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods and services imported into or bought from the United States. Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire. Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. GDP, while exports make up around 2.5% percent of U.S. GDP, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a 'tax hike on imports from those countries' and will 'have an immediate and negative impact on the U.S. economy,' he told VOA. 'It's a strategy for shrinking the U.S. economy.' Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and has praised its use as an effective economic policy. Trump believes that 'tariffs are a great source of leverage,' and that he will 'convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under the threat of tariffs,' Setser said. 'But these measures are going to be pretty costly to the U.S.' Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a 'short-term disruption' for consumers but said it would lead to a long-term benefit for U.S. manufacturing. 'Tariffs don't cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,' he said. During his first administration in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow the United States' big trade deficit — the gap between what it sells and what it buys — with its neighbors. He once called the deal 'the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law.' However, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023. 'He's now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency fix,' said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. There's no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy that's not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said. 'Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,' he added. Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs 'don't stop illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in Mexico.' The stock market erased early gains and closed lower Friday after the White House announcement on tariffs.

Naval arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveil underground missile facility	TEHRAN, IRAN — The naval arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled a new underground missile facility on the south coast in footage aired by state television Saturday, two weeks after unveiling an underground naval base. 'Hundreds of cruise missiles capable of countering enemy destroyers' electronic warfare are stationed in these underground cities,' the televised report said. 'The systems are being kept hundreds of meters underground and can be operational in a very short time,' it said without giving an exact location of the base. 'These systems and missiles can be armed and fired from hundreds of kilometers away and can hit targets far out at sea.' Guards chief General Hossein Salami toured the base with naval arm commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri. The report also unveiled a new model of cruise missile dubbed Ghadr-380 which Tangsiri said had 'anti-jamming capabilities' and a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles). He said the new missiles could 'create hell for enemy vessels.' Last month, the Guards unveiled an underground naval base for assault boats operating in Iran's southern waters, which include the Gulf and the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In early January, Iran's armed forces began a series of exercises, dubbed Eqtedar ('Mighty' in Farsi), which are set to continue until mid-March. The drills have included naval maneuvers that saw the unveiling of an advanced reconnaissance ship as well as exercises on safeguarding Iran's nuclear facilities from attack by Israel or the United States. The military exercises come as Iran waits to see what policy U.S. President Donald Trump will follow in his second term. During his first term that ended in 2021, Trump pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against Iran, withdrawing the United States from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, and reimposing biting sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/naval-arm-of-iran-s-revolutionary-guards-unveil-underground-missile-facility/7959608.html	2025-02-01T13:38:10-08:00	
4 media organizations 'rotated' out of Pentagon press corps offices	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, in an unprecedented move, announced late Friday it would remove four media organizations including The New York Times from their dedicated office spaces in the Pentagon, citing a desire to make room for others. The memo on a 'New Annual Media Rotation Program' said it would also remove National Public Radio, NBC News and Politico, which must vacate their spaces by February 14. In their place, it would give dedicated office space to the New York Post, One America News Network, Breitbart News Network and HuffPost News. Each year going forward, one outlet from print, online, television and radio will rotate out of the Pentagon 'to allow a new outlet from the same medium that has not had the unique opportunity to report as a resident member of the Pentagon Press Corps,' the memo said. 'We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades,' an NBC News spokesperson said by email. 'Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.' The New York Times said it remained committed to covering the Pentagon 'fully and fairly' despite the move. 'Steps designed to impede access are clearly not in the public interest,' The Times said in a statement. NPR called on the Defense Department to expand office space available so all media outlets covering the Pentagon receive equal access. 'This decision interferes with the ability of millions of Americans to directly hear from Pentagon leadership, and with NPR's public interest mission to serve Americans who turn to our network of local public media stations in all 50 states,' it said. Politico did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. More than two dozen news organizations operate out of the Pentagon, including Reuters, reporting on the daily activities of the U.S. military. 'To be clear, the outlets that vacate the spaces loaned them by the secretary (of defense) will remain full members of the Pentagon Press Corps,' said John Ullyot, acting assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. 'The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps.' The Pentagon Press Association, which represents journalists who cover the Defense Department, said it was 'greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media.' Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association's four-member board of directors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/media-organizations-rotated-out-of-pentagon-press-corps-offices-/7959594.html	2025-02-01T13:00:49-08:00	
Taliban decry US claims about frozen Afghan assets	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials denounced Saturday claims that the United States could regain custody of Afghanistan's frozen central bank funds, warning that any such action would be 'unacceptable.' The Taliban-led Ministry of Economy issued the warning in response to the latest quarterly report released to the U.S. Congress on Friday stating that the government in Kabul is not recognized by Washington and has been subjected to economic sanctions. In August 2021, when Taliban insurgents retook control of the country just days before the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops, then-President Joe Biden froze about $7 billion in assets that were held in the U.S. by the Afghan central bank. Additionally, European countries froze around $2 billion. Washington subsequently transferred half of the frozen funds, amounting to $3.5 billion, to a newly established 'Afghan Fund' in Switzerland. That fund is intended to support humanitarian assistance in impoverished Afghanistan while ensuring that the Taliban cannot access the money, but no payments have since been released. The remaining $3.5 billion was retained in the U.S. to fund potential compensation for ongoing court cases against the Taliban, brought by families of the September 11, 2001, attack victims. 'With accrued interest, the fund has now grown to nearly $4 billion,' said the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in its report to Congress on Friday. 'As part of the current review of foreign assistance, the administration and the Congress may want to examine returning these funds to the custody and control of the U.S. government,' it added. 'The Taliban want these funds even though they have no legal right to them since they are not recognized by the United States as the government of Afghanistan, are on the U.S. Specially Designated Global Terrorist list, and are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions,' the SIGAR stressed. The agency referred to President Donald Trump's order issued after his inauguration last month, which suspended almost all foreign aid for three months pending a review to determine what aligns with his 'America First' policy. The de facto Afghan ministry dismissed the objections, saying freezing central bank assets has undermined their national economy. It renewed Kabul's call for the international community to return the more than $9 billion to the central bank, saying it belongs to the Afghan nation and can play a critical role in ensuring monetary and economic stability. 'Any action by the United States regarding the allocation, use, or transfer of these reserves is unacceptable,' the Taliban statement warned. The SIGAR report argued that Washington has spent more than $3.7 billion in Afghanistan since withdrawing its troops from the country, saying most of that money went to U.N. and partner agencies delivering humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. It noted that another $1.2 billion remains available in the pipeline for possible disbursement. However, the Taliban disputed the assertions and claimed that U.S. spending had no significant impact on the Afghan economy. SIGAR said that the United States remains the largest donor to Afghanistan, where millions of people need humanitarian aid, according to U.N. assessments. 'While this assistance may have staved off famine in the face of economic collapse, it has not dissuaded the Taliban from taking U.S. citizens hostage, dismantling the rights of women and girls, censoring the media, allowing the country to become a terrorist safe haven, and targeting former Afghan government officials,' the U.S. agency wrote in the report. Since retaking power three-and-a-half years ago, the hard-line Taliban have banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and suspended female university education across Afghanistan. Women are prohibited from visiting public places, such as gyms and parks. They must wear face coverings in public and have a chaperone for road or air travel. The Taliban defend their policies, saying they are aligned with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, dismissing international criticism as an interference in the country's internal affairs. The sweeping restrictions on Afghan women and other human rights concerns, as well as the Taliban's alleged ties with terrorist groups, have deterred the international community from granting legitimacy to the de facto Afghan government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-decry-us-claims-about-frozen-afghan-assets/7959576.html	2025-02-01T12:11:59-08:00	
Third expulsion attempt fails as migrants in Albania returned to Italy	SHENGJIN, ALBANIA — An Italian navy ship on Saturday took migrants to Italy from asylum processing centers in Albania following a court decision in Rome. It was the third failed attempt by Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government to process migrants in the non-EU country. A coast guard ship took 43 migrants from the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers northwest of the capital, Tirana. They were among the 49 men who were transferred to Albania on an Italian naval ship Tuesday. Six were returned the same day for being minors or deemed vulnerable. Italian media reported the men were from Bangladesh, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Gambia. An Italian appeals court in Rome on Friday refused to approve the speedy expulsion of 43 asylum-seekers detained in Albania since Tuesday under a controversial migration deal to move the proceedings beyond European Union borders. The court referred the case to the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, which is expected to issue a ruling on Feb. 25 related to the previous cases, in which the series of lower court rulings have opened a fissure between the Meloni government and the Italian judicial system. In October and November, judges similarly refused to approve the expulsion of much smaller groups of migrants, seeking clarity from the European court on which countries were safe for repatriation of people whose asylum claims are rejected. Italy last year signed a five-year agreement to process up to 3,000 migrants a month beyond EU borders as part of Meloni’s program to combat illegal migration to Italy, which is the first landfall for tens of thousands of migrants who make the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean Sea. While the agreement has raised concerns among human rights activists, European partners have expressed interest in the project. In the first four weeks of this year, 3,704 migrants arrived in Italy, almost three times as many as in the same period last year. In the whole of last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy, a drop of 58% from the previous year. The largest nationality was Bangladeshis, followed by Syrians, Tunisians and Egyptians, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/third-expulsion-attempt-fails-as-migrants-in-albania-returned-to-italy/7959550.html	2025-02-01T10:52:01-08:00	
Trump says Venezuela agrees to receive undocumented migrants captured in US	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Venezuela has agreed to receive all Venezuelan undocumented migrants captured in the United States and pay for their transport. 'Venezuela has agreed to receive, back into their country, all Venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the U.S., including gang members of Tren de Aragua,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. He said Venezuela has also agreed to provide transportation. The Venezuelan government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. U.S. envoy Richard Grenell met with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in the South American country on Friday. Hours after their meeting, six American hostages were released and returned to the United States from Venezuela. The announcement of Venezuela's decision to accept the return of its citizens who were illegally in the United States comes one week after Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions after Colombia refused to accept military flights carrying deportees. Colombia reversed its course and agreed to accept migrants following the threats. 'We are in the process of removing record numbers of illegal aliens from all countries,' said Trump, who vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in his 2024 presidential campaign. Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders to crack down on illegal immigration after taking office on Jan. 20, including actions aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal status.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-venezuela-agrees-to-receive-undocumented-migrants-captured-in-us/7959511.html	2025-02-01T10:01:10-08:00	
Several government web pages have gone dark complying with Trump orders	Several U.S. government web pages changed or went dark Friday as agencies scrambled to comply with President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring his administration would recognize only two genders and ordering an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In a letter sent Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to terminate grants and contracts related to 'gender ideology,' ask staff to remove pronouns from their government emails and disband resource groups on the issue, too. The directive, which ordered agencies to institute changes by 5 p.m. Friday, also asked agencies to remove the term 'gender' from government forms and swap it out with 'sex.' Here is a list of changes and missing pages seen so far. Several pages have popped up since being taken down, some with changes: National Park Service pages for historic sites related to the internment of Japanese Americans, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Stonewall Uprising for gay rights were inaccessible. The Tuskegee site was back online a short time later, but the others remained down Friday evening. The State Department removed the 'X' gender marker and replaced 'gender' with 'sex' on online consular forms. A page with tips for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex travelers was altered. It's now titled 'LGB Travelers' instead of 'LGBTQIA+ Travelers.' The Census Bureau's homepage was down. Links to reports and topic pages outlining details about the gender identity, sexual orientation and characteristics of the nation’s population returned errors. A message Friday afternoon for one topic page titled 'Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity' read, 'The area of census.gov that you are trying to access is currently unavailable due to maintenance.' Another page titled 'Mental Health Struggles Higher Among LGBT Adults Than Non-LGBT Adults in All Age Groups' also was unavailable. Archives of both pages show they were accessible within the past week. The bureau’s homepage was up Saturday morning. Intelligence Community Inspector General reports were scrubbed from the website of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Trump previously fired around 17 inspectors general — known as independent government watchdogs — at multiple federal agencies. A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled 'Inmate Gender' was relabeled 'Inmate Sex' on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website took down much public health information: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. The agency also removed its data repository, data.cdc.gov. A message said 'the website will resume operations once in compliance' with Trump's executive order. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity months, including Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Disability Employment Awareness Month and National American Indian Heritage Month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-government-web-pages-have-gone-dark-complying-with-trump-orders/7959501.html	2025-02-01T09:45:20-08:00	
UN decries sexual violence as weapon of war in DRC	GENEVA — As fighting between M23 rebels and Congolese armed troops escalate in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warns that the warring parties increasingly are using rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war. 'Conflict-related sexual violence has been an appalling feature of armed conflict in eastern DRC for decades,' said Jeremy Laurence, spokesperson for U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk. Laurence emphasized that the high commissioner 'is particularly concerned this latest escalation risks deepening' the 'conflict-related sexual violence much further.' The ongoing crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, or the DRC, continues to escalate, with tensions involving the Congolese government and the M23 rebel group. The DRC government has officially designated the M23 rebel group as a terrorist organization, while the United Nations and the United States classify it as an armed rebel group. The DRC government has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group, a claim that Rwanda denies. Kigali, in turn, alleges that Kinshasa collaborates with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Hutu armed group with ties to the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, an allegation the DRC rejects. Military operations in the region remain fluid, with clashes leading to significant displacement and humanitarian concerns. Analysts warn that continued instability risks deepening the regional conflict, and several peacekeepers from the Southern African Development Community already have been killed since the recent rebel offensive. The key parties involved in the crisis include the DRC government, the M23 rebels and Rwanda. And all are pointing fingers at each other and claiming advances in one form or another. Laurence told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday there has been a marked increase in the incidence of rape and sexual violence, as fighting between the hostile armed forces has expanded toward South Kivu, following M23’s takeover nearly a week ago of Goma — North Kivu’s mineral-rich capital. Since the crisis started, the United Nations has received reports of more than 200 cases of rape and sexual violence. 'The numbers, sadly, will likely be higher,' Laurence said. 'As we know, in past conflicts, often for reasons of stigmatization, could be for social, cultural or personal reasons, many women may not report instances of this. The grim story is, the figure is, dare I say, higher, considerably.' Tarik Jasarevic, spokesperson for the World Health Organization, warned that 'with the higher risk of violence, including rape, there is a risk for pregnant women, and we know that there is a high maternal death rate that we observed even before this violence. 'Also, in this part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have had a crisis of malaria, measles, cholera and the new, more severe strain of mpox. So, with this violence, the increased spread of these viruses is even bigger,' he said. The United Nations reports at least 700 people have been killed and more than 2,800 injured since M23 rebels seized Goma on Sunday. DRC Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner has accused Rwanda of illegally occupying part of her country by using what she alleges are a proxy, the M23 rebels, whom the DRC designates as terrorists. Kayikwamba said Friday that Rwanda was trying to orchestrate a regime change. Yolande Makolo, Rwanda’s government spokesperson, denied these charges, maintaining that Rwandan troops were being deployed only to prevent the conflict from spilling over into its territory. Meanwhile, Laurence noted the U.N. human rights office has received reports of conflict-related sexual violence committed by divergent groups, such as 'the army and allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory.' 'We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,' he said. 'Additionally, DRC officials report that at least 165 women were raped by male inmates during the prison break by more than 4,000 inmates from Goma’s Muzenze prison on 27 January, as M23 began its assault on the town.' The rights agency reported bombs struck at least two sites for internally displaced persons, causing civilian casualties. The agency documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between Sunday and Tuesday. The International Organization for Migration, or IOM, reports that several displacement sites in Goma and on the outskirts, where over 300,000 displaced persons have sought refuge, 'have been partially or completely emptied as families fled the fighting.' 'Millions of people were already displaced by years of conflict in eastern DRC, and humanitarian needs were massive,' Amy Pope, IOM director general said Friday. 'With the current alarming upsurge in fighting, an already dire situation is rapidly becoming very much worse.' Reports indicate that M23 has progressed farther south toward Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. In other areas under M23 control in South Kivu, such as Minova, M23 reportedly has occupied schools and hospitals, forced displaced people out of camps and subjected the civilian population to forced conscription and forced labor. Türk warned that the current widespread proliferation of weapons in Goma 'is exacerbating the already significant risks of serious violations and abuses.' 'We continue to receive urgent requests from civilians for protection and are working with U.N. colleagues and other partners to ensure their safety,' he said. Türk called for investigations into the commission of violations, stressing the importance of holding perpetrators to account.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-decries-sexual-violence-as-weapon-of-war-in-drc/7959490.html	2025-02-01T09:30:25-08:00	
Trump marks Black History Month while Pentagon declares 'identity months dead'	WASHINGTON — The Trump White House issued a proclamation Friday recognizing February as Black History Month around the same time the U.S. Defense Department issued guidance declaring 'identity months dead.' The conflicting messages came as President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs for removal in the first weeks of his administration. He has referred to DEI initiatives as 'discrimination' and insisted that the country must instead move toward a merit-based society. The White House proclamation calls for 'public officials, educators, librarians and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities,' though there is no elaboration on what constitutes 'appropriate.' A news release from the Defense Department titled 'Identity Months Dead at DOD' says official resources, including working hours, will no longer be used to mark cultural awareness months. Black History Month, Women's History Month and National Disability Employment Awareness Month were among the events listed as now barred. 'We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,' the Defense Department release read. In his first two weeks in office, Trump has moved to end affirmative action in federal contracting and directed that all federal DEI workers be put on paid leave before eventually being laid off. On Thursday, hours after a midair collision between a military helicopter and an American Airlines plane killed 67 people just miles from the White House, Trump baselessly blamed diversity initiatives for undermining air safety, despite no evidence of that. Gerald Ford in 1976 became the first president to issue a message recognizing February as Black History Month. Since then, presidents have made annual proclamations marking the month as a celebration of Black history, culture and education. Trump's proclamation Friday specifically noted the contributions of abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman, conservative economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. It said their achievements 'have monumentally advanced the tradition of equality under the law in our great country' and are a continued inspiration. The declaration also listed golfer Tiger Woods as an American great, saying he was among those who have 'pushed the boundaries of excellence in their respective fields, paving the way for others to follow.' 'This National Black History Month, as America prepares to enter a historic Golden Age,' the proclamation said, 'I want to extend my tremendous gratitude to black Americans for all they have done to bring us to this moment, and for the many future contributions they will make as we advance into a future of limitless possibility under my administration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-marks-black-history-month-while-pentagon-declares-identity-months-dead-/7959465.html	2025-02-01T08:48:19-08:00	
Paramilitary group attacks open market in Sudan, killing 54	CAIRO — An attack on an open market in the Sudanese city of Omdurman by a paramilitary group fighting the country's military killed 54 people and wounded many more, health authorities said Saturday. The attack by the Rapid Support Forces on the Sabrein Market also wounded at least 158 others, the Health Ministry said in a statement. It was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the escalated civil war that has wrecked the northeastern African country. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. Khalid al-Aleisir, minister of culture and government spokesperson, condemned the attack, saying that the casualties included many women and children. He also said the attack caused 'widespread destruction to private and public properties.' 'This criminal act adds to the bloody record of this militia,' he said in a statement. 'It constitutes a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.' Sudan’s Doctors Syndicate condemned the RSF’s attack. It said one shell hit meters from al-Naw hospital, which received most of the market casualties. It said most of the bodies taken to the hospital were of women and children, adding that the hospital has a significant shortage of medical teams, especially surgeons and nurses. The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities across the sprawling northeastern African country. Saturday's attack was the latest tragedy in the country’s brutal civil war. Last week, about 70 people were killed in a RSF attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in the western region of Darfur. The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, has forced millions to flee their homes and has left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. And the Biden administration had accused the RSF and its proxies of committing genocide in the war. In recent months the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capital’s sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces. The military also regained control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and the country's largest oil refinery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paramilitary-group-attacks-open-market-in-sudan-killing-54/7959426.html	2025-02-01T07:52:57-08:00	
Insurgent attack kills 18 soldiers in southwestern Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan said Saturday that at least 18 soldiers were killed in an overnight insurgent attack in southwestern Balochistan province, marking one of the deadliest days for security forces in recent months. A military statement said that the casualties occurred in the Kalat district Friday night, when 'terrorists attempted to establish roadblocks' in the area, and that security forces promptly responded to what was labeled 'a cowardly act of terrorism.' The military said at least 12 assailants were killed in the ensuing gun battles. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office in Islamabad said in a statement that he strongly condemned the attack on security forces. A series of security operations has been launched throughout Balochistan since the overnight attack, which killed at least 11 'terrorists' and destroyed their hideouts on Saturday, according to an army declaration. 'The sanitization operations will continue until perpetrators and facilitators of the heinous and cowardly act are brought to justice,' it said. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack. The BLA and several smaller separatist organizations operating in Balochistan claim they are fighting for the province’s independence and routinely target security forces as well as their installations in the natural resources-rich Pakistani region. Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have experienced a dramatic surge in militant attacks over the past couple of years, killing thousands of Pakistani security forces and civilians. In 2024 alone, military and law enforcement agencies collectively lost nearly 700 personnel in nationwide militant attacks, making it the deadliest year for government forces in a decade, according to official data and independent research reports. Pakistan’s Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, both bordering Afghanistan, have experienced much of the bloodshed. The outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, is mainly blamed or claims credit for attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistani officials allege that TTP and Baloch insurgents use sanctuaries on Afghan soil to orchestrate cross-border terrorist raids with the support of that country’s Islamist Taliban leaders. Taliban officials reject the allegations, saying they do not allow anyone to use Afghanistan to threaten neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/insurgent-attack-kills-18-soldiers-in-southwestern-pakistan/7959378.html	2025-02-01T06:53:39-08:00	
Russia says it is advancing toward flashpoint Ukrainian city	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia said on Saturday it had captured a village flanking the eastern flashpoint city of Toretsk in Ukraine as Kyiv said four people had died in overnight Russian strikes. The Russian Defense Ministry said its troops seized the village of Krymske in the northeastern suburbs of Toretsk, located in the eastern Donetsk region and the scene of intense fighting in recent months. The Russian army is slowly but steadily advancing in Donetsk, despite heavy human and material losses. On Tuesday, Ukrainian troops in the region said there was intense fighting in urban areas of Toretsk and Chasiv Yar, a strategically important military hub on the front line. DeepState, a group of Ukrainian military analysts, says Russian forces have been in the center of the two contested cities for months. 4 killed in Russian strikes Overnight, at least four people died in Russian strikes on the central Ukrainian city of Poltava and the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian authorities had issued air raid alerts for the entire country just before 7 a.m. Saturday, warning of missile and drone threats in several regions. Ukrainian emergency services said on Telegram a 'missile strike on a residential building' in Poltava had killed at least three people and wounded at least 13, three of them seriously. They published images showing firefighters searching through the smoldering ruins of a building. 'Russian terror' In Kharkiv, a Russian drone shot down by air defense fell on a residential area, killing a woman and injuring four other people, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. The Russian Defense Ministry said its overnight strikes had hit gas and energy infrastructure that supply Ukraine's 'military-industrial complexes.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attacks showed his country needed more defense systems to protect itself from 'Russian terror.' He said, 'Last night, Russia attacked our cities using various types of weapons: missiles, attack drones, air bombs. 'Every air defense system, every anti-missile is a lifesaver. It is very important that our partners act ... and increase pressure on Russia, ' Zelenskyy said, adding that damage had been reported in six regions — Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia. 2 killed in Ukrainian attack Earlier this week, Ukraine launched a major drone attack on western Russia, killing a child and his mother and setting a refinery on fire. The full Russian invasion of its neighbor enters its fourth year this month. U.S. President Donald Trump said during his election campaign he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office on Jan. 20. He has been critical of the amount Washington has spent arming Ukraine and has also threatened to impose additional sanctions on Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-it-is-advancing-toward-flashpoint-ukrainian-city/7959302.html	2025-02-01T04:24:52-08:00	
Myanmar scam operations move south along Thai border	BANGKOK — Myanmar’s scam operations are expanding south along Thailand’s border, authorities have told VOA in recent days, and will continue operating as long as their access to SIM cards, Starlink satellites, electricity and the key human resources — scammers — continues. The Myawaddy area in Myanmar, opposite the Thai border town of Mae Sot, is the 'global capital' of scams, opposition People’s Party lawmaker Rangsiman Rome told VOA on Wednesday. 'We are talking about an empire,' he said, estimating the number of scammers in at least 40 major compounds there at around 300,000. 'They have scammed more than the entire gross domestic product of some countries, and there is no end to their operations in sight,' said Rangsiman, who is chair of the House of Representatives Committee on National Security and Border Affairs. Powered by billions of dollars of illicit money from their scams, the crime bosses are already moving to new sites further south from Myawaddy along the Thai border, police, politicians and former scammers have told VOA. New scam bases have already been set up hundreds of kilometers south of Mae Sot, in border areas of Myanmar held by ethnic rebels across from Thailand’s Sangkhlaburi district, a security attaché at a Southeast Asian embassy in Bangkok who deals directly with scam victims told VOA, requesting anonymity. 'The scam compounds are expanding far south of Myawaddy,' the source said. A toxic mix of cross-border criminal interests, the protection of ethnic armed groups and Myanmar’s junta, has enabled the scam gangs to flourish, virtually in the open. 'What I’m most concerned with is about how Thai ‘grey money’ has operated as the wings for Chinese ‘grey money’ which makes enforcing the law even more impossible,' Rangsiman said, without elaborating on who he believes is backing the scam gangs. Billions in losses estimated A United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime report last year estimated losses of between $18 billion and $37 billion from scams across East and Southeast Asia in 2023 alone. The scam networks are mainly operated by Chinese criminals in China or elsewhere, using foreign nationals from around the world to carry out elaborate romance or investment scams, hunting for victims online or through cold calls. Many of them have been tricked into traveling to Thailand for well-paying jobs but are trafficked into Myanmar instead to work as scammers against their will. Last year Chinese authorities crossed into Myanmar and arrested over 50,000 of their nationals operating in scam factories along the eastern border with Yunnan province. New scam rooms are cropping up to the south, including along Myanmar’s border with Thailand’s Kachanburi province — Rangsiman pointed to the border along Thailand’s Phop Phra district, 35 kilometers south of Mae Sot, and Payathonzu, in Myanmar’s Karen state and across from Sangkhlaburi, 300 kilometers from Mae Sot. China’s deputy minister of public security, Liu Zhongyi, visited Mae Sot on Wednesday, a trip signaling Beijing’s prioritization of the scam issue in Myawaddy, according to Thai Police General Thatchai Pitanilabut, who is head of the Combat Call Center Crimes and Human Trafficking Task Force. 'Beijing is taking this matter very seriously,' he told reporters after the visit. As 'a transit route' to the scam rooms, Thailand needs to tackle the problem, as it is 'giving us a bad image as someone who is an accomplice to human trafficking for the call center gangs,' he said. Thai law enforcement authorities, which are working with the UNODC and other entities on the issue, have said they are committed to assisting and protecting victims of human trafficking as well as investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of call center crimes and human trafficking. The scrutiny comes after a flurry of high-profile rescues of Chinese citizens tricked into scamming in Myawaddy. They include actor Wang Xing, who was rescued in early January after his case went viral on social media. Thatchai said there are immediate measures Thailand can take to rein in the scam gangs. 'First and foremost, we must intercept and block all the supplies, including receivers, antennas, SIM boxes, and Starlink satellite internet dishes from leaving our borders,' he said, referring to the portable kits providing access to high-speed internet from Starlink, which have become essential tools for the scammers. Rangsiman confirmed the movement of scam centers further south and added that the Thai Interior Ministry, acting through its Provincial Electricity Authority, could cut the power into Myawaddy, which is under consideration, but is yet to do so. Questions are also being asked by foreign embassies about how vast numbers of foreigners from such disparate countries as Kenya and Japan have been able to cross a remote Thai border into Myanmar, seemingly without the knowledge of Thai authorities. It should be noted, though, that the Thai-Myanmar border is marked by the Moei River, which at some points can be as narrow as 10 meters. Three police chiefs in charge of three Mae Sot police stations were transferred from their roles this week pending a probe into failing to stop human trafficking into Myanmar. China holds the key to shutting down the Myawaddy scam base, said Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand’s former premier and a powerful tycoon whose daughter, Paetongtarn, is prime minister. 'China has major clout over Myanmar. We can’t speak to the Myanmar government directly … so we need China to help us,' he told reporters Thursday, referring to Myanmar’s post-coup junta. Trafficking victims or not With a crackdown seemingly imminent, human rights groups are urging Thailand to ensure foreigners tricked into working in the scam rooms are freed and treated as human trafficking victims. Others who have recently left Myawaddy scam rooms paint a more complex picture of the motives of some of the rank-and-file scammers. 'It’s in the news everywhere, social media, it’s impossible for them not to be aware,' a Filipino woman who voluntarily went into one of the most notorious scam rooms told VOA, requesting that her name not be used. 'It’s sad but true … money is the only reason, and it is luring people into work,' she said. The fear of a major Chinese-led crackdown has meant the scam bosses are now recruiting people who know what they are getting into rather than trafficking unsuspecting people, the woman said. 'The new ‘policy’ is that people need to be aware of what type of job they are taking on,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-scam-operations-move-south-along-thai-border/7959295.html	2025-02-01T04:07:19-08:00	
Democrats to elect leader as party struggles to regroup	OXON HILL, MARYLAND — Democrats, seeking a new message and messengers to push back against the Trump administration, will elect a new leader Saturday in a low-profile Democratic National Committee election that could have big implications for the party's future. More than 400 DNC members from every state and U.S. territory have gathered in suburban Washington for the election, which features a slate of candidates dominated by party insiders. Outgoing Chair Jaime Harrison is not seeking reelection. Most of the candidates acknowledge that the Democratic brand is badly damaged, but few are promising fundamental changes. Indeed, nearly three months after Donald Trump won the popular vote and gained ground among key Democratic constituencies, there is little agreement on what exactly went wrong. Facing an emboldened Trump presidency, however, the leading candidates are talking tough. 'As we reel with shock at the horror that Trump is visiting on communities across this country, we need a DNC and a DNC chair who’s ready to bring the intensity, the focus and the fury to fight back,' said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chair and a top candidate for DNC chair. The election comes less than two weeks after Trump's inauguration and as Democratic leaders struggle to confront the sheer volume of executive orders, pardons, personnel changes and controversial relationships taking shape in the new administration. The next DNC chair would serve as a face of the Democratic response, while helping to coordinate political strategy and repair the party's brand. Just 31% of voters have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week that offers a dramatic contrast with Trump's GOP. Forty-three percent of voters have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party. The leading candidates for DNC chair, Wisconsin's Wikler and Minnesota’s Ken Martin, are low-profile state party chairs. They're promising to refocus the Democratic message on working-class voters, strengthen Democratic infrastructure across the country and improve the party's anti-Trump rapid response system. They have promised not to shy away from the party's dedication to diversity and minority groups, a pillar of the modern-day Democratic Party. But if Martin, 51, or Wikler, 43, is elected, as expected, either would be the first white man to lead the DNC since 2011. Also in the race: Marianne Williamson, the activist and author; former Maryland governor and Biden administration official Martin O’Malley; and Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders’ last presidential campaign. Shakir has called for sweeping changes within the party, such as more coordination with labor unions and less focus on minority groups sorted by race and gender. The only Muslim seeking the chairmanship, Shakir was alone during a candidate forum this week in opposing the creation of a Muslim caucus at the DNC. But he has struggled to gain traction. Shakir declined to raise money for the contest, decorating his modest booth at this week's gathering with pictures drawn by his young children with crayons. By contrast, Martin and Wikler hosted would-be supporters in large hotel suites adorned with dozens of professionally printed signs and offered T-shirts, sunglasses and food. Wikler has faced questions about his relationship with Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, the billionaire cofounder of LinkedIn. But he cast his fundraising connections as an asset. Indeed, the DNC chair is expected to raise tens of millions of dollars to help Democrats win elections. Some Democratic leaders remain concerned about the direction of their party. 'As positive as I am and as hopeful as I am, I’m watching this in real time, thinking to myself, ‘We’re in real trouble because I don’t see a desire to change,’' said Kansas Democratic Chair Jeanna Repass, a candidate for DNC vice chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-to-elect-leader-as-party-struggles-to-regroup/7959286.html	2025-02-01T03:34:39-08:00	
Trump administration fires prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday fired a group of prosecutors involved in the Jan. 6 criminal cases and demanded the names of FBI agents involved in those same probes so they can possibly be ousted, moves that reflect a White House determination to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees seen as insufficiently loyal. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the firings of the Jan. 6 prosecutors days after President Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency action benefiting the more than 1,500 people charged in the U.S. Capitol attack, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. About two dozen employees at the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington were terminated, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel issues. A separate memo by Bove identified more than a half-dozen FBI senior executives who were ordered to retire or be fired by Monday, and also asked for the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot — a list the bureau’s acting director said could number in the thousands. Bove, who has defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would then carry out a 'review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.' 'As we’ve said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, we are going to follow the law, follow FBI policy, and do what’s in the best interest of the workforce and the American people — always,' acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll wrote in a letter to the workforce. The prosecutors fired in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office had been hired for temporary assignments to support the Jan. 6 cases but were moved into permanent roles after Trump’s presidential win in November, according to the memo obtained by the AP. Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, said he would not 'tolerate subversive personnel actions by the previous administration.' Any mass firings at the FBI would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation’s premier federal law enforcement agency but would be in keeping with Trump’s persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a broad termination by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump. The FBI Agents Association said the reported efforts to oust agents represented 'outrageous actions by acting officials' that were 'fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents.' 'Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau’s ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure,' the association said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses that protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge. When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI’s internal review processes for taking action against employees. Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that don’t follow that standard process, Patel said, 'I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.' Before he was nominated for the director’s position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about what he called anti-Trump 'conspirators' in the government and news media who he said needed to be rooted out. Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then replaced his second, Christopher Wray, just weeks after his win in November. Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: 'No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody’s never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.' He added, 'If they fired some people over there, that’s a good thing, because they were very bad.' The FBI and Smith’s team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump’s November presidential win because of longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. The Justice Department also charged more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, although Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments. This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and agents in charge of big-city field offices — have been told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-fires-prosecutors-involved-in-jan-6-cases/7959279.html	2025-02-01T03:11:02-08:00	
Trump moves to cancel recent union agreements with federal workers	Donald Trump said Friday that any collective bargaining agreements reached with federal workers within 30 days of his inauguration will not be approved, the latest salvo in the U.S. president's bid to remake the federal workforce. In a memo addressed to the heads of all executive departments and agencies, Trump said former U.S. President Joe Biden's administration purposefully finalized collective bargaining agreements with federal employees in its final days 'in an effort to harm my administration by extending its wasteful and failing policies beyond its time in office.' It was not immediately clear how many agreements would be affected by the new policy, which refers to them as 'lame-duck collective bargaining agreements.' Collective bargaining agreements are deals between unions and their employees that outline working conditions, pay and other policies. The move comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a massive makeover of the U.S. government, firing and sidelining hundreds of civil servants in his first steps toward downsizing the bureaucracy and installing more loyalists. The memo cites a U.S. Department of Education collective bargaining agreement reached three days before Trump took office that 'generally prohibits the agency from returning remote employees to their offices.' Trump has signed an executive order that would require federal employees to work in-office five days a week, reversing a remote working trend that took off in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-moves-to-cancel-recent-union-agreements-with-federal-workers/7959271.html	2025-02-01T02:40:44-08:00	
Hamas frees 3 hostages in latest ceasefire exchange with Israel	Hamas handed over three Israeli hostages Saturday, the latest in a series of exchanges agreed to in a deal aimed at ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, and Yarden Bibas, 35, were handed over to the Red Cross in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis before being returned to Israel. Israeli-American Keith Siegel, 65, was released hours later at the Gaza City seaport. Bibas was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel along with his wife, Shiri, and their two young boys, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2. The fate of his family is uncertain. Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. Aviva Siegel was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Kalderon was captured by the militants from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children. His ex-wife, Hadas Kalderon, was also taken captive but was released with their children during the 2023 hostage exchange. Israel had agreed to release 90 prisoners on Saturday, the fourth such exchange. But a Palestinian advocacy group said that number had been updated to 183, expected to be freed later in the day. Hamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, on Thursday. Later in the day, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. With the ceasefire deal in place, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza. The Israeli military ordered them out of the territory in the earliest stages of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. At a news conference Friday in Geneva, the U.N.’s World Food Program provided an update on efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Country Director Antoine Renard told reporters the agency has delivered more than 32,000 metric tons of food into Gaza since the ceasefire agreement began on Jan. 19. He said that amount was more than twice what was delivered in December and three times what was delivered in October. Renard said the WFP has reached 300,000 people so far. Meanwhile, during a visit to Lebanon on Friday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. Following talks with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Abdelatty told reporters, 'Egypt is very keen on confirming the need for a full and complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, without taking away a single inch of Lebanese sovereignty and territory.' Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal announced Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and the militant group Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by January 26. Like Hamas, Hezbollah is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Israeli forces have remained in more than a dozen villages past the deadline. The United States and Lebanon announced Sunday the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including airstrikes and shelling. They accuse Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. In statements posted to its social media accounts, the Israel Defense Forces reported overnight Thursday its fighter jets launched several attacks against what it said were Hezbollah targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which it said 'posed a threat to the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' The IDF statement said the targets included a military site 'with underground infrastructure for the development and production of weapons and transit infrastructure on the Syrian-Lebanon border' through which, the IDF said, Hezbollah was trying to transfer weapons. The IDF also reported Friday that its elite Sayeret Haruv fighting unit has, for the past nine days, been conducting an operation to 'thwart terrorism' in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. In a report on its website, the IDF said the fighters 'eliminated terrorists in clashes and made numerous arrests. They located weapons, exposed and destroyed more than five bomb laboratories.' The Sayeret Haruv unit specializes in operations in the West Bank as well as Gaza. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-frees-3-hostages-in-latest-ceasefire-exchange-with-israel/7959265.html	2025-02-01T02:09:06-08:00	
Mushers, dogs braved Alaska winter to deliver lifesaving serum 100 years ago	ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the 'strangling angel' for the way it suffocated children. Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors — the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver lifesaving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria. Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 'Great Race of Mercy' are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club. Alaskans honor 'heroic effort' 'There's a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,' said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska's oldest newspaper, The Nome Nugget. 'People just dropped whatever they were doing,' she said. 'These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.' Other communities are also marking the anniversary — including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum. Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team. A race to save lives Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film on the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S. Nome, western Alaska's largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn't seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area. Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: 'An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.' The first death was a 3-year-old boy on January 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine. West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle, Washington, and then onto a ship for Seward, Alaska, an ice-free port south of Anchorage, Alaska. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital. It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome. Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails. Thanks to Alaska's new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers — many of them Alaska Natives — with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn't see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus minus 51 degrees Celsius (60 degrees Fahrenheit). The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke. Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 320 kilometers (250 miles) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound. After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on February 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed 'Dogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.' The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It's likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked. Balto gains fame Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala's dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team. Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck. But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland, a city in Ohio. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Iditarod pays homage to run Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1. 'The Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska's pioneering spirit,' Noonan said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mushers-dogs-braved-alaska-winter-to-deliver-lifesaving-serum-100-years-ago-/7959204.html	2025-01-31T23:03:17-08:00	
What to know about the NTSB, the agency investigating the DC plane crash	WASHINGTON — A collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people brought renewed focus on the federal agency charged with investigating aviation disasters. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Hommendy has described the investigation into the crash as an 'all-hands-on-deck event' for the agency. Here are some things to know about the NTSB: What does the agency do? The NTSB is an independent federal agency responsible for investigating all civil aviation accidents as well as serious incidents in the U.S. involving other modes of transportation, such as railroad disasters and major accidents involving motor vehicles, marine vessels, pipelines and even commercial space operators. 'We're here to ensure the American people that we are going to leave no stone unturned in this investigation,' Homendy said, noting the probe is in the very early stages. 'We are going to conduct a thorough investigation of this entire tragedy, looking at the facts.' The agency has five board members who serve five-year terms and are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. How will the investigation work? For the investigation into Wednesday's crash, the NTSB will establish several different working groups, each responsible for investigating different areas connected to the accident, board member Todd Inman said. Inman said those groups include operations, which will examine flight history and crewmember duties; structures, which will document airframe wreckage and the accident scene; power plants, which will focus on aircraft engines and engine accessories; systems, which will study the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic components of the two aircraft; air traffic control, which will review flight track surveillance information, including radar, and controller-pilot communications; survival factors, which will analyze the injuries to the crew and passengers and crash and rescue efforts; and a helicopter group. The investigation also will include a human-performance group that will be a part of the operations, air traffic control and helicopter groups and will study the crew performance and any factors that could be involved such as human error, including fatigue, medications, medical histories, training and workload, Inman said. How long will the investigation take? NTSB officials did not say Thursday how long the investigation would take, but accident investigations often take between one to two years to complete. The agency typically releases a preliminary report within a few weeks of the accident that includes a synopsis of information collected at the scene. What is the NTSB's history? The NTSB history dates to 1926, when Congress passed a law charging the U.S. Department of Commerce with investigating aircraft accidents. It was established as an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1967 and then separated by Congress in 1974 as a stand-alone organization, fully independent from any other federal agencies. Since its creation in 1967, the agency reports it has investigated more than 153,000 aviation accidents and incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-the-ntsb-the-agency-investigating-the-dc-plane-crash/7959187.html	2025-01-31T23:02:33-08:00	
South African woman has rescued more than 2,500 pugs	JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA — Lots of hair shedding, tons of fun, and a constant invasion of your personal space. That's what you're going to get with a pug, according to Cheryl Gaw, who has seen more than a few of the squashed-nosed pups in her time. Gaw has rescued more than 2,500 pugs in South Africa over the years after she and her husband sold their house, lived in a trailer home for a while and generally reset their lives to help as many dogs in need as they could. They eventually established their Pug Rescue South Africa in Johannesburg in 2010 because of an overflowing number of dogs in their house. It was 'never part of the plan' when they looked ahead to their retirement, said Gaw, who is 63. 'Of course, the pugs won,' she added. The center is currently home to nearly 200 pugs, the latest batch who have hit hard times and need a helping paw. Some of them were abandoned, some sick, and many were given up by owners who couldn't look after them anymore. Gaw's pug life started in 2008 when her husband, Malcolm, gave her one as a gift. At a pug club, someone asked if they'd be interested in providing a foster home for 'a couple' of pugs. In the first year, the Gaws provided a temporary home to 60 pugs and had 19 in their home at one point — too much fur for one small house. 'They are known as the clowns of the dog world, and they can make you laugh,' said Gaw, giving her own breed guide. 'Always in your space. They're just an amazing, lovable breed. And you always have hair on you.' The rescue center's staff do their best to keep order. The routine is: 5:15 a.m., the dogs wake up and come out of the cottages where they sleep in groups according to their 'age and personality,' said Gaw. Then there's breakfast, medication for those who need it, bathtime, playtime, grooming time, midday snacks, afternoon rest, more playtime, evening meal, more medication, and all pugs back in their rooms between 6-7 p.m. Fights occasionally break out. The veterinary bill for the center is nearly $40,000 a year, and it's a constant process of rescue, rehabilitation, and trying to rehome them, with more pugs arriving all the time. 'The operation doesn't stop,' said Gaw. There is a reason why so many pugs need a new home. Their short muzzles, a mark of the breed, give rise to breathing problems and other health issues such as eye and ear infections, she said. A pug's vet costs are not to be sniffed at and Gaw warns prospective owners to do their homework and get a good pet insurance policy: 'You're going to need it.' Many of the pugs have come to the Gaws because their owners can't afford those vet bills. Be prepared for their problems, she said, and also the hair, which she can't stress enough. 'They shed an enormous amount of hair,' she said. 'You can brush them all day long, they still shed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---south-african-woman-has-rescued-more-than-2-500-pugs-/7957914.html	2025-01-31T23:01:54-08:00	
New Zealand mountain is granted personhood, recognizing it as sacred for Maori	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being. Mount Taranaki — now known as Taranaki Maunga, its Maori name — is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 2,518 meters and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports. The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain's theft from the Māori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since. How can a mountain be a person? The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te Kahui Tupua, which the law views as 'a living and indivisible whole.' It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, 'incorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.' A newly created entity will be 'the face and voice' of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local Maori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's conservation minister. Why is this mountain special? 'The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,' Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and Maori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday. But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont. In 1840, Maori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi — New Zealand's founding document — in which the Crown promised Maori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the Maori and English versions of the treaty differed — and Crown breaches of both began immediately. In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish Maori for rebelling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management — but Maori did not. 'Traditional Maori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,' Goldsmith said. But a Maori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the Maori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law. Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements — such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023. How will the mountain use its rights? 'Today, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,' said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te Pati Maori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain. 'We grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,' she added. The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain. Do other parts of New Zealand have personhood? New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe Tuhoe became its guardian. 'Te Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,' the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to Maori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi. How much support did the law receive? The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata — a Maori song — from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki. The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law — which is not expected to pass — would strip Maori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-mountain-is-granted-personhood-recognizing-it-as-sacred-for-m%c4%81ori/7957903.html	2025-01-31T23:01:11-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: Will China be marginalized by US involvement in Russia-Ukraine talks?	Over the past three years, despite accusations that China has provided covert support to Russia in the Ukraine war, Beijing has repeatedly emphasized its 'neutrality' in public and called for peace talks. However, with newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump joining the call for a ceasefire, Beijing's carefully crafted role as a 'peacemaker' may face the risk of marginalization.

Trump’s funding freeze hits program for Burmese students, scholars	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s decision to freeze $45 million in U.S. federal funding for over 400 Burmese students has left many in shock and dismay as their scholarships were abruptly canceled. The move has also raised concerns about the broader impact it could have on Burmese in Myanmar, a country already grappling with political turmoil and a collapsing education system under military rule. Students in limbo One Burmese student who studies at Chiang Mai University in Thailand told VOA that she feels completely lost after learning that her scholarship was being suspended. 'To be honest, I am lost because of this sudden loss of my scholarship. I had been studying with the goal of earning a degree, and now I don’t know what to do,' she said. The student spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because she fears for her safety if she returns to Burma, which remains under military control. She said students like her and others at different academic levels are now left without financial support. 'There are students doing four-year master’s degrees, others in four-year bachelor's programs, and even PhD students. I don’t know whether I should continue my studies, go home, or what my next step should be,' she said. 'I am saddened that President Trump only cares about the United States and has cut off my studies.' An email sent to recipients of the program that was shared with VOA’s Burmese Service, said the Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program, or DISP, is currently suspended, and officials 'will review whether to continue the scholarship for the students who have been awarded it.' DISP was created to support Burmese students from marginalized and underprivileged backgrounds, giving them opportunities to study at universities across Asia, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The program also provided funding for online education through the University of Arizona. For many, the initiative was their only chance to pursue higher education outside of Burma, where the junta-controlled education system has systematically restricted access for those opposing the military regime. For some students, the immediate impact has been less severe. Hlwan Paing Thi Ha, who has been studying at Chiang Mai University for a year, told VOA: 'My education has already been paid for through the scholarship program, so it hasn’t impacted me yet.' Future leaders impacted One source who has in-depth understanding of the program, said the impact goes beyond just access to education and opportunities. The source spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the media. More than a quarter of the Burmese students in the program have fled Myanmar due to the military coup, ongoing fighting and forced conscription, which has targeted youth. 'The impact is huge,' the source said, adding that currently, more than 400 Burmese students are attending universities in four countries—the Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand through the USAID-funded program. 'Of these, 110 were directly recruited from Myanmar, while the rest are students who fled to border regions and Southeast Asian countries due to the military coup or boycotted Myanmar’s junta-controlled education system,' the source said. The program, which was launched in February 2024, was designed as a five-year initiative, with plans to recruit three batches of students over that period. 'The goal was to ensure that at least 1,000 Burmese students, the 'current and future leaders of the country,' could continue their studies in universities across the region. The second batch, which would include hundreds of students, is now in the final stage of the screening process,' the source explained. Debate continues In Washington a debate over the freeze and review continues. On Tuesday, the State Department issued a waiver that exempts some humanitarian aid from the freeze. U.S. lawmakers have also voiced concerns, warning that the freeze will impact American soft power and give China an advantage. On Wednesday, President Trump defended the funding freeze, specifically calling out the $45 million allocated for diversity scholarships for Burmese students. 'We also blocked $45 million for diversity scholarships in Burma. Forty-five—that’s a lot of money for diversity scholarships in Burma. You can imagine where that money went,' Trump said. 'These were the types of payments and many others. I could stand here all day and tell you about things that we found, and we have to find them quickly because we want the money to flow to proper places.' Name threatens its demise? Some note that in addition to the freeze, the name of the program may also leave it in a difficult position, with some worrying that the mention of diversity in its title could impact a substantive review of its impact. The source with direct knowledge of the initiative for Burmese students told VOA that the program was swiftly terminated when the Trump administration began reducing foreign aid, and that its name 'Diversity and Inclusion' likely played a major role in its elimination. 'This program was one of the first to be cut as soon as the administration began making budget reductions in this area,' the source said. While all USAID-funded programs have been temporarily frozen, DISP appears to have been specifically blocked without any review, the source noted. 'USAID officials have not been able to explain why this program was halted so suddenly.' VOA reached out to the State Department to verify whether the program was permanently blocked or still under review and whether its name played a role in its swift termination. However, as of the time of publication, VOA had not received a response from the State Department. The source also voiced concern the administration may not understand that the program has no connection to Myanmar’s military junta and was created solely to support young people who lost their education due to military oppression. Lifeline for ethnic and religious minorities The Diversity and Inclusion Scholarship Program was set up to reflect Burma’s ethnic and religious diversity, giving equal opportunities to students from all backgrounds who have historically faced discrimination under the Burman-dominated and military-controlled education policies. Burman is the name of the main ethnic group in Myanmar. Many recipients of the scholarship program belong to ethnic minority groups such as the Karen, Kachin, Shan, Chin, and Rohingya, who have historically faced systemic discrimination in Burma’s education system.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-funding-freeze-hits-program-for-burmese-students-scholars/7959215.html	2025-01-31T19:34:23-08:00	
Health data, pages wiped from federal websites as Trump officials target 'gender ideology'	Public health data disappeared from websites, entire webpages went blank and employees erased pronouns from email signatures Friday as federal agencies scrambled to comply with a directive tied to President Donald Trump's order rolling back protections for transgender people. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip 'gender ideology' from websites, contracts and emails in a memo sent Wednesday, with changes ordered to be instituted by 5 p.m. Friday. It also directed agencies to disband employee resource groups, terminate grants and contracts related to the issue, and replace the term 'gender' with 'sex' on government forms. Some parts of government websites appeared with the message: 'The page you’re looking for was not found.' Some pages disappeared and came back intermittently. Asked by reporters Friday about reports that government websites were being shut down to eliminate mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump said he didn’t know anything about it but that he’d endorse such a move. 'I don’t know. That doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me,' Trump said, adding that he campaigned promising to stamp out such initiatives. Much public health information was taken down from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website: contraception guidance; a fact sheet about HIV and transgender people; lessons on building supportive school environments for transgender and nonbinary kids; details about National Transgender HIV Testing Day; a set of government surveys showing transgender students suffering higher rates of depression, drug use, bullying and other problems. Eliminating health resources creates dangerous gaps in scientific information, disease experts said. The Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association, issued a statement decrying the removal of information about HIV and people who are transgender. Access is 'critical to efforts to end the HIV epidemic,' the organization’s leaders said. A Bureau of Prisons web page originally titled 'Inmate Gender' was relabeled 'Inmate Sex' on Friday. A breakdown of transgender inmates in federal prisons was no longer included. The State Department on Friday removed the option to select 'X' as a gender on passport applications for nonbinary applicants. It also replaced the word 'gender' from the descriptor with the word 'sex.' All State Department employees were ordered to remove gender-specific pronouns from their email signatures. The directive, from the acting head of the Bureau of Management, said this was required to comply with Trump’s executive orders and that the department was also removing all references to 'gender ideology' from websites and internal documents. 'All employees are required to remove any gender identifying pronouns from email signature blocks by 5:00 PM today,' said the order from Tibor Nagy. 'Your cooperation is essential as we navigate these changes together.' An official from the U.S. Agency for International Development said staffers were directed to flag the use of the word 'gender' in each of thousands of award contracts. Warnings against gender discrimination are standard language in every such contract. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, under a Trump administration gag order prohibiting USAID staffers from speaking with people outside their agency. The official said staffers fear that programs and jobs related to inclusion efforts, gender issues and issues specific to women are being singled out and possibly targeted under two Trump executive orders. Some Census Bureau and National Park Service pages were also inaccessible or giving error messages. Trump's executive order, signed on his first day back in office, calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the military to immediately stop recognizing identity a day before the start of February's Black History Month, saying they 'erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-data-pages-wiped-from-federal-websites-as-trump-officials-target-gender-ideology-/7959210.html	2025-01-31T19:09:02-08:00

High-ranking member of Assad’s regime arrested in Syria	Syria’s new authorities have announced the arrest of Atif Najib, a former senior security officer and cousin of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. Najib is seen by many as being responsible for suppressing the initial protest which triggered Syria’s 2011 uprising. Najib was arrested in western Syria in the Latakia countryside, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported he 'was hiding in a farm.' He is the highest-ranking member of Assad’s government to be arrested since Assad was ousted from office in December. 'The criminal Atif Najib has been referred to the competent authorities to be tried and held accountable for the crimes he committed against the Syrian people,' the official SANA news agency reported, citing a senior security official. Najib was the head of political security in Daraa in southern Syria, under Assad’s regime. Syria’s nationwide uprising was sparked by the arrest and torture of children in Daraa, whom, the Observatory said had been arrested for 'writing sentences criticizing the regime on their school walls.' The protests in Daraa that followed the children’s arrests evolved into the 2011 uprising that Assad’s government responded to with a brutal crackdown. Ahmed al-Sharaa is Syria’s newly appointed transitional president. Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by him and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.

Small plane crashes in Pennsylvania, governor says	PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA — A small plane crashed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 30 seconds after it took off as crews responded to a fiery scene, Pennsylvania's governor said Friday. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said he is offering all 'Commonwealth resources as they respond to the small private plane crash in Northeast Philly.' The crash happened less than 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights. Photos taken at the crash site appear to show residential homes on fire. Philadelphia's emergency management office said there was a 'major incident' at the location of the crash site and that roads are closed in the area. Flight data showed a small jet taking off from the airport at 6:06 p.m. and disappearing from radar about 30 seconds later after climbing to an altitude of 487 meters (1,600 feet). A photo posted on the social platform X by the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management showed a thick cloud of smoke in the sky near the Roosevelt Mall, where first responders were blocking traffic and onlookers crowded onto a street corner. The plane crashed in a busy intersection near Roosevelt Mall, an outdoor shopping center with dozens of stores and restaurants in the residential neighborhood of Rhawnhurst. The Federal Aviation Administration said two people were aboard the plane, which was a Learjet 55. The plane, a small, business-type jet, was en route to Springfield, Missouri. The plane appeared to be a medical transport jet. The plane that took off and quickly disappeared from radar was registered to a company operating as Med Jets. The FAA said the National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation. The NTSB, which investigates air crashes, said it was gathering information about the crash.	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-plane-crashes-in-pennsylvania-governor-says-/7959165.html	2025-01-31T17:49:11-08:00	
‘Black box' recovered from helicopter involved in Washington midair collision	U.S. investigators say the 'black box' recorder from an Army Black Hawk helicopter was recovered Friday, as teams continue to search for clues into the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington. The Army helicopter and a commercial passenger jet collided late Wednesday as the jet was attempting to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Investigators said Friday evening that they are reviewing the flight data recorder along with two from the plane that they found Thursday as they try to understand what caused the crash over the Potomac River. National Transportation Safety Board member J. Todd Inman told reporters Friday the helicopter’s recorder appeared to be intact. 'We saw no exterior damage that would indicate it was compromised at this time, so we have a high level of confidence we’ll have a full extraction,' he said. The NTSB is the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials say there were no survivors. Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that 41 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage. Authorities said that they would likely be unable to extricate more victims from the plane without heavier equipment. Inman said that barges from Virginia Beach will arrive Saturday to begin more extensive salvage operations. He said rescue workers will also make sure that the victims are recovered. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that most helicopters would not be allowed to travel through and near Reagan National Airport for the time being. He wrote on social media platform X, 'Today’s decision will immediately help secure the airspace near Reagan Airport, ensuring the safety of airplane and helicopter traffic.' Speaking Friday before the helicopter’s black box was found, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the recorder would likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. He said Thursday that the helicopter crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training, and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary said the black box also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Hegseth also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. President Donald Trump said Friday that the Army helicopter was flying too high at the time of the crash. 'It was far above the 200 foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' Trump said in a Friday morning post on his Truth Social platform. Citing a government report, The Washington Post reported Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle both airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. At a news conference Thursday, both Virginia U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but that they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/black-box-recovered-from-helicopter-involved-in-washington-midair-collision-/7959169.html	2025-01-31T17:34:05-08:00	
Venezuela frees 6 Americans after meeting between Maduro, Trump envoy	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela in recent months were freed by the government of President Nicolas Maduro after he met Friday with a senior Trump administration official. U.S. President Donald Trump and his envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, announced the release of the six men on social media. Grenell posted on X a photo showing him and the men aboard an aircraft. Grenell's trip to Venezuela, according to the White House, was focused on Trump's efforts to deport Venezuelans back to their home country, which currently does not accept them, and on the release of the detained Americans. 'We are wheels up and headed home with these 6 American citizens,' Grenell wrote on X. 'They just spoke to @realDonaldTrump and they couldn't stop thanking him.' The visit by Grenell came as a shock to many Venezuelans who hoped that Trump would continue the 'maximum pressure' campaign he pursued against the authoritarian Venezuelan leader during his first term. Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's special envoy to Latin America, previewed Grenell's visit to Caracas in a conference call with journalists on Friday. He said Grenell, who served as U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, was in Venezuela on a 'very specific mission' that in no way detracts from the Trump administration's goal of restoring democracy in the South American nation. 'I would urge the Maduro government, the Maduro regime in Venezuela, to heed special envoy Ric Grenell's message,' said Claver-Carone, himself a former top national security aide to Trump during his first administration. 'Ultimately there will be consequences otherwise.' The visit comes less than a month after Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election by a more than 2-to-1 margin. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro's claim to victory. Venezuelan state television aired footage of Grenell and Maduro speaking in the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, the capital, and said the meeting had been requested by the U.S. government. Signing an executive order in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was asked if Grenell being filmed meeting with Maduro lent legitimacy to an administration that the Trump White House hasn't official recognized. 'No. We want to do something with Venezuela. I've been a very big opponent of Venezuela and Maduro,' Trump responded. 'They've treated us not so good, but they've treated, more importantly, the Venezuelan people, very badly.' Some Republicans criticized the visit. 'This is terrible timing,' said Elliott Abrams, who served as special envoy to Venezuela and Iran during the first Trump administration. 'A meeting with Maduro will be used by him to legitimize his rule and show that the Americans recognize him as president. If the purpose is to deliver a tough message about migration issues, the president could've done that himself. There was no need to send someone to Caracas.' Among those detained are as many as 10 Americans. Neither the White House nor Maduro's government immediately released the names of the six who were freed Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-frees-6-americans-after-meeting-between-maduro-trump-envoy/7959164.html	2025-01-31T17:23:03-08:00	
Mozambique urges refugees in Malawi to return home	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Mozambican authorities have assured thousands of refugees who fled to Malawi following the recent post-election unrest that peace has been restored in their country and that they are welcome to return home. Officials from Mozambique's Institute of Disaster Management Affairs made the comment Friday during a visit to the Nyamithuthu refugee camp in Nsanje district, which hosts asylum seekers from Mozambique. Luisa Celma Meque, the head of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique, thanked the Malawi government for taking care of asylum-seekers from her country. 'On behalf of our President Daniel Francisco Chapo, we are sending our message of thanks from the government of Mozambique, and we recognize all the effort of the government of Malawi,' said Meque. 'The second message is for our brothers here. We are doing all efforts necessary for them to return home as soon as possible' Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. Hilda Katema Kausiwa, the senior administrative and operations manager for the Department of Refugees in Malawi, said the screening and registration of refugees continues. 'Today, as the Department of Refugees, we have registered a total of 3,640 households, representing 7,456 people,' said Kausiwa. 'As of yesterday, we had finished registration in Mwanza, Neno as well as Mulanje [districts] which were additional sites that we had not gone to screen and register together with immigration [officers].' Kausiwa said her department has received no new asylum-seekers from Mozambique so far. Meque of the Institute of Disaster Management Affairs in Mozambique said peace has returned to the country. Malawian authorities said they are struggling to provide for refugees because the situation comes at a time when more than a quarter of Malawi's 20 million people face food shortages due to an El Nino-induced drought. However, during the visit, the Mozambican delegation donated food to the refugees. Kausiwa of the Department of Refugees in Malawi, appreciated the donation. 'And in the package, there is some rice, maize flour, salt and some beans,' said Kausiwa. 'These are critical foods that can be provided to the community noting that food has been a challenge since these people started coming.' But Mozambican traditional leader Reymond Commando of the Mulili area said the refugees would only return if there was concrete proof of their safety. He said they fled to Malawi to escape being killed and chased from their homes 'like animals.' Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, said in December that more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-urges-refugees-in-malawi-to-return-home/7959157.html	2025-01-31T17:18:57-08:00	
UN: After taking Goma, M23 rebels head to Congo's Bukavu	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations' peacekeeping chief said Friday that M23 rebels are advancing south toward the provincial capital of Bukavu after seizing control of Goma in the mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this week. 'The information I have is that M23/RDF are about 60 kilometers north of Bukavu. They seem to be moving quite fast,' Jean Pierre Lacroix told reporters of the rebels who are backed by the Rwandan Defense Forces. 'There is an airport in the vicinity of where they are, I think a few kilometers south, which is Kavumu.' He said if they succeed in taking over the airport as they did in Goma, it would be another 'significant step.' Congolese military bases in Bukavu were being emptied on Thursday to reinforce positions along the route to the provincial capital, residents told The Associated Press. Reuters reports that officials in Bukavu have also been recruiting civilians to help protect the city. Rwanda did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the latest military movements. Rebels take over schools, hospitals Earlier this month, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in along the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the support of the Rwandan army. Rwanda has denied accusations that it supports the rebels, whom the Congolese government has designated as a terrorist group. Until June, the United Nations had peacekeepers deployed in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province. The U.N. made an agreement with the government to gradually begin drawing down its mission, known as MONUSCO, and closed its Bukavu office. In areas under M23 control in South Kivu, including the key trading town of Minova, the rebels have occupied schools and hospitals, expelled displaced persons from camps, and forced the local population to fight for them and perform forced labor, the U.N. office of human rights said Friday. The U.N. peacekeeping chief, echoing the secretary-general and the Security Council, urged diplomatic engagement to halt the fighting and lead to a political solution. Goma still 'tense,' some services restored Meanwhile, in the North Kivu provincial capital of Goma, which fell to the rebels earlier this week, the situation is 'tense and volatile,' Lacroix said, but calm is gradually being restored, along with some basic services. U.N. peacekeepers have also been able to resupply some of their positions, he said. The airport, however, remains out of commission after sustaining heavy damage to its runways. The World Health Organization and the Congolese government assessed that 700 people had been killed between Sunday and Thursday, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Another 2,800 wounded are receiving treatment in health facilities. 'These numbers are expected to rise as more information becomes available,' Dujarric said. The International Organization for Migration said 300,000 people had been sheltering in displacement sites, including on the outskirts of Goma. Those sites are now mostly empty as people fled the fighting. The agency says the displaced urgently need food, shelter, clean water, medical care and protection. Before the latest round of violence, eastern Congo was mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country's valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-after-taking-goma-m23-rebels-head-toward-bukavu-congo/7958949.html	2025-01-31T16:37:07-08:00	
Why the Arctic matters in the 21st century	The Arctic is one of the coldest and least populated regions on Earth, much of it covered by ice. But in recent years it has become one of the most important sites of geopolitical tensions — and a key focus of American policy. Despite its inhospitability, land north of the Arctic Circle has long been inhabited by Indigenous people like the Inuit, Sami and Yukaghir and today includes territories belonging to eight countries: Canada, Russia, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the United States. In 1996, these countries formed the Arctic Council — a forum that includes all eight countries as member states along with representatives from Indigenous groups. But while the Arctic was once envisioned as a neutral zone where research and conservation could promote deeper international cooperation, multiple developments since then have turned it into a site of competition. The number one issue facing the Arctic is climate change. Since the 1990s, Arctic sea ice has declined by 7.6 trillion metric tons, with the rate of loss increasing by 57%. Besides contributing to rising sea levels, the loss of ice also reduces global solar reflection. This creates a feedback loop as the darker ocean water absorbs more heat, causing more ice to melt, adversely affecting global weather patterns. The melting of Arctic ice also directly affects local wildlife, with polar bear populations projected to decline by two-thirds in the next quarter-century as they lose their hunting grounds. But where some see environmental disaster, others see opportunity. The melting ice is making Arctic trade routes more navigable, providing shorter distances for transoceanic shipping than current lanes using the Suez and Panama canals. Furthermore, increased navigability is expanding potential for exploration and extraction of natural resources. The Arctic region is estimated to hold over 20% of the world’s remaining fossil fuel reserves, with over 400 oil and gas fields already discovered. Both the seabed and offshore areas also hold vast quantities of minerals ranging from staple commodities like iron, gold, nickel and zinc to rare earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are used in electronics and battery technology. Even traditional subsistence activity may be greatly altered and expanded as global warming leads fish stocks to migrate north and more coastal land becomes available for agriculture. Yet economic opportunities in the Arctic are emerging at a time of increased geopolitical tensions, as countries scramble to secure resources, stake territorial claims and develop facilities. With 53% of the Arctic coastline under its control, Russia has the largest presence in the region in terms of civilian ports like Murmansk and Arkhangelsk as well as multiple airfields and military bases along its northern border. More recently, Russia has moved to expand its claims to the Arctic seabed at the same time that its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has led other members of the Arctic Council to suspend cooperation with Moscow. While land jurisdiction in the Arctic is largely settled aside from a few small disputes, maritime claims are much more complex. Control over Arctic waters is generally governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines multiple types of territorial waters where a nation may have the right to restrict the activity of foreign vessels. These range from internal waters that are considered part of a nation’s sovereign territory to exclusive economic zones where foreign ships may travel freely but cannot extract resources. Although the United States played a formative role in negotiating the treaty and abides by most of its provisions, it remains one of the few countries that has not formally acceded to it because of concerns about limitations it places on seabed mining. Even among UNCLOS signatories, however, boundary definitions can vary. While Canada considers parts of the Northwest Passage to lie within its territorial waters, for example, most other nations including the United States consider it to be an international strait where foreign ships may transit. Similarly, Russia has claimed parts of the Northeast Passage along its northern coastline as internal waters, moving to restrict the right of passage in areas where it was previously allowed. Given these disputes, the Transpolar Sea Route through the center of the Arctic Ocean, which lies fully in international waters, will become more attractive as polar ice continues to thaw. The increasing importance of the Arctic has attracted the attention of other powers without Arctic territory. Several of these states have been admitted as observers in the Arctic Council, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. China, which is also an observer, has unilaterally declared itself as a 'near-Arctic state' and has expanded both research and commercial activity in the region by partnering with Russia as well as investing in infrastructure in Norway, Iceland and Greenland. China’s increased presence in the Arctic alongside Russia’s more aggressive posture have been among the reasons cited for U.S. President Donald Trump’s insistence on annexing or buying Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Greenland already contains a U.S. military base on its northwest coast, the discussion is likely to result in a further militarization of the territory, even under Denmark. Satellites are also expected to play a major role in exerting control within the Arctic, given the importance of observation and monitoring in remote areas with poor communications infrastructure. What was once considered a frozen frontier with little to offer is quickly becoming one of the most contested regions on Earth. And as the planet heats up, competition in the Arctic will as well.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-the-arctic-matters-in-the-21st-century-/7958931.html	2025-01-31T15:47:38-08:00	
Trump administration moving to fire FBI agents involved in investigations of Trump, AP sources say	WASHINGTON — Trump administration officials are moving to fire at least some of the FBI agents engaged in investigations involving President Donald Trump, two people familiar with the plans said Friday. It was not clear how many agents might be affected, though scores of investigators were involved in various inquiries touching Trump. Officials acting at the direction of the administration have been working to identify individual employees who participated in politically sensitive investigations for possible termination, said the people who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. A third person familiar with the situation said U.S. attorneys were instructed on a call this week to provide the names of prosecutors and agents who had any involvement in the hundreds of cases against the rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It was not made clear on the call why the names were needed, said the person, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Any mass firings would be a major blow to the historic independence from the White House of the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency and would reflect Trump's persistent resolve to bend the law enforcement and intelligence community to his will. It would be part of a startling pattern of retribution waged on federal government employees, following the forced ousters of a group of senior FBI executives earlier this week as well as a mass firing by the Justice Department of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team who investigated Trump. The FBI Agents Association said the planned firings are 'outrageous actions' that 'are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI agents.' 'Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure,' the association said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what recourse any fired agent might take, but the bureau has a well-defined process for terminations and any abrupt action that bypasses the protocol could presumably open the door to a legal challenge. When pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, said he was not aware of any plans to terminate or otherwise punish FBI employees who were involved in the Trump investigations. Patel said if he was confirmed he would follow the FBI's internal review processes for taking action against employees. Asked by Democratic Senator Cory Booker whether he would reverse any decisions before his confirmation that didn't follow that standard process, Patel said, 'I don't know what's going on right now over there, but I'm committed to you, Senator, and your colleagues, that I will honor the due process of the FBI.' Before he was nominated for the director's position, Patel had remarked on at least one podcast appearance about the existence of what he called anti-Trump 'conspirators' in the government and news media. Trump has for years expressed fury at the FBI and Justice Department over investigations that shadowed his presidency, including an inquiry into ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign, and continued over the last four years. He fired one FBI director, James Comey, amid the Russia investigation and then said he would fire his second, Christopher Wray. Wray later resigned before Trump took office Jan. 20. Asked at the White House on Friday if he had anything to do with the scrutiny of the agents, he said: 'No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody's never seen before. They came after a lot of people — like me — but they came after a lot of people.' He added, 'If they fired some people over there, that's a good thing, because they were very bad.' The FBI and Smith's team investigated Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both of those cases resulted in indictments that were withdrawn after Trump's November presidential win because of long-standing Justice Department policy prohibiting the federal prosecution of a sitting president. The Justice Department also brought charges against more than 1,500 Trump supporters in connection with the Capitol riot, though Trump on his first day in office granted clemency to all of them — including the ones convicted of violent crimes — through pardons, sentence commutations and dismissals of indictments. This week, the Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on Smith investigations, and a group of senior FBI executives — including several executive assistant directors and leaders of big-city field offices — were told to either resign or retire or be fired Monday. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. The firings would be done over the will of acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, who has indicated that he objects to the idea, the people said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-moving-to-fire-fbi-agents-involved-in-investigations-of-trump-ap-sources-say/7958928.html	2025-01-31T15:40:15-08:00	
Southern African leaders seek meeting with East African leaders over DRC crisis	MOUNT HAMPDEN, ZIMBABWE — Leaders from the Southern African Development Community met Friday in Zimbabwe to discuss the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo between the government and M23 rebels. The 16-nation bloc, which includes DRC, resolved to meet with its East African counterpart — the East Africa Community — about the matter. Elias Magosi, executive secretary of the 16-nation SADC, would engage with 'state and nonstate parties to the conflict on a ceasefire process to protect lives and facilitate a smooth flow of humanitarian support.' Magosi said the M23 rebels fighting the DRC army were backed by the Rwanda Defense Force — an allegation that Kigali has repeatedly denied. The United Nations and the United States classify M23 as armed rebels, while Kinshasa designates it as a terrorist group. DRC is a member of the SADC and the East Africa Community, or EAC, while Rwanda is an EAC member. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is the chairman of the SADC, said, 'I am confident that the concrete decisions adopted today will further propel forward the joint ongoing efforts to finding lasting solutions to restore peace and normalcy in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.' ‘Dire humanitarian crisis’ Dr. Francis Akili, a health project manager of Action Sante, a humanitarian nongovernmental organization operating in eastern DRC, told VOA of a 'dire humanitarian' crisis in areas around Goma, the capital and the largest city of the region's North Kivu province. He said the region faces a severe lack of food, water and electricity, exacerbating an already critical situation. 'We call on SADC, the EAC and the international community to take concrete and decisive actions to restore stability,' he said. 'The people of eastern Congo have suffered for too long.' In a video posted Friday on a U.N. website, U.N. Human Rights spokesperson Jeremy Laurence warned that the crisis continues to deepen following M23’s takeover of Goma. 'Since the start of the crisis, bombs have struck at least two IDP [internally displaced person] sites, causing civilian casualties,' he said. 'We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between the 26th and the 28th of January. Our office has also documented cases of conflict-related sexual violence by the army and the allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory. We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,' Laurence said. DRC President Felix Tshisekedi did not attend an EAC meeting earlier in the week. He did not attend Friday's SADC meeting, either, but was said to be following it online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-african-leaders-seek-meeting-with-east-african-leaders-over-drc-crisis/7959359.html	2025-01-31T15:30:52-08:00	
Consumers brace for impact of China tariffs	washington — White House press secretary Karoline Levitt announced Friday that President Donald Trump would be implementing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods and a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on Saturday. Consumers told VOA they were bracing for the possible impact of increased costs. 'I’m concerned about rising prices,' Yon Bui, a student of music and computer science at Middlebury College in Vermont, said in an interview Thursday. Bui said that while it might still be too early to tell what the impact could be, she has been considering purchasing costly items, such as expensive cosmetics that she buys sometimes, from China. She also said she needed a new phone. Bui said she would 'buy products now before they go up in price to a point where they’d become unaffordable.' Sean Liu, who lives in Virginia, told VOA that he was glad he'd recently decided to buy a new phone and car. 'With things that are already really expensive, if you add another 10% to their price – it's not like, say, buying a thermos and adding another 10% – this kind of price hike is truly big,' he said. He did add, though, that it might be a little easier to deal with if the tariffs came alongside lower prices for more basic necessities like groceries and gas. ‘One very big power’ On the campaign trail, Trump threatened tariffs as high as 60% on China. Since taking office, those threats have expanded and include everything from a universal tariff to threats against trade partners and rivals such as China and Russia. Last week, Trump threatened Colombia with tariffs of 25% to 50% to get Bogota to accept deportation flights. On China, Trump recently told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that tariffs were the 'one very big power' the U.S. has over China. 'They don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it,' Trump said. The 10% tariff on all Chinese imports is part of what Trump says is a punitive response to China’s role in manufacturing precursor chemicals essential to fentanyl production in Mexico. Currently, the United States targets China with a 100% tariff on electric vehicles, a 50% tariff on solar cells and semiconductors, a 25% tariff on critical minerals needed to make certain advanced batteries and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. New tariffs would build on more than $300 billion worth of taxes on Chinese imports that Trump imposed during his first term. Those tariffs were upheld and, in some cases, advanced under former President Joe Biden. Who will feel impact? Some analysts question who will be hurt if these tariffs are implemented. Some say the deep economic ties between China and the United States could mean that American consumers will be the ones bearing the brunt of Trump’s punishment on Beijing. Supporters, however, see the move as a fulfillment of Trump’s promise to put American lives and livelihoods first — particularly when it comes to stopping the flow of fentanyl into the country. According to William Reinsch, senior adviser of the economics program and Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the tariff likely would raise prices of goods in America. 'The prices on a lot of things that people buy at retail — apparel, footwear, household goods – things like that will be affected. Ten percent is not huge, but it's not zero either,' Reinsch said. Costs and benefits Trump has pushed back against the argument that tariffs drive inflation higher and said instead that tariffs would make America rich. Liu Longzhu, a California lawyer and delegate at the 2024 Republican National Convention, sees tariffs as the key to recovering America’s economic strength. 'The main purpose of increasing tariffs is to assure that America is truly ‘America First’ and protect American jobs. If you are looking for a job, they are beneficial to you. If the tariffs are increased, Chinese products will lose their competitiveness, and American products will become more competitive. This will make it easier for Americans to find jobs,' Liu said. James Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, doesn’t see tariffs as inherently inflationary, and he agrees that tariffs would bring back jobs that were lost to overseas companies. 'A tariff strategy can be implemented in such a way that the cost largely falls outside of the country,' Galbraith told VOA. But Stephen Lamar, president and CEO at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said that tariffs, especially those levied on China, will ultimately raise the cost of both domestic and foreign goods given the interconnectivity of global economies. 'The theory on paper is that you're giving domestic producers an advantage. The reality in practice is that more people are paying higher prices for products, regardless of their source,' Lamar told VOA. Reinsch also cast doubt on the ability of tariffs to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like apparel or footwear. 'I would be surprised if you see a renaissance in the American apparel industry as a result of a 10% tariff. It would take a lot more than that,' Reinsch said, adding that tariffs don’t guarantee a move away from imports and toward domestic manufacturing. Importers looking for cheap products can still source from countries in Southeast Asia or Africa that provide competitive, low-cost alternatives to Chinese products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/consumers-brace-for-impact-of-china-tariffs/7958898.html	2025-01-31T15:03:45-08:00

US deportations to China continue amid shifts in immigration crackdown	The Trump administration has confirmed that the deportation of Chinese nationals is still underway as part of a broader effort to enforce U.S. immigration laws. In an emailed response to VOA this week, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official wrote that the agency is removing from the United States any immigrant who is here unlawfully. 'ICE continues to conduct removals to the People’s Republic of China. Due to operational security, ICE does not confirm future removal operations until deportees have been returned to their country of origin,' the ICE official said Tuesday, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous. VOA requested the most recent removal numbers for China and an update on deportation flights, but as of Friday, ICE had yet to respond. Deportations have increased as China signals a greater willingness to repatriate its citizens, a departure from its historically restrictive stance. Large repatriation flights resumed last June, the first since 2018. On Jan. 6, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through ICE, conducted the Biden administration’s fifth removal flight to China in less than seven months. 'These [Biden administration] flights were the product of sustained cooperation between the Department and PRC counterparts to repatriate individuals who have not established a legal basis to remain in the United States,' DHS said in a statement on Jan. 10. Fast-track deportations Under the Trump administration, the approach is shifting toward making deportations faster and bypassing judicial review. The Trump administration issued an executive order on Jan. 21 to expand expedited removal, also known as fast-track deportations, to include immigrants who cannot prove they have been continuously living in the United States for more than two years. 'The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,' the notice read. Expedited removal allows the U.S. government to quickly deport people who are undocumented. Under the process of expedited removal, some noncitizens can be deported in a single day without an immigration court hearing or other appearance before a judge. ICE data from November showed 37,908 Chinese nationals who were believed to be removable from the United States but had not yet been detained. December and January numbers are not yet available. On Jan. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the expansion of expedited removal. The ACLU argued in court documents that the new rule violates federal law and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause by effectively eliminating full court hearings that immigrants are entitled to receive. The organization also cited studies indicating that expedited removals are prone to errors, often leading to the mistaken deportation of immigrants. Joanna Derman, a program director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told VOA that advocates are worried the Trump administration will use 'extreme options' to specifically target Chinese nationals for deportation, 'especially in the event of a significant escalation between the United States and China.' 'But on the other hand,' she said, 'we're also rapidly mobilizing right now. … We are uplifting resources for people who are the most likely to be impacted. The most vulnerable folks need to know what to do if [or] when ICE shows up at their school, their work or their place of worship.' US-China repatriation cooperation For years, China has been among the countries that refused or delayed accepting deportees, complicating U.S. efforts to remove individuals with final orders. Countries that do not negotiate or refuse to accept their nationals back are deemed 'recalcitrant' or 'uncooperative.' Recalcitrant countries do not accept their nationals back. Uncooperative countries will accept some of their nationals back. According to an ICE official and a DHS removal operations document, 15 countries were deemed to be uncooperative: Bhutan, Burma, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Laos, Pakistan, the People’s Republic of China, Russia, Somalia and Venezuela. ICE considers these to be at risk of recalcitrant: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Gabon, Gambia, Iraq, Jamaica, Nicaragua, South Sudan, St. Lucia and Vietnam. During a Monday press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked if Beijing intended to accept all Chinese nationals in the U.S. illegally. 'I’d refer you to competent authorities for anything specific,' she said. 'Let me say more broadly that the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of illegal migration. We have conducted practical cooperation with the migration and law enforcement departments of the U.S. and other countries, which has been productive. As far as repatriation is concerned, China’s principle is to receive the repatriates who are confirmed as Chinese nationals from the Chinese mainland after verification.' ICE’s deportation numbers reflect U.S. diplomatic efforts with China, with DHS reporting the removal of 109 Chinese nationals on the latest charter flight as of November, following 131 deportations in October and 116 in June. According to DHS, the Biden administration’s increase in deportations matches China’s work to decrease illegal immigration, which has led to a 62% decline in Chinese migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Apprehensions of Chinese dropped from 2,198 encounters in June 2024 to 873 in December 2024. January numbers are not yet available. Deportation logistics, cost An ICE official confirmed to VOA by email in late December that the U.S. government buys the commercial airline tickets for deportees, working closely with a travel service provider to book the most cost-effective flights. ICE determines whether to use charter or commercial flights based on operational needs. ICE did not share cost per person for either type of flight. But the American Immigration Council estimates that removing 1 million people a year would cost U.S. taxpayers about $88 billion, with the total over a decade approaching $1 trillion. Despite Beijing’s increased cooperation, China remains one of several nations that usually refuse to take back their citizens or delay repatriations. During the 2024 fiscal year, ICE removed 517 Chinese nationals from the United States. Deportation process In immigration court, deportation orders are usually issued after a foreign national violates the terms of a visa, is found to be undocumented or is convicted of a crime. When the United States seeks to deport an immigrant, it generally follows a framework negotiated with the other nation; these frameworks are often detailed in writing, through a memorandum of understanding. Before the United States can deport someone, the other country must agree to receive the deportee. There must also be an administratively final order of removal, or deportation order, and the individual must have a travel document issued by a foreign government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-deportations-to-china-continue-amid-shifts-in-immigration-crackdown/7958862.html	2025-01-31T14:06:33-08:00	
RFK Jr. vows to stop collecting from vaccine lawsuit if confirmed to Cabinet	WASHINGTON — Facing intense scrutiny from U.S. senators over his potential profit from vaccine lawsuits while serving as the nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that if he is confirmed he will not collect fees from litigation against the drugmakers of a cervical cancer vaccine. Kennedy, who's President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, told the Senate finance committee that he would amend his ethics disclosure after several senators, including Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and his cousin Caroline Kennedy raised concerns about his financial arrangement with the law firm representing patients who are claiming injuries from the vaccines. 'An amendment to my Ethics Agreement is in process, and it provides that I will divest my interest in this litigation,' Kennedy said in a written response to the committee. Initially, Kennedy had told the committee that he would continue to accept referral fees in legal cases that don't involve the U.S. government. That included an arrangement with a law firm that's sued Merck over Gardasil, its human papillomavirus vaccine that prevents cervical cancer. The deal earned Kennedy $850,000 last year, and he told senators he had referred hundreds of clients to the firm. During Wednesday's hearing, Warren outlined several ways in which Kennedy could make it easier to sue vaccine manufacturers. 'Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,' Warren said. 'Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.' The issue also may have been a concern for Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is also a physician and is conflicted over his vote on Kennedy's confirmation because of Kennedy's anti-vaccine views. The Republican president's nominee is 'financially vested in finding fault with vaccines,' Cassidy, the chair of the health committee, noted as he ended Thursday's confirmation hearing. Kennedy also stopped short of making other commitments, refusing to promise that he would not engage in lobbying Health and Human Services after his term ends. Kennedy and his supporters have railed against that sort of activity, saying the 'revolving door' of Washington — where federal officials trade public service jobs to influence government agencies while in the private sector — has undermined the U.S. public health system. He has criticized the practice at least a half-dozen times in social media posts over recent years. Kennedy, who ran for president last year before dropping his bid and endorsing Trump, vowed in one post on social media platform X to 'rein in lobbyists and slam shut the revolving door,' if elected president. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but then ran as an independent before striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. Now, after two days of hearings, his shot at that job is on the line with concerns about his anti-vaccine advocacy prompting nearly all Democrats to reject his nomination and a handful of Republicans who are at least considering doing the same. If Democrats unanimously oppose Kennedy, he'll need support from all but three Republicans. The Senate finance committee is expected to decide if he makes it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. Kennedy's response to the Senate committee was first reported by The New York Times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfk-jr-vows-to-stop-collecting-from-vaccine-lawsuit-if-confirmed-to-cabinet/7958807.html	2025-01-31T13:24:43-08:00	
Uganda health officials warn of Ebola outbreak	KAMPALA, UGANDA — A day after Uganda's Ministry of Health announced a new Ebola outbreak in the capital, Kampala, most Ugandans appeared unaware or unconcerned about the outbreak and went about their business normally. But health authorities are warning Ugandans not to take Ebola lightly. For weeks, Uganda has battled an outbreak of mpox, also known as monkeypox, that has affected more than 2,000 people and caused 13 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. But Dr. Julius Lutwama, deputy director of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, said Ugandans need to worry more about Ebola than mpox. 'Ebola is more highly infectious even than monkeypox,' Lutwama said. 'And it is even a more severe infection than monkeypox. The percentage of people that end up dead from Ebola is up to 80% while for monkeypox it is below 5%.' Ebola killed more than 50 people in Uganda during the 2022 outbreak. Nurse dies of Ebola On Thursday, Dr. Diana Atwine, Uganda's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health, announced the new outbreak after a 32-year-old nurse died from the disease. Atwine said the nurse sought treatment at multiple health facilities including Mulago National Referral Hospital and from a traditional healer. The patient suffered with high fever, chest pain and difficulty breathing since Jan. 20, then unexplained bleeding and multiple organ failure before dying Wednesday. Atwine said the nurse died from the Sudan strain of Ebola. 'We will leave it to God' While the Ministry of Health is cautioning the public with reminders of the symptoms of Ebola, several Kampala residents who spoke to VOA said they had not heard about or were not worried about the outbreak. Kampala resident Ntale Steven said he is not going to shut down his business. 'We will leave it to God, so the disease doesn't spread,' he said. 'And if there's an outbreak, we should get treatment and be helped. Health workers should also care for whoever gets infected. Because we have nothing to do, we must move.' Health authorities have moved to quarantine those who had contact with the deceased Ebola victim. Out of the 44 people in isolation, 30 are health workers from the National Referral Hospital. The rest are family members and health workers from other private facilities. Lutwama said because it takes days before symptoms start to show, this is when most infected persons transmit the disease to others, placing health workers at a higher risk. 'Many people then can transmit it during that period, before they come to that stage of bleeding,' said Lutwama. 'But still the health workers are supposed to be on the lookout. And they are also supposed to be protected, but as you know, sometimes our hospitals are missing a few things like gloves, they don't have hypochlorite like Jik [bleach] to be able to wash their hands thoroughly and things like that.' Even with warnings from Lutwama and the Ministry of Health, Ogwang John, a security guard, said he will take precautions only if he gets an order from his boss. 'Me, I'm not worried,' he said. 'I always go with the decision of my boss. When he says that we do this, the disease is there, yes, we can take. But if he has not talked with me, I'm also a carefree man.'

Lake Chad governors pledge stronger security, economic cooperation	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Leaders in Africa’s conflict-hit Lake Chad region have promised to fight illegal gun and drug trafficking, which were part of the discussions during their three-day gathering focused on stabilization, sustainability and development. The governors of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad have concluded an annual Lake Chad Basin Governors' Forum summit in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno State with local officials, traditional leaders, civil society groups and humanitarian partners also in attendance. This year's summit, the fifth since its inception in 2018, was hosted by Nigeria’s Yobe State. During the meeting, authorities praised ongoing joint efforts against terror groups, including Boko Haram and its offshoot ISWAP, in the region and pledged to intensify efforts to eliminate the remnants. ISWAP stands for the Islamic State in West Africa Province. The governors also resolved to combat illicit arms trade and drug trafficking while enhancing resilience initiatives to mitigate climate change and rehabilitate displaced populations. Ambassador Mamman Nuhu, executive secretary of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), said discussions over the three days were 'fruitful and robust.' 'This gathering has reaffirmed our shared commitment to sustainable peace, regional stability and the prosperity of the community we serve,' Nuhu said. The Lake Chad governors also pledged to establish free-trade zones to foster economic recovery and integrate more women and youth into stabilization and resilience programs. But officials raised concerns over the suspension of support for Niger’s National Window of the Regional Stabilization Facility (RSF), warning it could hinder regional progress. Lake Chad, a vast but shallow body of water surrounded by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, provides livelihoods for millions through agriculture. However, decades of climate change and poor water management have caused the lake’s surface area to shrink by an alarming 90%, increasing competition for scarce resources. In recent years, Islamist militant groups have exploited the instability, using the region as a recruitment ground. Matthias Naab, director of the Regional Service Center for Africa at the United Nations Development Program, said participants at the community level added a great deal to the forum. 'The richness of the engagements in the pre-forums with civil society organizations and traditional leaders has been a highlight of this forum,' Naab said. 'Their perspectives grounded in community realities and have strengthened our dialogue and reinforced the principle that stabilize, resilience and recovery must be shaped by the voices of those most affected.' The governors' forum also emphasized the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former fighters and called for member state support and collaboration with traditional leaders. The forum elected Nigeria’s Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, as its new chair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lake-chad-governors-pledge-stronger-security-economic-cooperation/7958773.html	2025-01-31T12:24:57-08:00	
War in Ukraine through the eyes of an artist	After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, artist and illustrator George Butler traveled to the war-torn country to paint scenes of modern wartime life.

Tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, China start Saturday	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump will put in place 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China effective on Saturday, the White House said on Friday, but it provided no word on whether there would be any exemptions to the measures that could result in swift price increases to U.S. consumers. Trump, a Republican, had been threatening the tariffs to ensure greater cooperation from the countries on stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl, but he also has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. 'Starting tomorrow, those tariffs will be in place,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. 'These are promises made and promises kept by the president.' Trump had said he was weighing issuing an exemption for Canadian and Mexican oil imports, but Leavitt said she had no information to share on the president's decision on any potential carveouts. The United States imported almost 4.6 million barrels of oil daily from Canada in October and 563,000 barrels from Mexico, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. daily production during that month averaged nearly 13.5 million barrels a day. He has previously stated that a 10% tariff on Chinese imports would be on top of other import taxes charged on products from the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tariffs-on-goods-from-canada-mexico-china-start-saturday-/7958695.html	2025-01-31T11:39:00-08:00	
More than 40 bodies recovered from Washington midair collision	Fire and emergency service officials in Washington said Friday that more than 40 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of a commercial passenger jet and military helicopter that collided and crashed into the Potomac River late Wednesday. Operations to recover the bodies of 67 people killed in the collision resumed at dawn Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board — or NTSB, the federal agency leading the investigation into the accident — reportedly is at the scene along with local and regional EMS crews. The commercial jet, a Bombardier CRJ700 regional craft operated by American Airlines subsidiary PSA Airlines, carried 64 passengers and crew, while the U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carried a crew of three. Officials said there were no survivors. The NTSB reported late Thursday the cockpit voice recorder and flight-data recorder from the airliner, devices often referred to as black boxes, have been recovered and are at the agency’s labs for evaluation. In an interview Friday with U.S.-based Fox News network, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the 'black box' for the helicopter had not yet been recovered, but that its data will likely determine who was piloting the helicopter at the time of the crash. Hegseth on Thursday said the crew, which was conducting a night-flight training evaluation, included a staff sergeant, a captain-in-training and a chief warrant officer, who was an instructor. The crew had been issued night vision goggles for the flight, but Hegseth said it was unclear if they were using them. The defense secretary also said Thursday that the helicopter’s altitude at the time of the accident was under investigation. The two aircraft collided as the passenger jet was attempting to land at Reagan National Airport. Hegseth said the flight voice and flight data recorders also could determine who was in communication with the airport’s air traffic control tower and if there was any confusion regarding the instructions they received. Citing a government report, The Washington Post said Thursday that the control tower was understaffed Wednesday night. The report said two people were handling the jobs of four inside the tower at the time of the collision. A similar report from U.S. broadcaster NBC News, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said a supervisor in the tower let an air traffic controller leave their shift early before the collision. That decision, the report said, left one controller to handle airplane traffic and helicopter traffic in the area, whereas typically there is one controller looking at each type of aircraft. The NBC report said it is allowable under Federal Aviation Administration standards for one person to do both jobs, although it is not considered optimal. The agency on Friday significantly restricted helicopter traffic in the immediate vicinity of Washington Reagan National Airport until further notice. At a news conference Thursday, both U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner from Virginian said they had expressed concerns over the years regarding the high volume of air traffic in the Washington area, but they would await results from the accident probe before revisiting that specific concern. During a White House news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump suggested previous presidential administrations, led by Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, lowered standards for the hiring of air traffic controllers and blamed diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives in the federal government for that. He said he reversed those initiatives with executive orders last week. The U.S. Figure Skating organization said several members of its community, including athletes, coaches and family members, were among the passengers on the plane. 'We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts,' the organization said. The Kremlin and Russian media said Russian figure skaters, including world champion couple Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, also were on the plane. Trump said his administration would facilitate the return of their remains to Russia. Wednesday’s crash was the deadliest aviation incident on U.S. soil since 2001, when an American Airlines flight crashed in Belle Harbor, New York, killing 260 people. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-40-bodies-recovered-from-washington-mid-air-collision/7958629.html	2025-01-31T11:03:21-08:00	
Anger in Greece over rail disaster prompts opposition plan to challenge government	ATHENS — Three Greek opposition parties vowed Friday to challenge the country’s center-right government with a censure motion over its handling of a deadly rail disaster nearly two years ago. The pledge was prompted by mounting public anger over delays in the inquiry and allegations of a cover-up that the government strongly denies. Fifty-seven people were killed — including college students returning from a holiday — when a passenger train collided head-on with a freight train on Feb. 28, 2023, near Tempe in northern Greece. On Sunday, relatives of those killed led protests in dozens of cities, directed at the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Apart from rallies held in Athens, Thessaloniki and other Greek cities, protests were also organized by Greek communities in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels and other European cities. Sokratis Famellos, leader of the left-wing Syriza party, said outside parliament that he sided with two other opposition parties, Pasok and the New Left, to seek a no-confidence vote. 'A joint initiative by progressive parties for a censure motion is necessary today. The evidence is there, and society demands accountability,' Famellos said Friday. Although a censure motion is unlikely to pose a direct threat to the government, it could help forge bonds in Greece’s fractured opposition. Lawmakers from the three parties confirmed they were involved in discussions to agree on the timing of the motion. Investigations have faced delays, with critics accusing authorities of obstructing justice. While some railway officials have been charged, no senior political figures have been held accountable, further intensifying public scrutiny. Speaking to ministers at a Cabinet meeting, Mitsotakis vowed to overcome the 'turbulence' facing the government. 'This difficult week comes to a close under the shadow of the Tempe tragedy,' he said in a televised address. 'We are now entering the final stage of investigations into this deeply painful national trauma.' The controversy overshadowed an ongoing parliamentary process to elect a new president. A government-backed candidate, Constantine Tassoulas, failed to win the cross-party support needed to secure the presidency in a second round of voting in parliament Friday. The 65-year-old former speaker of the assembly is expected to win in later rounds scheduled next month when the threshold is lowered.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-in-greece-over-rail-disaster-prompts-opposition-plan-to-challenge-government-/7958537.html	2025-01-31T09:53:21-08:00	
US aid freeze spells uncertain future for international media	WASHINGTON — On the front lines of the war in Ukraine, local newspapers are vital lifelines in areas where Russia has destroyed cell towers and internet infrastructure. Journalists provide information about evacuation routes, document alleged Russian war crimes and troop movements, and counter Moscow’s propaganda. Even a temporary freeze of U.S. foreign aid can mean financial difficulties for small media organizations that rely on outside donors to keep working. 'Many Ukrainian media may now face the threat of closure or significant reduction in operations in the coming weeks,' Sergiy Tomilenko, president of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, told VOA. Ukraine is not alone. News outlets on the front lines of war and authoritarianism from Ukraine and Belarus to Myanmar are among the organizations affected by a freeze on U.S. foreign aid. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 mandating all federal government agencies pause all foreign development assistance for 90 days. The directive took effect on Jan. 24 and includes foreign funding from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a White House directive that ordered a freeze on federal aid programs, but that does not apply to the foreign aid pause. 'Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a Jan. 26 statement. 'Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' Worldwide impact Many independent news outlets around the world rely on State Department and USAID funding because they report in repressive environments, according to the JX Fund, a Berlin-based group that supports exiled media. With the current freeze, news outlets around the world are scrambling to find alternative sources of funding in an attempt to continue delivering the news to their audiences and avoid shutting down, multiple analysts told VOA. 'The general feeling is panic. Panic is the only way to describe the situation,' Karol Luczka, who works in Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna, told VOA. JX Fund managing director Penelope Winterhager agreed. These outlets 'are thrown back to emergency mode,' she said. The measure is estimated to be affecting dozens of independent news outlets in more than 30 countries, according to the Brussels-based European Federation of Journalists, or EFJ. Maja Sever, EFJ president, called on potential donors to fill the gap. 'The European Union and other donors cannot abandon to their fate journalists who are the best bulwark for defending the rule of law and democracy in countries where they are under threat,' Sever said in a statement Tuesday. During the 90-day pause, relevant U.S. departments and agencies are required to review their foreign funding and determine whether the aid will continue, be modified or cease altogether, according to the executive order. Neither the State Department nor USAID replied to VOA’s requests for comment. In Ukraine Tomilenko said the aid freeze is creating a dire situation for Ukrainian news outlets on the front line of the war. 'In many areas close to the battle lines, local newspapers are often the only reliable source of information,' said Tomilenko, who is based in Kyiv. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has ramped up global propaganda efforts while further restricting independent media inside Russia. The war has also limited the advertising market in Ukraine, which would ideally be a primary source of financial independence for Ukrainian news outlets, said Tomilenko. The USAID website says it supports programs that 'promote free and independent media' in more than 30 countries. VOA could not determine how much U.S. aid goes to support media outlets in these countries. In the case of Ukraine, Luczka said, 'The previous administration in the U.S. saw the importance of supporting civil society in Ukraine in order to make sure that this country keeps standing.' The United States has been the strongest player when it came to supporting independent media outlets, according to the JX Fund’s Winterhager. But even though these outlets receive foreign funding, Winterhager emphasized that 'their reporting is independent.' In Myanmar Several Myanmar news outlets that rely on financial support from USAID and Internews also find themselves in a precarious situation. Internews is a USAID-affiliated nonprofit that supports independent media. After launching a coup in 2021, Myanmar’s military arrested journalists and banned news outlets. The crackdown forced entire outlets to flee into exile. Some outlets now report from the Thai-Myanmar border, while others manage to operate from rebel-controlled regions of Myanmar. Funding has been among the biggest problems for Myanmar media since the coup. 'It is difficult — or even impossible — for many of them to make commercial revenue in this environment,' Ben Dunant, editor-in-chief of the magazine Frontier Myanmar, told VOA last year. 'This underlines the vulnerability of these media organizations whose operations are dependent on the whims of donors in faraway countries.' Mizzima, one of the most prominent of the country’s news outlets and an affiliate of VOA, is among those affected by the aid freeze, according to local media reports. Founded in exile in 1998, the media outlet covers news on the resistance against the junta and China’s growing influence in the region. Another outlet, Western News, has already cut staff, according to its chief editor, Wunna Khwar Nyo. 'We are struggling to survive,' Wunna Khwar Nyo told VOA. 'Ultimately, this will also hurt the Burmese people.' If the funding freeze forces news outlets to shutter, the IPI’s Luczka warned that state-backed propaganda from countries such as Russia could fill the gap. 'When media outlets disappear, they create a void,' Luczka said. 'And that void needs to be filled by something.' VOA’s Burmese Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aid-freeze-spells-uncertain-future-for-international-media/7958494.html	2025-01-31T09:51:07-08:00	
Trump envoy Grenell expected to meet Venezuela's Maduro	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Richard Grenell is expected to meet with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday in Venezuela, according to U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone. Trump said last week his administration likely would stop buying oil from Venezuela and was looking 'very strongly' at the South American country. Grenell, Trump's envoy for special missions, had earlier said he spoke with multiple officials in Venezuela and would begin meetings, days after the outgoing Biden administration imposed new sanctions on the government of Maduro. 'Diplomacy is back,' Grenell said in a post on social media platform X disclosing his initial calls. 'Talking is a tactic.' During his campaign, Trump called Maduro a dictator after he pursued a 'maximum pressure' campaign against him during his first term, from 2017 to 2021, including imposing harsh sanctions on the South American country and its oil industry. Former President Joe Biden briefly rolled back some of the Trump-era restrictions following electoral promises from Maduro but then reinstated them, saying the Venezuelan leader had reneged on pledges for a fair democratic vote. The Financial Times reported Friday that Chevron is trying to protect the special U.S. license allowing it to operate in Venezuela. The oil giant's chief executive, Mike Wirth, told the newspaper the company would engage with the White House after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the license should be reconsidered. If Chevron is forced out, China and Russia will gain influence in the OPEC nation, Wirth said. Venezuela's oil exports to the U.S. soared 64% to some 222,000 barrels per day last year, making the United States its second-largest export market behind China, which took 351,000 bpd, down 18% compared with the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-envoy-grenell-expected-to-meet-venezuela-s-maduro/7958410.html	2025-01-31T08:38:16-08:00	
EU: Human rights progress needed to preserve Pakistan's trade privileges	ISLAMABAD — The European Union is linking Pakistan’s access to European trading markets as a duty-free exporter to progress on the country’s 'most pressing' human rights issues. Olof Skoog, the EU’s special human rights envoy, issued a warning Friday following a weeklong visit to the South Asian nation, where authorities have faced increasing accusations of suppressing civil liberties, political dissent, and free speech. 'The trade benefits under [the human rights development plan known as] GSP+ depend on the progress made on addressing a list of issues, including on human rights, and tangible reforms remain essential,' a post-visit EU statement quoted Skoog as saying. He referred to the Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, commonly known as GSP+, which grants developing countries, including Pakistan, tariff-free access to the EU market in exchange for its adherence to specific human and labor rights obligations. The EU statement noted that its envoy highlighted areas of concern during meetings with Pakistani leaders, including blasphemy laws, enforced disappearances, freedom of expression, media independence, impunity for rights violations, due process, fair trials, civic space, and the death penalty. 'As we approach the midterm of the current monitoring cycle, we encourage Pakistan to continue on its reform path as it prepares for reapplication under the upcoming new GSP+ regulation,' Skoog stated. The declaration noted that 'Pakistan has become the largest beneficiary of GSP+' since the implementation of the trading plan in 2014, with Pakistani businesses increasing their exports to the EU market by 108%. The EU envoy’s visit coincided with the swift passage of controversial amendments by Pakistan's parliament this week to cybercrime laws that critics warned would curtail freedom of speech, not only for the conventional media but also for social media users. The legislation criminalizes the 'intentional' spread of 'false news' with prison terms of up to three years, a fine of up to $7,100, or both. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, accused of growing censorship, has defended the law, saying it is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation. Pakistani and international free media advocacy groups, along with human rights activists, have condemned the amended law and are calling for its immediate repeal. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement that the law 'threatens the fundamental rights of Pakistani citizens and journalists while granting the government and security agencies sweeping powers to impose complete control over internet freedom in the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-human-rights-progress-needed-to-preserve-pakistan-s-trade-privileges/7958399.html	2025-01-31T08:08:50-08:00	
Many across Africa shocked by 90-day freeze on US aid	NAIROBI, KENYA — Many people across Africa are shocked and worried about the 90-day pause on U.S.-funded foreign aid and a stop-work order on existing grants and contracts worldwide. While the orders have been modified to allow waivers for 'life-saving humanitarian assistance,' many are struggling to assess the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision. The Trump administration says that the United States spends about $40 billion every year in aid, and that it’s time to review and prioritize America’s core national interest one dollar at a time. Most development and humanitarian assistance is channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development through various programs, working with individuals, communities, organizations and countries across the globe. In Kenya, while many organizations directly affected are keeping quiet, one employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he’s grateful for what American aid has accomplished over the years. 'We've been having success stories,' he said. The employee is among the hundreds who received a stop-work order. He said he is most concerned for the beneficiaries of programs he’s been associated with over the years. 'These are families who were anticipating they could get support. … This will stop. … There are children who are HIV-positive, and we always collaborate with their facilities to ensure that they are viral-suppressed. Now they’ll be of high viral load,' the man said. On Tuesday, the administration issued waivers on 'existing life-saving humanitarian' assistance programs, including 'core life-saving medicine,' which may apply to health programs such as PEPFAR, the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which works with partners in 55 countries worldwide. One of them is South Africa, where 7.8 million people have HIV/AIDS. Asanda Ngoasheng, an independent political analyst from South Africa, said the nation 'is the biggest beneficiary of the PEPFAR program, and has been for many years. … It will have dire consequences for people in the region because there are some people who come to South Africa to receive some medication. … So, it’s a medical disaster in waiting, effectively, and a humanitarian disaster in waiting.' Addressing a press conference broadcast live on SABC on Wednesday, South African Health Minister Dr. Pakishe Motsoaledi said he hopes withdrawn aid will not affect antiretroviral treatments. 'One thing we want to ascertain is that nobody must stop taking ARVs,' Motsoaledi said. 'That will be devastating. ... When you are on ARVs and you stop, there will be serious trouble.' Through PEPFAR, the U.S. has invested over $110 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving over 25 million lives and preventing millions of HIV infections since it was established more than two decades ago by President George W. Bush, according to U.S. State Department data. There are other programs that can’t afford a funding break, said Dr. Akila Udoji, manager of Karu Primary Healthcare Center, a Nigerian facility sponsored by USAID. 'Tuberculosis diagnosis treatment, if that funding is cut off, it will greatly affect the program because there won’t be any diagnosis of such cases and then the medicines, people can’t afford them,' Udoji said. 'And if they can’t afford it, it will lead to serious outbreaks of these diseases.' The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, an advocacy group, welcomed the administration’s review of foreign assistance programs in a statement but expressed some concerns. Former commander of U.S. Central Command Anthony Zinni, who is co-chair of the council of nearly 270 retired admirals and generals, warned that the freeze 'takes the U.S. off the playing field' and could directly affect U.S. military operations overseas. VOA requested interviews with the USAID offices in Kenya, Nigeria and the U.S. but did not receive replies. Meanwhile, the 90-day freeze is already paying dividends, a statement released by the U.S. State Department said this week. It said the review has already prevented over $1 billion in spending not aligned with the administration’s 'America First' agenda, including programs providing certain contraceptive, climate justice, clean energy and abortion programs and services. VOA’s Kate Bartlett in South Africa and Timothy Obiezu in Nigeria contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/many-across-africa-shocked-by-90-day-freeze-on-us-aid/7958378.html	2025-01-31T08:07:46-08:00

Hamas announces names of hostages to be released Saturday	The militant group Hamas has announced — and Israel has confirmed — the identity of the next three hostages to be released Saturday in the fourth such exchange between the sides under a ceasefire agreement to halt more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza. The hostages include Yarden Bibas, 35, who was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel along with his wife, Shiri, and two young boys, Ariel and Kfir. The fate of his family is uncertain. Also to be released is U.S.-Israeli citizen Keith Siegel, 65, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who was taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza along with his wife, Aviva Siegel. Aviva Siegel was released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. The third hostage was identified as Ofer Kalderon, 54, a French-Israeli hostage, who was captured by the militants from Kibbutz Nir Oz along with his two children. His ex-wife, Hadas, also was taken captive. The two children and Hadas Kalderon were released during the 2023 hostage exchange. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the U.S., Britain and other Western nations. Hamas released eight hostages, including three Israelis and five Thai nationals, on Thursday. Later in the day, Israel released 110 Palestinian prisoners, including 32 serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis. Under the ceasefire deal, more than 423,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza. The Israeli military ordered them out of the territory in the earliest stages of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. At a news conference Friday in Geneva, the U.N.’s World Food Program, WFP, provided an update on efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. Country Director Antoine Renard told reporters the agency has delivered more than 32,000 metric tons of food into Gaza since the ceasefire agreement began on Jan. 19. He said that amount was more than twice what was delivered in December and three times what was delivered in October. Renard said the WFP has already reached 300,000 people. Meanwhile, during a visit to Lebanon Friday, Egypt’s foreign affairs minister, Badr Abdelatty, called for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. Following talks with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Abdelatty told reporters, 'Egypt is very keen on confirming the need for a full and complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, without taking away a single inch of Lebanese sovereignty and territory.' Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal announced Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and the militant group Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26. Israeli forces have remained in more than a dozen villages past the deadline. The United States and Lebanon announced Sunday the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18. Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations in southern Lebanon, including airstrikes and shelling. They accuse Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. In statements posted to its social media accounts, the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported overnight Thursday its fighter jets launched several attacks against what it said were Hezbollah terrorist organization targets in Lebanon’s Bekaa region, which it said 'posed a threat to the Israeli home front and IDF forces.' The IDF statement said the targets included a military site 'with underground infrastructure for the development and production of weapons and transit infrastructure on the Syrian-Lebanon border' through which, the IDF said, Hezbollah was trying to transfer weapons. The IDF also reported the Israeli air force intercepted a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone over Israeli territory Thursday, which it said violates the ceasefire agreement. 'The IDF continues to be committed to the understandings reached regarding the ceasefire in Lebanon,' its statement said, 'and will not allow the execution of terrorist plots of this type.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-announces-names-of-hostages-to-be-released-saturday-/7958346.html	2025-01-31T07:32:20-08:00	
Rubio warns of China’s potential to block Panama Canal in conflict	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first official trip as the nation’s top diplomat on Saturday, with planned visits to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic from Saturday to Thursday. Officials and experts say the visit is partly aimed at countering China’s growing influence in the region. The trip comes as President Donald Trump pushes to regain control of the Panama Canal, and as Washington intensifies efforts to curb illegal migration. 'Secretary Rubio’s engagements with senior officials and business leaders will promote regional cooperation on our core, shared interests: Stopping illegal and large-scale migration, fighting the scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers, countering China, and deepening economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Friday. Trump has asserted that China controls the Panama Canal, a crucial trade route linking the Atlantic and Pacific. But Panama has denied the claim, insisting that it manages the canal impartially for all maritime traffic. On Thursday, Rubio warned that China could potentially block access to the canal in the event of a conflict. 'If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat,' Rubio said during an interview with SiriusXM Radio. In Panama City, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino ruled out any discussion of control over the canal with Rubio. 'I cannot negotiate and much less open a process of negotiation on the canal,' he told reporters on Thursday. 'That is sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.' Some analysts caution that China has been employing economic and noneconomic tactics across the Western Hemisphere to expand its influence, prompting national security concerns. 'You might think that you are just getting more Chinese investment in your country, but pretty soon you are kind of being coerced or coaxed into signing at the Belt and Road Initiative, or you're being coaxed into signing another deal that gives elements of your telecoms,' said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during an online discussion Thursday. The Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, is a massive infrastructure project launched by China in 2013 under President Xi Jinping, aiming to connect multiple continents through land and maritime routes. The United States has cautioned that the BRI 'is fueled by China's mission to manipulate and undermine the global rules-based trading system for its own benefit.' China’s foreign direct investment, or FDI, in Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly, Berg said, citing approximately $160 billion in Chinese FDI over the past 15 years. 'From the lens of national security, a lot of China's commercial endeavors are fundamentally military ambitions that they're prepositioning into Latin America,' said Joseph Humire, executive director of the Center for a Secure Free Society, or SFS, a national security think tank. 'China's been in Panama for more than 20 years, but China really got politically active in Panama after 2017,' when Panama signed the BRI and shifted its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People’s Republic of China, said Humire on Thursday. He said that Panama's economy has declined in recent years. All the nations on Rubio’s itinerary maintain diplomatic ties with Cuba and Venezuela. Given the strained U.S. relations with these countries and their restrictions on accepting deportees, Rubio may use his trip to advocate for 'third-country' agreements, allowing other nations to receive people deported by the U.S. Additionally, he could work on facilitating increased repatriation flights for migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-warns-of-china-s-potential-to-block-panama-canal-in-conflict/7958272.html	2025-01-31T06:46:15-08:00	
Serbian student protesters march ahead of bridge blockade as driver rams Belgrade demonstration	INDJIJA, Serbia — Hundreds of striking students marched through the Serbian countryside Friday as they took their anti-graft protest toward the northern city of Novi Sad, where they plan to blockade three bridges over the River Danube this weekend. The bridge blockade planned for Saturday will mark three months since a huge concrete construction at the railway station collapsed in Novi said on Nov. 1, leaving 15 people dead. What started two months ago as a protest against suspected corruption in construction contracts has developed into the most serious challenge in years to the country’s powerful populist leader, President Aleksandar Vucic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, a driver rammed a car into a silent protest Friday, injuring two women who work as doctors at a nearby psychiatric institution. Media reports say both hit the pavement with their heads and are being examined. The incident, the third of its kind in weeks, happened in downtown Belgrade during 15 minutes of silence observed daily throughout Serbia at around noon when the canopy collapsed at the railway station in Novi Sad. Pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked the protesters, many of them students, twice ramming cars into demonstrations. Two people were seriously injured in the previous attacks. Along the way to Novi Sad on Friday, the students were greeted by cheering citizens who honked their car horns or came out of their homes to offer food and drinks. When they reached the town of Indjija on Thursday, roughly halfway along their 80-kilometer route, the students were welcomed with fireworks and cheers from residents. Although most of them spent the night out in the open in a soccer field, the freezing temperatures did not dampen their desire for major changes in the corruption-ridden Balkan state. Nevena Vecerinac, a student, said she hoped the protesters' demands that include the punishment of all those responsible for the rail station tragedy will be fulfilled. 'We will make it to Novi Sad,' she said. 'Yesterday’s walk was easy. It’s cold now, but we can make it. We all have the same goal.' 'We need support from all people. With this energy and mood, I hope we can do it, otherwise there will be no brighter future,' said Luka Arsenovic, another student marcher. Many in Serbia believe that the collapse of the overhang at the train station was essentially caused by government corruption in a large infrastructure project with Chinese state companies. Critics believe graft led to a sloppy job during the reconstruction of the Novi Sad train station, poor oversight and disrespect of existing safety regulations. Monthslong demonstrations have already forced the resignation of Serbia’s prime minister Milos Vucevic this week, along with various concessions from authorities which were ignored by the protesters who say that is not enough. Vucic and other officials have shifted from accusing the students of working with foreign powers to oust him, to offering concessions or issuing veiled threats. The strength and determination of the protesters have caught many by surprise in a country where hundreds of thousands of young people have emigrated, looking for opportunities elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-student-protesters-march-ahead-of-bridge-blockade-as-driver-rams-belgrade-demonstration-/7958279.html	2025-01-31T06:36:55-08:00	
Chad officials say French troops have finally left after 70 years’ presence	YAOUNDE — Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Chad's military is ready to protect the country from any destabilization attempt as a January 31 deadline loomed for France to withdraw its troops. The last French troops left the N'djamena military base they occupied for about 70 years this week, continuing France’s reduced military presence in West Africa. Chad's President Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby says this week’s departure of the last French troops from the central African state signals a new dawn for Chad. Deby spoke at the Sergeant Adji Kossei Military Base in Chad's capital, N'djamena, Friday, during a ceremony to mark the complete withdrawal of French troops before the January 31 deadline he gave Paris to pull out its troops. The event, broadcast on state radio and TV, was attended by top military officials, government ministers, traditional rulers, diplomats and huge crowds of onlookers. Twenty-six-year-old teacher Balkange Jean spoke to VOA via a messaging app from N'djamena Friday. He said he was delighted to see French troops leaving. He said he does not understand why it took a long time for Chad’s government officials to order French troops out. He says French troops were only useful in Chad from June 1983 to December 1984, when France sent close to 4,000 troops to stop an invasion by Libyan military and Chad rebels. French troops officially arrived in N'djamena to train the country’s young military during independence in 1960. Deby said the forces remained, claiming France wanted to support Chad's air force against rebels. It stationed troops in N'djamena claiming it was helping Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger to fight militant groups and terrorists operating within Sahel states. State TV reports that the last French military planes and fighter aircraft left Chad Friday after handing over France's last military base in a military ceremony in N'Djamena Thursday. Chad announced an end to military cooperation with France November 28. On December 10, several hundred of the more than 1,000 French troops began leaving, but on December 31, Deby ordered the troops to leave his country by January 31. General Pascal Ianni, the commander of French forces in Africa, speaking on Chad state TV on Friday, said the withdrawal of French troops from several African countries, including Chad, enables France to adapt itself to a revolution that Africa and the world is facing. He said France has to reinvent its military ties in Africa, where dynamic and younger leaders are affecting several changes and bringing hope to their citizens. French troops were also ordered out of the West African nations of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali following coups in the countries. Last year, Senegal said it was negotiating the withdrawal of French forces before December of this year. Djelassem Maïbé Adolphe is a former member of Chad’s Movement for Peace, Reconstruction and Development, a former rebel group. He was granted amnesty and freed from prison by Deby in August. He said many leaders in French-speaking African states with young leaders tend to turn to Russia for military assistance because of growing anti-French sentiments. He said African countries should make sure they individually and collectively have strong militaries to protect their territories instead of thinking that they can always count on external support. Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have shifted toward Russia by signing military deals and inviting Russian troops to train Africa militaries. Chad says it is within its sovereign powers to negotiate military cooperation with any country of its choice, and that its troops are well trained to protect Chadians and their territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-officials-say-french-troops-have-finally-left-after-70-years-presence-/7958190.html	2025-01-31T06:02:52-08:00	
Myanmar’s rebels closing in around junta into fifth year of civil war	Bangkok — Myanmar’s rebel groups made historic gains last year, the fourth of a civil war set off by a military coup in February 2021, seizing wide swathes of the country’s west and northeast and overrunning two of the regime’s regional command bases for the first time. As the war enters its fifth bloody year Saturday, experts tell VOA the rebels are positioned to keep gaining ground in 2025, closing in on more cities and weapons factories vital to the military despite mounting efforts by China, which has billions of dollars invested in the country, to keep the junta afloat. 'The military has lost significant control, and in 2025, based on that trajectory over late 2023 and 2024 … it will still continue to lose control,' said Matthew Arnold, an independent analyst tracking the war. A BBC World Service study found the junta in full control of only 21% of Myanmar as of mid-November, a patchwork of rebel groups holding 42% and both sides contesting the rest. With the ground they gained over the past year, Arnold says the rebels have transformed the war by linking up what were mostly pockets of armed resistance into long stretches across the country which the military can no longer penetrate overland. 'The military does not face rebels in this valley or that valley, or this mountaintop or that mountaintop. They say these rebels can now attack us across hundreds and hundreds of miles of contiguous territory where they have absolutely full control,' he said. 'It just fundamentally shifted the nature of warfare in the country.' The rebels’ latest gains have not been even across the country. In northeast Myanmar’s Shan state, China pressured one of the largest rebel groups in the area, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), into a ceasefire with the military in mid-January after the group had made major advances. Experts tell VOA that China has also started leaning on Myanmar’s largest rebel group, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), to cut back on weapons sales to other groups. Both the MNDAA and UWSA keep close ties with Beijing, and while the latter are not fighting the Myanmar military themselves, they have been a major source of arms and ammunition for rebel groups that are. Without their help, other groups have been forced to scale back their push toward Myanmar’s second largest city, Mandalay, which remains in junta control, says Min Zaw Oo, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. He said the squeeze on munitions has even helped the junta reverse gains another group, the Karenni National Defense Force, had been making in Kayah state, just south of Shan. 'They had to stop the offensive and they had to abandon, and now they are losing ground. One of the key factors was they … acquired less ammunition and weapons from UWSA,' said Min Zaw Oo. Elsewhere, though, rebel groups have continued to press ahead, even defying Beijing’s interests. In Myanmar’s far north, the capture of rare earth mines that supply China by the Kachin Independence Army in November compelled China to resume some of the border trade it had cut off to try and slow down the KIA’s march south, said Min Zaw Oo. In the west, the Arakan Army (AA) has nearly completed its sweep across Rakhine state and surrounded an oil and gas terminal on the shores of the Bay of Bengal central to China’s energy projects in Myanmar. Arnold and Min Zaw Oo say the AA is now pushing farther east with other allied groups into Ayeyarwady, Bago and Magwe regions in Myanmar’s center. Magwe, they add, with its many factories churning out weapons for the military, would be an especially big prize for the rebels and a painful loss for the junta if it were to fall next. The military’s recent losses to the AA also highlight one of the military’s main problems, says Morgan Michaels of the U.K.’s International Institute for Strategic Studies — a lack of manpower. Under pressure by rebel groups on nearly all sides, he said, the military could muster few reinforcements late last year as the AA bore down on its regional command base for western Myanmar, which it took, dealing the junta another heavy blow. The junta began enforcing a dormant conscription law in April to bolster troop numbers being worn down by desertions, defections and battlefield losses, and toughened the rules earlier this month to try and cut down on draft dodgers. 'Basically, the military cannot respond to protect or … wage counter attacks at these very sensitive and important strategic areas because of the manpower issue,' said Michaels. 'Opposition forces have their own limitations,' he added. 'But if the military can’t respond, then it’s going to bit by bit lose these areas.' The rebels’ own problems, the experts say, include an ever-short supply of ammunition and limited strategic coordination between the groups — many fighting for territory for any one of the country’s myriad ethnic minorities — across the whole of the country. Even so, they say they still expect most of the rebel groups in the fight to keep advancing on the junta into the year ahead. Conflict data crunched by Michaels and his team at the International Institute for Strategic Studies show no letup in the overall level of violence. Estimates of civilians and soldiers killed in the fighting stretch into the tens of thousands. Over 3 million people have been displaced, and half the country now lives in poverty. Bolstered by a steady stream of weapons and diplomatic cover from China and Russia, the experts also say the junta remains resilient but add that the collapse of a military battle-hardened by decades of counterinsurgency and once seen as all but invincible now looks plausible. Much will depend on how much longer Beijing in particular believes the junta has a useful role to play in protecting China’s economic and strategic interests in the country, says Arnold. 'China’s very straightforward, they’re very logical in what they see,' he said. 'And at some point, if the military doesn’t really stabilize the situation, China will have to make hard decisions about how much is it willing to support a military that is still losing control. And I think that will be the question for 2025.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-rebels-closing-in-around-junta-into-fifth-year-of-civil-war-/7958145.html	2025-01-31T05:23:58-08:00	
DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT fuels debate over AI building blocks	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — When Chinese startup DeepSeek released its AI model this month, it was hailed as a breakthrough, a sign that China’s artificial intelligence companies could compete with their Silicon Valley counterparts using fewer resources. The narrative was clear: DeepSeek had done more with less, finding clever workarounds to U.S. chip restrictions. However, that storyline has begun to shift. OpenAI, the U.S.-based company behind ChatGPT, now claims DeepSeek may have improperly used its proprietary data to train its model, raising questions about whether DeepSeek’s success was truly an engineering marvel. In statements to several media outlets this week, OpenAI said it is reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have trained its AI by mimicking responses from OpenAI’s models. The process, known as distillation, is common among AI developers but is prohibited by OpenAI’s terms of service, which forbid using its model outputs to train competing systems. Some U.S. officials appear to support OpenAI’s concerns. At his confirmation hearing this week, Commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick accused DeepSeek of misusing U.S. technology to create a 'dirt cheap' AI model. 'They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,' Lutnick said of China. David Sacks, the White House czar for AI and cryptocurrency, was more measured, saying only that it is 'possible' that DeepSeek had stolen U.S. intellectual property. In an interview with the cable news network Fox News, Sacks added that there is 'substantial evidence' that DeepSeek 'distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,' adding that stronger efforts are needed to curb the rise of 'copycat' AI systems. At the center of the dispute is a key question about AI’s future: how much control should companies have over their own AI models, when those programs were themselves built using data taken from others? AI data fight The question is especially relevant for OpenAI, which faces its own legal challenges. The company has been sued by several media companies and authors who accuse it of illegally using copyrighted material to train its AI models. Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in intellectual property, AI, and data rights, said OpenAI’s accusations against DeepSeek are 'deeply ironic,' given the company’s own legal troubles. 'OpenAI has had no problem taking everyone else’s content and claiming it’s 'fair,'' Hughes told VOA in an email. 'If the reports are accurate that OpenAI violated other platforms’ terms of service to get the training data it has wanted, that would just add an extra layer of irony – dare we say hypocrisy – to OpenAI complaining about DeepSeek.' DeepSeek has not responded to OpenAI’s accusations. In a technical paper released with its new chatbot, DeepSeek acknowledged that some of its models were trained alongside other open-source models – such as Qwen, developed by China’s Alibaba, and Llama, released by Meta – according to Johnny Zou, a Hong Kong-based AI investment specialist. However, OpenAI appears to be alleging that DeepSeek improperly used its closed-source models – which cannot be freely accessed or used to train other AI systems. 'It’s quite a serious statement,' said Zou, who noted that OpenAI has not yet presented evidence of wrongdoing by DeepSeek. Proving improper distillation may be difficult without disclosing details on how its own models were trained, Zou added. Even if OpenAI presents concrete proof, its legal options may be limited. Although Zou noted that the company could pursue a case against DeepSeek for violating its terms of service, not all experts believe such a claim would hold up in court. 'Even assuming DeepSeek trained on OpenAI's data, I don't think OpenAI has much of a case,' said Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in intellectual property and technology. Even though AI models often have restrictive terms of service, 'no model creator has actually tried to enforce these terms with monetary penalties or injunctive relief,' Lemley wrote in a recent paper with co-author Peter Henderson. The paper argues that these restrictions may be unenforceable, since the materials they aim to protect are 'largely not copyrightable.' 'There are compelling reasons for many of these provisions to be unenforceable: they chill good faith research, constrain competition, and create quasi-copyright ownership where none should exist,' the paper noted. OpenAI’s main legal argument would likely be breach of contract, said Hughes. Even if that were the case, though, he added, 'good luck enforcing that against a Chinese company without meaningful assets in the United States.' Possible options The financial stakes are adding urgency to the debate. U.S. tech stocks dipped Monday after following news of DeepSeek’s advances, though they later regained some ground. Commerce nominee Lutnick suggested that further government action, including tariffs, could be used to deter China from copying advanced AI models. But speaking the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to take a different view, surprising some industry insiders with an optimistic take on DeepSeek’s breakthrough. The Chinese company’s low-cost model, Trump said, was 'very much a positive development' for AI, because 'instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with hopefully the same solution.' If DeepSeek has succeeded in building a relatively cheap and competitive AI model, that may be bad for those with investment – or stock options – in current generative AI companies, Hughes said. 'But it might be good for the rest of us,' he added, noting that until recently it appeared that only the existing tech giants 'had the resources to play in the generative AI sandbox.' 'If DeepSeek disproved that, we should hope that what can be done by a team of engineers in China can be done by a similarly resourced team of engineers in Detroit or Denver or Boston,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deepseek-vs-chatgpt-fuels-debate-over-ai-building-blocks/7958031.html	2025-01-31T02:52:21-08:00	
Russian drones injure 4 in Ukraine's south, Ukrainian officials say	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia launched a barrage of drones on Ukraine in an overnight attack on Friday, injuring four people and damaging a hospital and a grain warehouse in the southern Odesa region, officials said. Ukraine's air defenses shot down 59 of 102 Russian drones, the air force said. It said that 37 drones were 'lost,' referring to the use of electronic warfare to redirect them. Russian drones caused damage in the northeastern Sumy region, the Odesa region in the south and the central Cherkasy Region. Oleh Kiper, the Odesa regional governor, said that four civilians, including a doctor, were injured in drone attacks targeting the city of Chornomorsk. The strikes also partially disrupted electricity supplies in the city and damaged the city's hospital, an administrative building, a grain warehouse, a residential house, and several trucks, he said on the Telegram app. Regional officials in the central Cherkasy region said that drone debris damaged an apartment building in the region. Meanwhile, an oil refinery in Russia's southern Volgograd region caught fire after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack, but the blaze has now been put out, the regional governor said on Friday. Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defenses had repelled an attack on his region by eight drones. 'As a result of falling debris from one of the drones, a fire broke out on the territory of an oil refinery, which was promptly extinguished. One injured refinery worker was hospitalized,' he said. Andriy Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, said on Telegram that the Volgograd oil refinery, which he described as one of Russia's largest, had been struck. SHOT, a Russian news outlet with contacts in the security services, said four Ukrainian drones had been destroyed over a second refinery in Yaroslavl, northeast of Moscow. Ukraine has carried out frequent air attacks on Russian refineries, oil depots and industrial sites to cripple key infrastructure underpinning Russia's war effort. This week it claimed to have struck and set on fire a Lukoil refinery, Russia's fourth largest, in the Nizhny Novgorod region, east of Moscow. Sources at Lukoil denied that the NORSI refinery was hit, and said production was not affected. Petrochemical company Sibur said there had been a drone strike and fire at its nearby plant. Russia is currently feeding more crude oil through its refineries in the hope of boosting fuel exports after new U.S. sanctions on Russian tankers and traders made exports of unprocessed crude more difficult, sources told Reuters this week. A Ukrainian drone attack last week forced a refinery in Ryazan, southeast of Moscow, to suspend operations. Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that 49 Ukrainian drones had been downed over the country overnight, including 25 in the southern Rostov region and eight in the Volgograd region. Drones had also been detected and destroyed in the Kursk, Yaroslavl, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Krasnodar regions, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drones-injure-4-in-ukraine-s-south-ukrainian-officials-say/7958004.html	2025-01-31T01:16:21-08:00	
Israel targets Hezbollah sites in Lebanon, accuses group of ceasefire breach	DUBAI, UAE — The Israeli military said on Friday it struck several Hezbollah targets overnight in the Bekaa Valley and along the Syrian-Lebanese border. The army said the targets include a facility used for underground weapons development and another associated with the smuggling of arms into Lebanon. On Thursday, Israel said it intercepted a surveillance drone launched by Hezbollah calling it 'a breach of the ceasefire agreement' between Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel reached a ceasefire in late November, ending a deadly conflict that began with the Gaza war in 2023. The U.S. confirmed on Sunday that the agreement, which includes a 60-day period for Israeli troop withdrawal, will remain in effect until Feb. 18, extending the original Jan. 26 deadline. Israel has carried out multiple strikes on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire extension killing and injuring more than 100 people. The most recent attack is a drone strike that injured at least five people in southern Lebanese town of Majdal Selm.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-targets-hezbollah-sites-in-lebanon-accuses-group-of-ceasefire-breach/7957990.html	2025-01-31T00:34:59-08:00	
Trump support for denuclearization talks with Russia, China raises hopes	white house — Arms control advocates are hoping U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh words of support for denuclearization will lead to talks with Russia and China on arms reduction. U.S. negotiations with the Russians and Chinese on denuclearization and eventual agreements are 'very possible,' according to Trump, who addressed the World Economic Forum a week ago in Davos, Switzerland. 'Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear [weapons], and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about because you don’t want to hear,' he said. 'It’s too depressing.' Trump noted that in his first term, he discussed the topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'We were talking about denuclearization of our two countries, and China would have come along,' according to Trump. 'President Putin really liked the idea of cutting back on nuclear [armaments], and I think the rest of the world — we would have gotten them to follow.' Just months before leaving office, former U.S. President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in Peru where both agreed that decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons should remain under human control. That consensus was seen as a positive step after the Chinese, four months previously, suspended nuclear arms control talks with Washington to protest American arms sales to Taiwan. The horror of nuclear attacks first became evident to many in the world through magazines in the West, which printed photographs of the radiation-burned survivors of the U.S. atomic attack on two Japanese cities in 1945 to end World War II. In subsequent years during the Cold War, U.S. government films captured the destructive force of test detonations in the Nevada desert, eventually prompting public demonstrations to 'ban the bomb' and diplomacy to reduce or eliminate all nuclear weapons. A major breakthrough occurred in 1987 with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the United States and the Soviet Union. It entered into full force the following year. By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been dismantled. That was the first time the two nuclear superpowers achieved a reduction of such weapons rather than just limiting their growth. Over the years, the Americans and the Russians lost their monopoly on nuclear weapons. Nine countries presently have nuclear arsenals, although Israel has never acknowledged possession of such weaponry. The United States and Russia each have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads — 90% of the world’s total. The combined global force of all countries’ nuclear weapons could destroy the world many times over, according to arms control advocates. The current New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, set limits on the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems, while including on-site inspection and exchanges of data for verification. The treaty expires in early February 2026, which adds urgency to Trump’s call for talks with Russia and China, according to Xiaodon Liang, senior analyst for nuclear weapons policy and disarmament at the Arms Control Association. 'And because of that, this issue has to be at the top of the agenda, and having a signal that the president is concerned about this issue and thinking about it is very positive,' Liang told VOA. Since a formal, comprehensive agreement could take years to negotiate — possibly spanning beyond the four years of the second Trump presidency — Liang suggests the U.S. president consider an 'executive agreement' with Putin, an informal consensus or a series of unilateral steps to continue adhering to the numbers in New START for an indefinite period. 'That would be a stabilizing factor in this important bilateral relationship,' Liang added. There are analysts who advocate a more aggressive tactic. Trump should consider ordering a resumption of nuclear testing to demonstrate to America’s adversaries that the U.S. arsenal of weapons of mass destruction remains viable and as an act of resolve, writes Robert Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank seen as having a dominant influence on Trump administration policies. Peters also suggests that Trump might want to withdraw from the 1963 Test Ban Treaty made with Moscow and 'conduct an above-ground test either at the Nevada National Security Site or in the Pacific Ocean over open water, where nuclear fallout can be minimized' to stave escalatory moves by an adversary to the United States. The Heritage Foundation did not respond to multiple requests from VOA to interview Peters. Moscow is not known to have conducted any sort of test causing a nuclear chain reaction, known as criticality, since 1990. Two years later, the United States announced it would no longer test nuclear weapons, although subcritical simulations continue. The other nuclear nations have followed suit except North Korea, which last triggered a nuclear test explosion in 2017. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday moved up the hands of its 'Doomsday Clock' by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, meant to signify the peril from weapons of mass destruction and other existential threats. 'We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technology,' said Daniel Holz, a physics professor at the University of Chicago, just after the hands of this year’s clock were unveiled at the U.S. Institute of Peace. While the Doomsday Clock is merely symbolic, Liang at the Arms Control Association sees it as an annual important ritual highlighting the risks to Americans and everyone else posed by the world’s nuclear arsenals. 'It is a good tool for bringing this to more people’s attention, and you can’t blame Americans for having so many other issues on their plate. And having this [clock] as a reminder, I think, is an effective communications tool,' Liang said. At the Doomsday Clock ceremony, VOA asked former Colombian President and Nobel laureate Juan Manuel Santos what he viewed as the biggest hurdle to Trump, Putin and Xi making progress on denuclearization. 'The biggest challenge, in my view, is for them to understand that they should sit down and talk about how the three of them can take decisions to save their own countries and the whole world,' he said. Liang compared the situation to U.S. President John F. Kennedy's call to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which led Washington and Moscow to pull back from the brink of nuclear war. That resolution turned the hands of the Doomsday Clock the following year back to 12 minutes to midnight in recognition of the Americans, Soviets and British banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space and under water. It has been several years since the United States engaged in any denuclearization negotiations. Those working-level talks in 2019 in Sweden between the first Trump administration and North Korean officials did not yield any agreement, with Pyongyang’s chief negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, telling reporters that the Americans had raised expectations with promises of flexibility but would not 'give up their old viewpoint and attitude.' The State Department spokesperson at the time, Morgan Ortagus, said in a statement the two countries could not be expected to 'overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula in the course of a single Saturday,' but such weighty issues 'require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-support-for-denuclearization-talks-with-russia-china-raises-hopes-/7957584.html	2025-01-30T23:06:25-08:00

Spain well short of NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional spending	As U.S. President Donald Trump demands a large increase in defense spending by NATO allies, the spotlight has fallen on Spain, which spends the least on defense of all member states relative to the size of its economy. Spain is the eurozone’s fourth-biggest economy. The country spent an estimated $21.3 billion on defense last year, equating to 1.28% of its gross domestic product (GDP), putting it at the bottom of the league among the 32-nation Atlantic alliance. That’s despite a pledge made by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at least 2% of GDP on defense, according to the bloc. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte visited Madrid and Lisbon earlier this week and warned all members of the need to boost spending beyond existing targets. 'The goal of 2%, now set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the challenges of tomorrow. The threat from Russia may seem distant, but let me assure you, it is not,' Rutte said at a press conference in Lisbon on Jan. 27. 'NATO is strong today. To keep NATO strong we must, however, continue to adapt. And to guarantee our security in the future, we also need to ramp up our efforts now. It also means we need to spend more in our defense,' he said. Only 23 of the 32 NATO member states were expected to meet the 2% target by 2024, according to the alliance. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has rejected criticism that his government has been too slow to boost defense spending. In a statement, the prime minister’s office said Monday that Spain was a 'serious, responsible and committed ally of NATO,' noting that the government had increased defense spending by 70% in the last decade. 'Spain's commitment to reach 2% of defense spending by 2029 is firm,' the statement said. Spanish troops are also helping to train Ukrainian forces as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Trump criticism That’s unlikely to be enough to satisfy NATO’s biggest spender, the United States, which spent 3.38% of its GDP on defense in 2024. Earlier in January, Trump described Spain’s contribution to NATO as 'very low' and has demanded a much higher spending target from European allies. 'I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,' Trump told delegates by video link at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 23. Trump has long complained that European allies are taking advantage of the United States, insisting that they should share the burden of defense spending. However, the 5% target is unrealistic for Spain, according to analyst Pere Ortega of the Delas Center for Peace Studies in Madrid. 'Reaching 5% is impossible. That would mean that Spain would have to spend almost 65 billion euros [$67.7 billion]. That is impossible, because we do not have that economic capacity,' Ortega told VOA. 'No political program would ask for an increase in military spending to reach 3, 4 or 5% ... because that would be in some way making sacrifices in the social security sphere. And the Spanish population would penalize that with their vote at the polls,' Ortega added. Lithuania boost Trump does have some support in Europe. Lithuania plans to raise defense spending to 5% or 6% of GDP by 2026. Announcing the increase on January 17, Lithuanian Minister of Defense Dovile Sakaliene said the policy was a response to regional threats. 'We are fitting in with NATO defense plans, which are vital to our region,' he said. Poland and Estonia have also indicated their intention to boost defense spending toward Trump’s target of 5%. France has also urged allies to invest more, although Paris only met the 2% target itself in 2023. 'What will we do in Europe tomorrow if our American ally withdraws its warships from the Mediterranean? If they send their fighter jets from the Atlantic to the Pacific?' French President Emmanuel Macron said Jan. 20 in an address to members of the French military. 'These are scenarios that we need to prepare for. These are the scenarios that we are preparing for.' At his first NATO summit as U.S. president in 2017, Trump berated other members for failing to spend enough on defense. European allies, including Spain, are braced for further robust diplomacy ahead of the next summit, scheduled to be held in The Hague in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-well-short-of-nato-defense-target-as-trump-demands-huge-additional-spending-/7957334.html	2025-01-30T23:05:05-08:00	
Teen skaters, group of hunters and students among victims of air crash	WICHITA, KANSAS — The victims of a crash between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter included teen figure skaters returning from a national meet with their mothers and coaches, an Ohio college student coming from her grandfather's funeral, two Chinese nationals and a group of hunters headed back from a guided trip in Kansas. They were among 60 travelers and four crew members on board the commercial flight late Wednesday when it collided with the Black Hawk helicopter, which was carrying three soldiers. Officials say there were no survivors. As the search for remains continued Thursday, communities grieved. Faith leaders held a vigil Thursday in the city council chambers. 'The only way we will get through this is together,' said the Rev. Pamela Hughes Mason of Wichita's St. Paul AME Church. American Airlines set up a hotline as well as centers in Washington and Wichita for people searching for information about family members who may have been aboard the downed flight. Here's what we know about some of the people killed in Wednesday night's crash: From the Skating Club of Boston Skaters Jinna Han and Spencer Lane were among those killed, according to Doug Zeghibe, CEO of the Skating Club of Boston. Their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane, as well as their coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov also died. Han and Lane, who was about 16, were returning from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 'We watched Jinna just grow up here from just a tiny little tyke into this amazingly mature 13-year-old,' he said. 'A great performer, a great competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.' Spencer Lane, who was from Barrington, Rhode Island, took part in his first professional show in December with Elin Schran's company, Joy Skate Productions. 'He started to discover this connection with the audience and that joy that he was giving to other people through his gift,' Schran said. In a statement, the Lane family recalled Christine Lane for both her singular talents and her dedication to parenting. 'Christine exuded creativity throughout her life, using her formal graphic design training as a jumping-off point for seemingly endless creative pursuits across areas such as photography, quilting, knitting, and more. She brought even greater passion to her role as a mother to Spencer and his brother Milo,' the family said. Their coaches, Shishkova and Naumov, won the pairs title at the 1994 world championships in Chiba, Japan. The Russia-born pair also competed twice in the Olympics. More young athletes and coaches Skating organizations in Philadelphia and the Washington area also said some of their young athletes had been aboard the plane. Several athletes on the flight had attended a development camp held after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships ended Sunday in Wichita, Kansas. Wichita Skating Center manager Sean O'Reilly said the championships brought a 'groundswell of positivity,' drawing enthusiastic parents and young athletes from across the U.S. He was 'gutted' to learn some of those skaters had been killed. In Virginia's Loudoun County, a coach at a skating club was also identified as among the passengers, Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam confirmed. The club, Ashburn Ice House, said that its 'figure skating community has been directly affected,' but did not give further details. Students Students and parents at Cedarville University in Ohio said one of the passengers on the plane was Grace Maxwell, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. Maxwell's father, Dean Maxwell, said she was returning to campus from her home in Wichita, Kansas, after attending her grandfather's funeral, The Wichita Eagle reported. Grace Maxwell had been working on a project this semester to create a hand-stabilizing device to help a boy in the area feed himself instead of relying on others, the university said in a statement. 'Grace was a quiet person with a keen interest in helping others through engineering,' said Tim Norman, who served as her secondary adviser. Three other students from schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, and six parents from the district were also on board the plane, superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families. She did not identify them, but she said the students were from different schools and that two of the parents were current or former district staffers. Chinese citizens, Philippines police officer Chinese citizens and a cop from the Philippines Philippine Police Col. Pergentino Malabed Jr., who headed the supply management division of the national police, was among the dead. He had traveled to the U.S. to inspect equipment the Philippines was planning to purchase for its 232,000-member force, according to the Philippine police. 'His untimely passing is a profound loss to the Philippine National Police, where he served with honor, with integrity and dedication throughout his career,' Philippine police said in a statement. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said two Chinese nationals were also among the victims. It did not offer further details. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its condolences for the crash victims and requested the U.S. to 'promptly report any progress with the search and rescue and find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible.' Hunters headed home from a trip Seven people returning from a guided hunting trip in Kansas were killed, according to a Facebook post by Fowl Plains, the guide service. The Fowl Plains team said they had grown close to the hunters on board the flight over the years and considered them to be family members. The post doesn't identify the hunters by name, but it says they had spent the past week on a guided hunt, 'laughing, talking about our families and sharing memories.' 'Heartbroken is an understatement,' the company said. Members of a Maryland union Those killed also included four steamfitters, all members of a United Association union local in suburban Maryland, union leaders said in a social media post Thursday. 'Our focus now is on providing support and care to the families of our brothers as we continue to gather more information in the coming days,' said the post by UA General President Mark McManus and Chris Madello, the business manager of Local 602. From the military The victims also include three soldiers who were aboard the helicopter. Officials said their remains will be at Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. That office coordinates the dignified transfer of fallen service members. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet announced. No identities of the crew have been released. But the wife of one of the helicopter pilots said on Facebook that her husband, Andrew Eaves of Noxubee County, Mississippi, was killed. In a phone call, Carrie Eaves confirmed the post was hers. 'We ask that you pray for our family and friends and for all the other families that are suffering today. We ask for peace while we grieve,' her post read. The three soldiers were doing an annual night proficiency training flight, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding they were a 'fairly experienced crew.' Officials were notifying relatives, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-skaters-group-of-hunters-and-students-among-victims-of-air-crash/7957971.html	2025-01-30T22:47:18-08:00	
Senate confirms North Dakota's Burgum as Trump interior secretary	The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, as President Donald Trump's interior secretary. The vote was 79-18. Burgum, 68, will lead an agency that guides the use of 202 million hectares of federal and tribal land, a fifth of the nation's surface area. He is expected to pursue Trump's goal of maximizing energy and mineral production on public lands, likely by ratcheting up new leasing in oil-producing states like Wyoming and New Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has said is now officially called the Gulf of America. A wealthy former software executive, Burgum has portrayed himself as a traditional, business-minded conservative. During his nomination hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms that could speed development of energy projects like transmission lines and pipelines. His comments signaled a sharp turn in federal policy after former President Joe Biden's administration sought to limit oil and gas drilling on federal lands and promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar as part of its climate change agenda. Burgum ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination before quitting and becoming a Trump supporter. He is also being considered to head a new national council to coordinate policies to boost U.S. energy output.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-north-dakota-s-burgum-as-trump-interior-secretary/7957967.html	2025-01-30T22:19:20-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern Congo say they plan to take their fight to the capital	GOMA, CONGO — Rwanda-backed rebels who captured eastern Congo's largest city said Thursday they want to take their fight to the far-off capital, Kinshasa, while Congo’s president called for a massive military mobilization to resist the rebellion and his defense minister rejected calls for talks. In a video message, Congo's Defense Minister Guy Kabombo Muadiamvita said he has directed plans for any dialogue with the rebels to 'be completely burned immediately.' 'We will stay here in Congo and fight. If we do not stay alive here, let’s stay dead here,' said Muadiamvita, a close ally of Congo's president. At a briefing where they sought to assert their control over the eastern city of Goma and surrounding territory in the neighboring South Kivu province, the M23 rebels said they would be open to dialogue with the government, also proposed by the east African regional bloc of which Rwanda is a member. Their motive, however, is to gain political power, Corneille Nangaa, one of the political leaders of M23, said during the briefing. 'We want to go to Kinshasa, take power and lead the country,' Nangaa said. He did not indicate how the rebels planned to advance on the capital, more than 1,500 kilometers away. Rwanda's leader, Paul Kagame, said he spoke with Angola's President Joao Lourenco — a mediator in the conflict who also met with Congo's leader a day earlier — and both leaders committed to working with other African countries to resolve the hostilities. U.S. President Donald Trump described the conflict as a 'very serious problem' when asked about it Thursday but declined to comment further, and a U.N. spokesman said the agency is 'disturbed' by reports that neighboring Rwandan forces have crossed the border in the direction where the rebels are said to be advancing. The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion that are critical to much of the world’s technology. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, meanwhile, called on young people to enlist massively in the military, as a crucial meeting of neighbors asked the Congolese government to talk with the rebels. Rwanda's leader also threatened to 'deal' with any confrontation with South Africa, which has complained that fighting in eastern Congo has left South African peacekeepers dead. In his first public remarks since the M23 rebels advanced into Goma on Monday, Tshisekedi vowed 'a vigorous and coordinated response' from his forces to push back the rebels while reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution. On Thursday, he met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Kinshasa, the Congolese presidency said on X, noting that France has provided significant support to Congo in recent U.N. meetings on the issue. '(Congo) expects a little more action in the face of this crisis,' it added. Dead bodies, looting in Goma Goma remained largely without electricity and water on Thursday, as the bodies of several alleged government soldiers lay in the streets, horrifying residents, including children. M23 rebels escorted some 2,000 government soldiers and police officers — who they said surrendered — to an undisclosed location, some of them singing anti-Tshisekedi songs. The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Congo said basic services are largely paralyzed in Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict. 'After several days of intense clashes, the city is now (faced) with massive humanitarian needs and severely impacted response capacities,' said Bruno Lemarquis, the humanitarian coordinator. Footage from Goma showed residents carrying food items and goods looted from stores and warehouses in the city. 'This is something that is going to exacerbate a dangerous cycle of violence as desperate times call for desperate measures,' the U.N. World Food Program emergency coordinator in eastern Congo, Cynthia Jones, said Thursday. South Kivu gripped by fear After capturing much of Goma, the rebels were advancing toward South Kivu’s provincial capital, Bukavu, causing fear and panic among residents, witnesses said Thursday. Nana Bintou, a civil society leader, said gunshots and explosions were heard in Mukwinja, a captured town 135 kilometers from Bukavu. The Congolese military has been weakened after hundreds of foreign military contractors withdrew and handed over their arms to the rebels. Residents of Goma described seeing soldiers changing into civilian clothing and dropping their guns as they crossed over the border to Rwanda or took shelter in foreign peacekeeping bases. 'The (Congolese) military bases in Bukavu have been emptied to reinforce those in Nyabibwe, Bushushu, and Nyamukubi' along the way to the capital, one youth leader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was worried about his safety. Neighbors urge talks with M23 as tensions grow A summit of the regional East African bloc called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in eastern Congo and 'strongly urged' Tshisekedi’s government to hold talks with the rebels. Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from the virtual summit attended by Rwanda, also a member. While African countries as well as the U.N. and U.S. have called for an immediate ceasefire, the risk of a regional war has increased, analysts say, exacerbated by the rebels' advance into South Kivu and diatribes between Rwandan and South African officials. Congo is a member of the southern Africa regional bloc and also that of east Africa, whose peacekeeping force it expelled last year after deeming it ineffective. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa blamed the 'Rwanda Defense Force militia' for the fighting that has resulted in the deaths of 13 South African peacekeepers in eastern Congo. He also said his government will ensure the peacekeepers are 'sufficiently supported during this critical mission.' His comment drew an angry response from Kagame, who called the South African peacekeepers a 'belligerent force' working alongside armed groups that target Rwanda. 'If South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,' the Rwandan leader said on the social media platform X. Who are the M23 and what do they want? The chaotic situation with the M23 has its roots in ethnic conflict, stretching back to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when 800,000 Tutsis and others were killed by Hutus and former militias. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and others involved in the genocide. Many Hutus fled into Congo after 1994. Unlike in 2012 when the rebels seized Congo for days, observers say their withdrawal could be more difficult now. The rebels have been emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements, according to Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, a think tank. 'Ultimately, this is a failure of African mediation (because) the warning signs were always there. Kigali was adopting very bellicose rhetoric and the Congolese government was also adopting very, very aggressive rhetoric,' Mutiga said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-eastern-congo-say-they-plan-to-take-their-fight-to-the-capital/7957962.html	2025-01-30T22:07:17-08:00	
Judge extends court-monitoring agreement for children in Customs and Border Protection custody	McALLEN, TEXAS — A federal judge extended a court agreement on Thursday ensuring safe and sanitary conditions for migrant children in federal custody a day after U.S. Customs and Border Protection was set to begin self-monitoring. The agreement originally ended Wednesday, but District Judge Dolly M. Gee in California decided to extend it by 18 months. 'CBP is not yet capable of wholly fulfilling its responsibilities under the 2022 Settlement and the FSA (Flores Settlement Agreement) without the additional support provided by the JCM (Juvenile Care Monitor) and the Court,' the judge wrote in her order. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A court-appointed monitor will continue to visit and report on conditions for children in custody at U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas. Concerns were initially raised during the first Trump administration when reports surfaced of children separated from family for weeks and held in poor sanitary conditions. In 2019, a Guatemalan teenager died in custody as a result of a flu outbreak and a lack of proper medical care in a federal facility in Weslaco, Texas. The parties reached an agreement that was implemented in July 2022 for 2½ years. It allowed a court monitor to keep track of progress made by Customs and Border Protection. In the last report filed in December, the monitor noted positive changes while also mentioning a continued practice of separating some parents from their children during their time in custody. The monitor later told the court of discrepancies with Customs and Border Protection data suggesting the agency underreported the number of children who had exceeded the recommended time in custody of three days. Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to begin self-monitoring its facilities on Wednesday. The agency said in December it was ready for the task after issuing new guidance on family unity and increased training on detention policies, guidelines and regulations that rolled back court oversight under the Biden administration. Plaintiffs argued the agency was not ready, citing testimony from minors held in Customs and Border Protection facilities, and they requested the renewal of the court agreement. 'No child should be forced to spend weeks inside a windowless pod in dirty clothes with no access to the outdoors. We are relieved the Court ruled to force CBP to meet its obligations under the settlement,' Mishan Wroe, senior attorney for the National Youth Law Center, said in a statement. Trump officials have said they plan to end 'catch-and-release' policies and stop the release of migrants into the U.S. while they wait for immigration court hearings. The changes could result in longer detention times exceeding the court-recommended 72 hours for families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-extends-court-monitoring-agreement-for-children-in-customs-and-border-protection-custody/7957950.html	2025-01-30T21:00:10-08:00	
Dick Button, Olympic great and voice of skating, dies at 95	NEW YORK — Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's greatest innovators and promoters. Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause. He was 95. As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics. 'Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,' Scott Hamilton said. 'There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way.' Button's impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion — and his country's youngest at age 16 — when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event. 'By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,' Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. 'But listen, I did it and that was what counted.' That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 — no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001. In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time. 'I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,' said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. 'I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.' With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC's Wide World of Sports as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope. 'Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,' 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button's autobiography. 'He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary.' After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on Wide World. That's when he joined the network as a commentator. Button's death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world, Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community. Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor. He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years, attracting many top names in the sport — Hamilton, Torvill and Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt. Button's Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such made-for-TV programs as Battle of the Network Stars. He also dabbled in acting, but the rink was his realm. 'Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,' said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. 'He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn't a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him, and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches. 'I think that is something very special about commentating figure skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dick-button-olympic-great-and-voice-of-skating-dies-at-95/7957949.html	2025-01-30T20:52:33-08:00	
US economy grows solid 2.3% in October-December on eve of Trump return to White House	WASHINGTON — A humming American economy ended 2024 on a solid note with consumer spending continuing to drive growth, and ahead of what could be a significant change in direction under a Trump administration. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product — the economy's output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December. For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023. The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters. Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter. A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth. But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure 'suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes. President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low — 4.1% in December. The economy has proven remarkably resilient after the Fed's inflation fighters raised rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the biggest surge in consumer prices since the 1980s. Instead of sliding into a recession, as most economists predicted, GDP kept expanding. Growth has now topped 2% in nine of the last 10 quarters. On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, 'we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022. The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year. The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices. Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then 'demand'' lower interest rates – a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president. Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry. Citing the 'squeeze'' on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a commentary, 'we wouldn't be surprised to see a reversal in the first quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow marginally below 2%.'' Thursday's GDP release was the first of three Commerce Department estimates of October-December growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-economy-grows-solid-2-3-in-october-december-on-eve-of-trump-return-to-white-house/7957945.html	2025-01-30T20:40:59-08:00	
Spain struggles to meet NATO defense target, as Trump demands huge additional spending	Visiting Spain this week, NATO’s secretary-general called for members to boost military spending in the face of the threat from Russia.

Ugandan nurse dies of Ebola	A male nurse in Uganda has died of Ebola, the first recorded death by the disease in the East African country since an outbreak ended in 2023, health officials said. The 32-year-old nurse worked at Mulago National Specialised Hospital in Kampala, Diana Atwine, permanent secretary of Uganda’s health ministry, said Thursday. The nurse died Wednesday of the Sudan strain of Ebola, Atwine said. He sought treatment at several hospitals and had also consulted with a traditional healer before tests confirmed an Ebola diagnosis, health officials said. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X that his organization was supporting Uganda’s efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak in Uganda with a $1 million allocation from WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies. Atwine said on her X social media account that 'rapid response teams are fully deployed, contact tracing is underway, and all necessary measures are in place to contain the situation. We assure the public that we are in full control.' Contact tracing, however, could be challenging in Kampala, with its population of 4 million people. The health ministry, however, reported that it had identified 44 contacts of the late nurse, which included 30 other health care workers. The symptoms of Ebola, an often fatal disease, include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and at times internal and external bleeding. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care workers and family members caring for someone with Ebola are at high risk for contracting the disease. WHO said Ebola 'is transmitted to people from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then spreads in the human population through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g., bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.' Ebola’s fatality rate is around 50%, WHO said on its website, but it also said that fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in some outbreaks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ugandan-nurse-dies-of-ebola/7957916.html	2025-01-30T18:18:08-08:00	
Emotional reunions plus chaos as Hamas and allies release more hostages	Three more Israeli hostages and five Thai workers are back in Israel after being freed as part of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

Washington crash mars long record of US aviation safety	A collision between a passenger jet and U.S. Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport late Wednesday marked the first time in more than 15 years that there had been a mass fatality event in U.S. airspace related to commercial aviation. The accident, which killed a reported 67 people, took place while American Airlines Flight 5342 was making its final approach to the runway. The Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet and the Sikorsky H-60, commonly known as a Black Hawk, collided only a few hundred meters above the ground, officials said. The plane was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members. There were three service members aboard the military helicopter, including the pilot. Both aircraft crashed into the icy waters of the Potomac River, and authorities said Thursday that they didn't believe there were any survivors. The accident took place in darkness at 8:47 p.m., and no significant weather problems were reported. As of Thursday, authorities had not identified the cause of the accident. However, The New York Times on Thursday, citing an 'internal preliminary Federal Aviation Administration safety report' it reviewed, reported that staffing at the airport's air traffic control tower was 'not normal' Wednesday night. The newspaper said a single air traffic controller was directing incoming and outgoing plane traffic as well as helicopter traffic in the area. Those jobs are usually split between two controllers. Experts consider crash an anomaly Aviation experts said as tragic as the accident was, it should be considered an anomaly in an air traffic system that has been notably free of major disasters for many years. 'Some of it was luck. Some of it is technology. And mostly it was the tremendous job that the pilots and air traffic controllers do,' former United Airlines pilot Captain Ross 'Rusty' Aimer told VOA. 'They literally perform miracles every day because our system is extremely congested everywhere you go. ... And Washington National Airport is, perhaps in my 60 years in aviation, one of the most demanding and busiest airports in the world.' It is necessary to look back to 2009 to find a comparable commercial disaster in U.S. airspace. At that time, a Colgan Air jet en route from New Jersey to Buffalo, New York, stalled during its approach and crashed into a house, killing 49 passengers and crew, as well as one individual in the house. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines jet crashed while landing in San Francisco, California. Two passengers who were not wearing seat belts were killed when they were thrown from the plane, and another person died after being struck by an emergency response vehicle on the tarmac. There were 187 other people who suffered injuries, many serious, but no other fatalities. While there have been a number of other high-profile incidents involving U.S. airlines recently, none involved mass casualties. Last year, for example, a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max in midflight, but the plane landed safely, though some passengers suffered minor injuries. Experts stressed that such events occur in only a tiny fraction of the millions of flights that take place in the U.S. every year. Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst and former senior airline executive, told VOA that the U.S. commercial aviation industry experiences an extremely low level of safety incidents and 'an even lower level of fatality accidents.' 'That's not luck, that's effort,' he said. 'We're thankful to have so many professionals in the operating environment. In the oversight environment, focus on safety is the number one priority.' Crash occurs in crowded airspace The accident took place in one of the most crowded — and highly regulated — sectors of airspace in the United States. The Washington region has three major airports, 11 regional airports and dozens of heliports — not counting the multiple military installations in the region with aviation operations. Keith M. Cianfrani, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who served as a flight instructor and an accident investigator, told VOA he flew helicopters in the area where the accident took place while on active duty and later as a commercial pilot. 'It's congested,' said Cianfrani, who now works as an aviation safety consultant and adjunct professor at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. 'So, it's not unusual to cross the path of an incoming [plane] as long as there is traffic separation.' Traffic separation refers to the distance, in time and space, between aircraft in the same area. But because of the congestion, there are very clear rules about where aircraft are allowed to be and when they can be there, Cianfrani said. Helicopters are required to follow specific routes when passing through the region, he said, calling it 'very uncommon' to see something like Wednesday's crash take place. 'As a whole, the general aviation industry in the United States is outstanding,' he said. 'They all have to adhere to what we call SMS — safety management systems. On a regular basis, they get audited. They have an internal audit program, and they're constantly being looked at by people like myself going in and auditing their safety program. So, it's outstanding.' Turnover in federal aviation oversight Wednesday's accident took place at a time when leadership of the federal agencies in charge of flight safety is being overhauled by the new administration of President Donald Trump. The day after his inauguration, Trump dismissed Transportation Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, which provides the federal government with recommendations for aviation safety. He also initiated a hiring freeze, preventing the hiring of new air traffic controllers. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), was sworn in the day before the crash. Michael Whitaker, who served as administrator of the FAA in former President Joe Biden's administration, announced in December that he would resign his post on January 20, the day Trump took office. The new president has not yet nominated a permanent replacement for Whitaker, but on Thursday he named Chris Rocheleau, a former Air Force officer who has spent more than 20 years at the FAA, as interim administrator. Trump spreads blame With recovery teams still searching for bodies in the Potomac River on Thursday, Trump held a press conference and attempted to pin blame for the accident on the previous presidential administration. He asserted, with no proof or evidence, that the Biden administration had lowered hiring standards for air traffic controllers as part of its 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' efforts. Trump took particular aim at former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, saying he had driven the agency 'right into the ground with his diversity.' Buttigieg responded with a post on the social media platform X. 'Despicable,' Buttigieg wrote. 'As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch. 'President Trump now oversees the military and the FAA,' he added. 'One of his first acts was to fire and suspend some of the key personnel who helped keep our skies safe. Time for the President to show actual leadership and explain what he will do to prevent this from happening again.'

Experts: Trump faces tough task to denuclearize North Korea	washington — The White House says President Donald Trump is going to pursue the denuclearization of North Korea, although analysts say that is easier said than done. White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told VOA Korean via email this week that 'President Trump had a good relationship with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un,' and that Trump’s 'mix of toughness and diplomacy led to the first-ever leader-level commitment to complete denuclearization.' Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, in Singapore, Hanoi and over the inter-Korean border at Panmunjom. Trump, who has recently called North Korea 'a nuclear power,' said in an interview with Fox News last week that he would reach out to Kim again, adding, 'He liked me, and I got along with him.' Commitment to denuclearization Former U.S. government officials say there is no doubt that Trump is serious about resuming talks with Kim. Susan Thornton, a former senior U.S. diplomat for Asian affairs, told VOA Korean on Wednesday via email it 'seems clear that President Trump plans to pick up where he left off with Kim Jong Un in his first administration.' Thornton, who was acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the first Trump administration, said Trump would 'like to hold Kim and North Korea to the 2018 Singapore joint statement that included Kim’s commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.' However, 'much has changed since then, and Kim’s hand is stronger, so it won’t be easy,' Thornton said, referring to Pyongyang’s development of more advanced weapons. The state-run Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported Wednesday that Kim said it was 'indispensable' to bolster nuclear forces, as North Korea continues to face 'confrontations with the most vicious, hostile countries.' Last Saturday, the North test-fired what it said were sea-to-surface strategic cruise-guided missiles. Kim, who inspected the test launch, said the country’s war deterrence means are 'being perfected more thoroughly,' according to KCNA. Evans Revere, former acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific affairs during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on the phone Wednesday that Kim would agree to come back to the table if he believed reengaging with Washington 'could help him attain any of his own goals with respect to his nuclear and missile programs and relations with the United States.' Revere is skeptical that any of Kim’s goals would include his regime’s denuclearization. 'The North Koreans might dangle the possibility of a discussion about denuclearization to attract the United States into a dialogue, but it would not be a serious proposal,' he said. 'Quite frankly, they are determined to keep their weapons, keep their capabilities, which they regard as essential to their own existence.' Daunting task Frank Aum, a senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace who worked at the Department of Defense from 2010 to 2017, said denuclearization is not a realistic goal to achieve in the near or medium term. 'The best thing Trump can do to increase the odds of North Korea’s engagement is to resolve Russia’s war in Ukraine, which would decrease North Korea’s leverage and signal that a U.S. offer better than the one in Hanoi might be on the table,' Aum said in an email to VOA Korean. North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia to help Moscow in its war against Ukraine. In return, North Korea has received military or financial assistance, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. The February 2019 talks, in which Trump and Kim met for the second time, collapsed after Kim asked for full lifting of sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of the country’s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, about 100 kilometers north of Pyongyang. Trump demanded more should be done on Kim’s end. Aum said Kim would likely not have budged from his position then. 'Trump may probe to see if he can get Kim to accept partial sanctions relief instead, like he tried at Hanoi, or offer more for Yongbyon,' Aum said. 'It seems clear that Kim will not offer any more security concessions than Yongbyon.' Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA Korean via email on Wednesday that 'for now, it is unlikely any meeting, if it takes place, will reasonably be related to denuclearization.' 'Trump will likely seek to keep the ultimate goal of denuclearization alive while exploring ways in which to reduce the threat,' Seiler said. Referring to recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the failure of sanctions to halt the North Korean nuclear program, Seiler speculated that sanctions relief may be offered for significant steps in the new talks between Washington and Pyongyang. Seiler added that military exercises and extended deterrence may also be reduced in terms of their frequency, volume and scale, in exchange for a halt or slowing of Kim's long-range missile launches and nuclear tests. In June 2018, Trump decided to suspend major military exercises with South Korea in an apparent gesture of good faith, right after his first meeting with Kim in Singapore. It raised some fears among South Koreans that such a move could weaken defense against the North.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-trump-faces-tough-task-to-denuclearize-north-korea-/7957893.html	2025-01-30T17:24:50-08:00	
Foreign officials begin meeting Syria's interim president	Foreign dignitaries and officials are beginning to travel to Syria to meet with Ahmed al-Sharaa, the country's newly appointed transitional president. Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the first head of state to visit Damascus, Syria's capital, and meet with Sharaa. The Qatari royal court said the emir discussed with Sharaa 'the urgent need to form a government that represents all segments of the Syrian people.' Before being appointed to his current role, Sharaa was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to wrest control of the country from President Bashar al-Assad. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Qatar has been a longtime supporter of Syria's opposition. The foreign ministers of both countries held a press conference Thursday. 'The Syrian people won't forget Qatar's committed position while we open a new chapter in a new Syria,' Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani said. Qatar is looking forward to providing Syria with additional aid in the electrical and infrastructure arenas, Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed al-Khulaifi said. Promise of inclusive government On Wednesday, the commanders of the military factions that toppled the former regime named Sharaa, who has served as the de facto head of government since the fall of Assad, as president during the formation of a new government. Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, is facing the daunting task of forming a temporary legislative council for the transitional period, as the previous parliament has been dissolved. Syria's constitution has also been annulled, and a new charter will be adopted. No timeline for the creation of a new parliament and constitution has been announced. Sharaa has promised to create an inclusive government and eventually elections. The elections could take as long as four years to arrange, Sharaa said, according to Reuters. Russians, Palestinians visit On Tuesday, delegations from Russia and the Palestinian Authority arrived in Syria. The Russian delegation included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy for Syria, according to RIA Novosti. There was no official government comment on the itinerary of the Russian officials. However, the Russians were expected to meet with Sharaa and Syria's foreign minister, according to the semiofficial Al Watan newspaper. Syria has not cut all ties with Russia, where Assad is living in exile. Russian troops and assets remain in Syria, but they have all been relocated to Hmeimim Air Base, The Associated Press reported. A Palestinian Authority delegation that included Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa was in Syria on Tuesday to meet with Sharaa, but no details have been released. At one point, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, according to the AP. The bounty was removed recently after a U.S. delegation met him in Damascus. In a video released after the meeting with the Syrian factions, Sharaa said one of his top priorities would be filling 'in a legitimate and legal way' Syria's government. Another priority, he said, will be 'maintaining civil peace by seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks' due to Assad's reign. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-officials-begin-meeting-syria-s-interim-president/7957853.html	2025-01-30T17:08:21-08:00	
Analysts consider ramifications of ECOWAS members’ exit	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The departure of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from West Africa’s most influential bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), raises concerns, especially in the areas of security and economics, according to regional analysts who spoke with VOA. Some say the split — the first time nations have quit the regional body since its creation a half-century ago — could weaken joint military operations and further destabilize the Sahel, a region already struggling with jihadist insurgencies. But on Wednesday, the day the decision was formally recognized by the bloc, ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray told reporters in Abuja that the bloc was willing to continue security cooperation despite the split. ECOWAS also announced that its 'doors remain open' to the departing nations and urged the remaining 12 member states to continue to support them. 'I think that ECOWAS has taken a pragmatic approach about the unfolding situation,' said Rotimi Olawale, a political affairs analyst. 'I expect also that there would be continued cooperation around security issues. Issues of peace and security pose a big challenge.' Junta-led Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso officially quit the regional body on Wednesday after a yearlong notice. Relations between ECOWAS and the departing trio of member states soured after a July 2023 coup in Niger, which led ECOWAS to threaten military intervention. In 2023, the three states formed their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, seeking closer ties with Russia. Touray said ECOWAS plans to hold a technical session with the three countries to discuss the way forward. Chris Kwaja, the Nigerian director at the United States Institute of Peace, said 'there are so many issues, so I think a technical session of that nature is important to allow each party to weigh where it stands on the issue of separation.' Trade is one of them. Analysts say economic challenges may loom large for the three departing nations, especially regarding access to maritime ports to the south. 'The countries will get to a point where they will seek at the very least greater cooperation with ECOWAS countries, as they would require access to the port,' said Olawale. 'The three countries are landlocked, so they'll continue to depend on the subregion for trade partnership to ensure that they continue to have a booming economy. My predictions are that the three countries are coming back to ECOWAS, perhaps not in the short term.' In recent years, ECOWAS, which was founded to promote economic integration, has faced increasing challenges in maintaining stability across the region. Kwaja said public sentiment toward ECOWAS is shifting because some citizens view the bloc as an entity that primarily protects the interests of regional leaders rather than the masses. 'ECOWAS was a bit detached from its citizens,' said Kwaja. 'Now a big lesson for ECOWAS should be to invest heavily in the people, back to the point about the ECOWAS agenda of moving away from an ECOWAS [of] state to an ECOWAS of the people, because the people constitute the pillar upon which ECOWAS is [sitting].' The Sahel region has become the world’s deadliest terrorism hot spot, accounting for the highest number of terror-related deaths last year. The outcome of the looming technical session remains uncertain, and many will be watching to see how ECOWAS moves past its most significant political crisis in decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-consider-ramifications-of-ecowas-members-exit/7957552.html	2025-01-30T17:00:29-08:00

US lawmakers weigh cost of foreign aid freeze in competition with China	U.S. lawmakers Thursday weighed the impact that President Donald Trump's 90-day foreign aid freeze will have on competition with China. Trump signed an executive order within hours of being sworn in as president ordering a halt to all U.S. international assistance while the new administration determines whether the aid aligns with his 'America First' policy. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said the move was a necessary step to prioritize fiscal responsibility as the U.S. faces a debt of $36 trillion. 'This is obviously a work in progress,' Risch, a Republican from Idaho, said Thursday. 'It was intended to underscore the fact that we're going into debt at the rate of $1 trillion every 100 days. I think that has certainly been underscored as a result of this. If you think this is bad, when our debtors come and want their money and we can't pay it, that's going to be really bad,' Risch said. 'It's caused everyone to take a breath and look at how we're spending our money, where we're spending our money, seeing that it's done as efficiently as possible. Admittedly, there have been some inconveniences along the line, but they're continuing to work on this.' Democrats said the pause in aid creates a void that will be filled by the People's Republic of China (PRC). 'I'm particularly concerned about the expansion of China's influence, both at home and abroad, as a result of a freeze on our foreign assistance — and, in particular, the way it's implemented in its cascading effect,' Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in a hearing about Chinese influence abroad. 'There is nothing China wants to do more than limit the reach of our global influence, than to reinforce its imprint,' Coons added. '[That way] we're an unreliable partner with countries throughout the world and particularly in the Global South, and my concern is that we put our security, our economic and our diplomatic interest at risk with an abrupt pause that puts a halt to actions to counter malign activity by the PRC, to advance to invest in infrastructure.' But Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Democrats should not be the only ones concerned about evaluating and restoring the aid. 'I hope that all of you on the other side of the aisle will share your concerns with the administration and point out that this is not a partisan issue,' she said. 'This is about what are we going to do to ensure that our influence continues around the world in the interest of our own national security.' Around the world, U.S.-funded foreign aid programs have already begun shutting down their programming and laying off staff in the wake of the freeze. The U.S. is the world's largest foreign aid provider but is outspent by China in some areas. According to the Government Accountability Office, between 2013 and 2022, China spent $679 billion on global infrastructure projects compared with the United States' $76 billion. 'Foreign aid is a really important arrow in the quiver of U.S. national security, along with other tools such as diplomacy, military assistance and so on,' Jennifer Lind, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College, told lawmakers Thursday. 'And so ideally, we would want to be using all of our different tools in a coordinated fashion to achieve our objectives. For that reason, I think it's understandable if the administration wants to take a short pause and assess: Are we using the right tools in the right way?' But Melanie Hart of the Atlantic Council said the freeze 'is hobbling America's ability to compete with China in every domain.' 'Over $1 billion more foreign military financing for Taiwan. Frozen. NDI [National Democratic Institute] and IRI [International Republican Institute] are shutting down global operations. Human rights organizations — frozen,' she said. 'Washington has effectively abandoned the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.' Hart said she understood the administration's desire to maximize the strategic focus of the aid and appreciated the State Department's waivers, but that 'this broad freeze hobbles America at a moment when we are in the battle of the century.' 'It is a massive gift to Beijing. The longer it goes on, the harder it will be to regain the ground we are already losing today, tomorrow and this week,' Hart said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a waiver last Friday unfreezing emergency food assistance and earlier this week issued another waiver unfreezing humanitarian assistance. The top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with China on Thursday welcomed Rubio's waivers but said more had to be done. 'While periodic review of foreign assistance programs' contribution to U.S. national security is necessary, abruptly freezing any foreign assistance directly cedes ground to our foremost adversary: the CCP,' said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. 'At a time when the CCP is aggressively investing abroad, rerouting supply chains and buying authoritarian favor, the United States must double down on foreign assistance — not kneecap ourselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-weigh-cost-of-foreign-aid-freeze-in-competition-with-china/7957852.html	2025-01-30T16:24:42-08:00	
Zelenskyy condemns Russian strike that killed 9 as ‘terrible tragedy’	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned an early Thursday morning Russian drone strike that killed at least nine people as a 'terrible tragedy.' The drone, which struck an apartment building in the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, also injured 13 people, according to regional authorities. 'This is a terrible tragedy, a terrible Russian crime. It is very important that the world does not stop putting pressure on Russia for this terror,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. Police said the search-and-rescue operation had concluded after 19 hours. Three elderly couples were among those killed, and an 8-year-old child was among those wounded. The child’s mother was killed in the attack. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin claims to be ready for negotiations, but this is what he actually does,' Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on social media. Russia launched 81 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian military said Thursday. The attacks damaged businesses and homes around the country, according to the military. In the southern region of Odesa, the attack damaged a grain warehouse and a hospital, according to the governor. Meanwhile, James Anderson, a British man who was captured while fighting on the Ukrainian side in Russia’s Kursk region, will face terrorism and mercenary charges, Russian state investigators said Thursday. Russia announced in November that it had captured Anderson. Also, the review and 90-day freeze on U.S. foreign aid means Ukrainian aid groups that rely on U.S. funding are being forced to cut services. Zelenskyy said U.S. military assistance to Ukraine was not affected by U.S. President Donald Trump’s freeze on foreign aid, but the Ukrainian president still expressed concern about the funding pause. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-condemns-russian-strike-that-killed-9-as-terrible-tragedy-/7957549.html	2025-01-30T15:12:04-08:00

After fires, Los Angeles gets moonshot moment to rebuild	As Los Angeles recovers from its devastating wildfires, environmental engineers, urban planners and natural disaster experts are casting forward with visions of what could come next for neighborhoods that have been reduced to ash and rubble. Apartment buildings could spring up where strip malls and parking lots once stood, with locals walking to ground-floor shops, offices and cafes, European-style. The city could 'infill' vertically to add affordable housing in safer downtown areas, rather than outwards with more single-family homes on fire-prone hills. Some blocks could be turned into buffer zones, where no building was allowed. And the city's trademark palm trees, which burn like Roman candles, could be replaced with fire-resistant native trees. These are some of the bold ideas academics have for Los Angeles as it recovers from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which killed 28 people and damaged or destroyed nearly 16,000 structures. Together, the blazes charred 152 square kilometers — an area larger than Paris. The city is far from rebuilding, with many people only now being allowed back to their burned neighborhoods. When construction does begin, few of the dozen experts Reuters spoke to expected their dream plans to be adopted, citing factors ranging from lack of future insurance coverage to political pressure to rebuild as before. Nonetheless, experts in urban development, climate change and housing said Los Angeles has a chance to think outside the box. Many also said there should be no rush to rebuild. Instead, residents of Pacific Palisades and Altadena should be afforded time to decide what their future communities should look like and dream big. 'The biggest thing is how do we promote infill development in safer areas,' said Emily Schlickman, assistant professor of landscape architecture and environmental design at the University of California, Davis, who suggests retreating from fire-prone peripheries. Model cities Los Angeles could learn from cities like Kobe, Japan, decimated by a 1995 earthquake, where officials imposed a two-month building moratorium, said Columbia University's Jeffrey Schlegelmilch. 'One of the most important things is to give yourself time to come up with a robust solution,' said Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the university's climate school. Then there are Houston's Harris County and the city of San Antonio, Texas, which bought up homes and properties to reduce future flood risk. In the case of Harris County, authorities offered willing sellers pre-flood market values for homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 then demolished them. Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at Pomona College in Claremont, California, is among those who point to Texas' experience. While buying up properties in Pacific Palisades and Altadena would be costly, Miller said, it would be possible with the financial support of the city, county, state and possibly insurers. Burned-out lots could be turned into what he envisions as fire buffer zones. While disruptive to residents, Miller believes many would be willing to use the money to relocate. 'People go, 'Yeah, I don't want to be in danger, and you're buying me out. Yeah, thank you,'' said Miller. He despairs at city and state efforts to fast-track redevelopment in areas that burned at a similar housing density. 'They just pulled the plug on the moonshot,' Miller said. Alice Hill, a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wants to see more green spaces like playing fields and bike paths between fire-risk areas and homes. 'It simply is unsafe to rebuild communities where they were, and retreating may be the wisest approach,' Hill wrote in a Jan. 14 essay. A little more panache Other experts advocate rebuilding the communities but in a way that will resist fire. 'The only way to do this impactfully is to do it communitywide so if the fire gets in, it has a hard time moving on,' said Michael Gollner, a professor of mechanical engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Gollner tests prototype houses to see how they handle flames. Homes can be made more fire-resistant by moving a wooden fence back five feet (1.5 meters), surrounding a house with gravel and putting mesh over attic vents to stop embers, he said. Then there is landscaping, a contentious subject for some homeowners. 'Who wants to cut down their juniper? But come a wildfire, your juniper is a torch,' said Gollner. Ecologists suggest Los Angelenos replace palms, junipers and eucalyptus with trees that evolved to survive fire, such as California oaks. The species has thick bark that resists flames and leathery leaves that burn slowly. 'There are lots of people who are working to plant oaks, and I think there's some effort in giving them more panache,' said Alexandra Syphard, a San Diego-based wildfire ecologist at the Conservation Biology Institute. For Hussam Mahmoud, a professor in civil and environmental engineering at Colorado State University, the key is predicting the path of future fires. He has developed a model that calculates which buildings will burn, allowing a community to fire-harden 'super spreader' structures, rather than fully adapt every house to resist wildfires. Hardening a home begins with using metal or concrete for a roof and fire-retardant materials on the sides.

Republican senator airs concerns about supporting RFK Jr to be US health secretary	WASHINGTON — A key Republican senator on Thursday said he was struggling with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination by President Donald Trump to run the top U.S. health agency, saying he had reservations about the nominee's 'misleading arguments' on vaccines. 'Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me,' Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician from Louisiana, told Kennedy. 'I have been struggling with the nomination,' he said at the end of Thursday's Senate health committee hearing to consider Kennedy to run the massive Department of Health and Human Services. 'Does a 70-year-old man ... who spent decades criticizing vaccines and who's financially vested in finding fault with vaccines, can he change his attitudes and approach now that he'll have the most important position influencing vaccine policy in the United States?' Cassidy said. The hearing was the second in two days for Kennedy during which he squared off with Democrats and some Republicans over his past comments on vaccines, abortion and COVID-19 among other topics. The Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before on Wednesday, has not yet said if it will send Kennedy's nomination to the full Republican-controlled Senate, which has not rejected any of Trump's nominees so far. A spokesperson for the Finance Committee said a vote could potentially take place next week, but that one had not yet been scheduled. Cassidy, who sits on both committees, told Kennedy at the end of Thursday's hearing that Kennedy would be hearing from him over the weekend, presumably regarding questions he has over the nomination. Kennedy's nomination could fail to move to the Senate for consideration if all Democrats on the Finance Committee voted against him and were joined by Cassidy. During wide-ranging questioning on Thursday, Kennedy spoke more confidently than the day prior, adjusting the characterization of previous statements, and saying he would support the U.S. children's vaccination schedule, research and development for bird flu, and scientific data on vaccine safety. Kennedy also said he would address rapidly increasing rates of chronic disease. 'Our country is not going to be destroyed because we get the marginal tax rate wrong. It is going to be destroyed if we get this issue wrong,' he said of chronic diseases. 'And I am in a unique position to be able to stop this epidemic.' He was asked about comments he has made over decades, including that it was 'highly likely' that Lyme disease was a military bioweapon. He said he never said that it was definitively created in a biolab. He would not answer a question from Senator Bernie Sanders about whether he agreed that vaccines do not cause autism. He also said he did not know if the coronavirus vaccine saved millions of lives. 'If you come out unequivocally, 'vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism' that would have an incredible impact,' Cassidy said. Kennedy has said vaccines are linked to autism, and he opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The causes of autism are unclear, though theories that childhood vaccines cause autism have been widely debunked and are contrary to scientific evidence. Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, argued during both hearings that he was not against vaccines. The group has sued in state and federal courts over vaccines. 'News reports and many in the hearing yesterday have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine and anti-industry. Well, I'm neither,' Kennedy said, repeating that his children are vaccinated. Thursday's hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is a courtesy hearing with no vote involved. However, Republican Senators Cassidy, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins sit on the committee, all of whom are seen as potential swing votes against Kennedy. Supporters of Kennedy wearing 'Make America Healthy Again' hats crowded around the committee hearing room on Thursday, while some opposing his confirmation wore 'Reject RFK Jr' stickers on their shirts. 'Catastrophic' impacts If confirmed, Kennedy would run HHS, which oversees more than $3 trillion in healthcare spending, including at the Food and Drug Administration and the agency in charge of the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs covering nearly half of all Americans. He said he would follow Trump's direction on abortion and would hire for his department those who are against abortion rights. Kennedy also said gender-affirming care for children has 'catastrophic' impacts and that children are not equipped to make judgments about receiving such care. He said he would rescind a Biden-era rule that requires medical providers who receive federal funding to offer gender-affirming care. Kennedy said farmers should be offered an off-ramp from chemically intensive agriculture, and that illness in farm communities is 'undoubtedly' related to the use of pesticides. Some farm and food groups have expressed concern about Kennedy's positions on pesticides and food additives. Opposition groups have ramped up their efforts to persuade Republican senators to vote against Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy, another member of the storied American political family, on Tuesday urged senators to vote against her cousin's nomination, calling him a predator with dangerous views on health care. Kennedy has also faced scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter Kennedy wrote to an HHS ethics official released last week. If confirmed, Kennedy would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said. If his nomination goes to the full Senate, Kennedy would need the support of at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President JD Vance to cast another tie-breaking vote to confirm his nomination.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republican-senator-airs-concerns-about-supporting-rfk-jr-to-be-us-health-secretary/7957459.html	2025-01-30T14:17:33-08:00

US ban on gun sales to adults under age 21 is unconstitutional, court rules	A decades-old U.S. government ban on federally licensed firearms dealers selling handguns to adults under the age of 21 is unconstitutional, a U.S. appeals court held on Thursday, citing recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings expanding gun rights. The ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marked the first time a federal appeals court has held that the prohibition violated the right to keep and bear arms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. The appeals court had previously upheld that same ban in 2012. But that was before the 6-3 conservative majority U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark ruling in 2022 that established a new test for assessing modern firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court held that modern gun restrictions were required to be 'consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.' The federal ban on sales to people under 21 was first adopted by Congress in 1968 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. A group of individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 along with the gun rights groups the Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation challenged the ban in 2020 and was appealing a lower-court judge's decision upholding the statutes. U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, writing for Thursday's three-judge panel, said that decision was wrong, as the statutes were 'unconstitutional in light of our Nation's historic tradition of firearm regulation.' The U.S. Department of Justice during Democratic former President Joe Biden's tenure had defended the ban. But Jones said it put forth 'scant' evidence to show that the gun rights of adults ages 18 to 20 were similarly restricted during the nation's founding era in the 1700s. 'Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,' wrote Jones, who like the other panel members was appointed by a Republican president. Brandon Combs, the Firearms Policy Coalition's president, in a statement called the ruling a victory against 'an immoral and unconstitutional age-based gun ban.' The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-ban-on-gun-sales-to-adults-under-age-21-is-unconstitutional-court-rules-/7957454.html	2025-01-30T13:36:56-08:00

East African leaders call for ceasefire in DRC; humanitarian crisis worsens	NAIROBI, KENYA — East African Community leaders on Wednesday called for an immediate ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where government forces are fighting rebel group M23, while aid agencies say the clashes are deepening the already dire humanitarian crisis there. Kenyan President William Ruto led an online meeting for seven of eight of the trade bloc's heads of state. The only member not participating was Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. In a statement afterward, the leaders called on the warring parties to cease hostilities in eastern Congo and facilitate humanitarian access to the affected areas. The summit also asked the DRC government to protect diplomatic missions in the country, following attacks this week by protesters in the capital, Kinshasa, targeting embassies of several countries presumed to be sympathetic to the M23 rebel group. The Congolese government has accused Rwanda of supporting M23, which this week took control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. Witnesses reported seeing bodies in the streets, but local officials have not determined a death toll. The Congolese government said it is fighting to push out the rebels from the city of 2 million. Edgar Githua, an international relations analyst in Nairobi, said animosity between Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame could derail any ceasefire talks. 'There’s still a lot of bad blood between DRC and Rwanda on how to approach this issue because DRC believes that these are Rwandese, and Kagame categorically keeps on saying M23 are not Rwandese, these are ethnic Tutsis who are Congolese by citizenship,' Githua said. 'It is only that they share a language with Rwanda. So, this issue of identity is what is ailing this conflict and needs to be addressed deeply.' Meanwhile, aid agencies say these latest clashes have made the dire humanitarian crisis in DRC even worse, as thousands of Goma residents, many of whom were already displaced due to earlier conflict, are forced to flee again. Maina King’ori, the acting country director for CARE International in DRC, told VOA from Goma, 'There’s been no electricity supply for the last several days in most parts of Goma. The water system is not functioning; it has been shut down, though slowly coming back in some places, and there has been no internet connectivity in Goma for the last three days. This makes living really difficult.' King’ori urged parties to the conflict to adhere to international humanitarian law and protect civilians. 'Civilians cannot be a target,' he said. 'Civilians are not party to this conflict, yet they’re having to bear the immense load. … They’re the ones that are having to feel the pain of sleeping outside, of being relocated several times, of losing loved ones.' Democratic Republic of Congo is grappling with a decadeslong crisis that humanitarian agencies say has left over 6 million people displaced, with recent hostilities exacerbating their plight. North Kivu, where Goma is located, hosts over 2.7 million internally displaced people, according to CARE International.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-african-leaders-call-for-ceasefire-in-drc-humanitarian-crisis-worsens/7957409.html	2025-01-30T13:11:35-08:00	
Immigrant neighborhoods in Chicago on edge amid federal enforcement actions	CHICAGO — Alderman Michael Rodriguez represents Chicago's 22nd Ward, including the 'Little Village' neighborhood on the west side of the city. Outside his office windows, he has an up-close view of 26th Street, an important thoroughfare with stores and merchants attracting immigrants from across the region. '26th Street is known as the capital of the Mexican Midwest,' Rodriguez told VOA. 'Our local economy here is thriving and is a generous tax base for the whole region.' A 2020 study by the Delta Institute says the Little Village provides about $900 million in annual tax revenue for Chicago, the second-highest amount for the city. But as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and other agents fan out across the area amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the usually bustling 26th Street is noticeably quieter. 'My community members are in absolute fear,' Rodriguez said. One way his office prepared for the crackdown was sharing information with the community about their rights. 'We've held workshops for our businesses knowing their rights. We've passed out 'Know your Rights' cards outside of grocery stores. There are other organizations and entities going door to door talking to neighbors and letting them know what their rights are,' he said. White House 'Border Czar' Tom Homan was in Chicago observing federal law enforcement efforts. In an interview at the White House on Wednesday, he explained to VOA that law-abiding immigrants in the country legally are not the focus of the crackdown. 'Right now, we are concentrating on public safety threats and national security threats. That's our number one goal,' Homan said. 'So, we've got all of our government operations. It's not just ICE looking for these criminal aliens — it's DEA, and FBI, and ATF and U.S. Marshals Services. … It's an all-government approach to look for criminal aliens throughout the United States. We're going to hit every city in this country and arrest those that are in the country illegally that have a criminal conviction.' A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump enables ICE officers to enter sensitive locations such as schools and churches to apprehend suspects, Homan said in an interview Sunday on ABC's 'This Week.' 'ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat is in one of these facilities. Then it should be an option for them to make the arrest,' Homan told ABC. 'We're really concerned for the safety of our families,' said Cristina De La Rosa, executive director of Erie House, a nonprofit organization that assists immigrants in the Little Village neighborhood. 'We've already experienced some participants that are not coming to our sites or keeping their kids at home, so we want them to know that we are prepared, as well.' De La Rosa said her organization has moved some services online for those reluctant to visit offices. 'We've definitely experienced less people on the streets, for sure,' she told VOA. 'I think that unfortunately, there's been a lot of chaos, as well, because of the fear.' De La Rosa said concerns among community members she talks to extend beyond fear of deportation. 'A lot of the organizations in the community, we rely on government dollars to do a lot of the work that we do in our communities. And so, I think this is just one of the many ways our work is going to be impacted,' she said. At a city press conference on Wednesday, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters that federal law enforcement agencies were providing updates to his department on their enforcement actions. 'What I can tell you right now is that we don't have an exact number of Chicago people who have been detained,' Snelling said. 'But what I can tell you is that the number in the Chicagoland area exceeds 100.' Mayor Brandon Johnson tried to reassure the public that Chicago was still a city that welcomed immigrants. 'Chicago is a city that opens its arms to people from around the globe,' he said. 'We will continue to protect civil and human rights, and we welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city.'

US-born girl shot dead by father in Pakistan over TikTok videos, police say	QUETTA, Pakistan — A Pakistani man suspected of killing his U.S.-born 15-year-old daughter in a so-called honor killing after she apparently refused to stop sharing videos on TikTok appeared in court Thursday in the southwestern city of Quetta, police said. The shooting happened on a street in the southwestern city of Quetta on Tuesday. The suspect, Anwar ul-Haq, initially said that unidentified gunmen shot and killed his daughter before he confessed to the crime Wednesday, police official Babar Baloch said. 'Our investigation so far has found that the family had an objection to her dressing, lifestyle and social gathering,' another police investigator, Zohaib Mohsin, said. 'We have her phone. It is locked,' he told Reuters. 'We are probing all aspects, including honor killing.' The family had recently returned to Balochistan province in predominantly Muslim Pakistan, a nation with conservative social norms, having lived in the United States for about 25 years, Baloch said. The suspect has U.S. citizenship, the officer said. He said Haq had told him his daughter began creating 'objectionable' content on the social media platform TikTok when she lived in the United States. He told police that she continued to share videos on the platform after returning to Pakistan. Baloch said the main suspect's brother-in-law had also been arrested in connection with the killing. Police said they had charged Haq with the killing. They did not offer proof of Haq's U.S. citizenship except for the suspect's own testimony and declined to say whether the U.S. Embassy had been informed of the incident. His family declined to respond to a Reuters request for comment. More than 54 million people use TikTok in Pakistan, a nation of 241 million. The government has blocked the video-sharing app several times in recent years over content moderation. Islamabad often takes issue with what it terms 'obscene content' with the social media platform, which has lately started complying with requests from Pakistan to remove certain content. Over 1,000 women are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of community or family members over perceived damage to 'honor,' according to independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. That could involve eloping, posting social media content, fraternizing with men, or any other infraction against conservative values relating to women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-born-girl-shot-dead-by-father-in-pakistan-over-tiktok-videos-police-say/7957369.html	2025-01-30T12:34:24-08:00	
Trump signs order to plan US's 250th anniversary, punish statue vandals	NEW YORK — U.S. President Donald Trump is making plans to celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence and create a new national sculpture garden while reviving efforts to harshly punish those who vandalize or destroy existing statues and monuments. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday establishing a White House task force to plan what he says will be a 'grand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence,' which the country will celebrate on July 4, 2026. Trump will serve as chair of the task force, which will include a long list of senior administration officials, including Cabinet secretaries. The order also revives Trump's plans to build a 'National Garden of American Heroes' with statues memorializing 250 historical figures. Trump first announced plans for what he said would be 'a new monument to the giants of our past' in a 2020 speech celebrating Independence Day at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. It was to have featured sculptures of dozens of American historical figures, including presidents, athletes and pop culture icons. Trump himself curated the list of who was to be included — Davy Crockett, Billy Graham, Whitney Houston, Harriet Tubman and Antonin Scalia, among others. No site was selected, however, and the garden was never funded by Congress. President Joe Biden abolished the task force after his election. Trump's announcement had come at a time of conservative backlash against efforts to take down statues dedicated to Confederate leaders and slave owners in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and subsequent protests. 'The National Garden will honor American heroism after dozens of monuments to Americans, including Presidents and Founding Fathers, have toppled or destroyed and never restored,' said a White House document on the order shared with The Associated Press ahead of the signing. Wednesday’s action also puts back into place an executive order Trump signed in 2020, and which Biden also overturned, that was aimed at protecting monuments, memorials and statues from destruction and vandalism. Trump had signed the order during the protests over racial injustice that year after police thwarted an attempt by protesters to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, in a park across from the White House. That earlier order had called on the attorney general to fully prosecute any person or group responsible for destroying or vandalizing a monument, memorial or statue. It called for the maximum prosecution of anyone who incited violence and illegal activity and threatened state and local law enforcement agencies with a loss of federal money if they failed to protect monuments. Wednesday's order cites 'Recent examples of conduct necessitating reinstatement of this order' in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel by Hamas and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza, including a demonstration last June when protesters demanding a ceasefire vandalized statues and structures around the White House with graffiti. During his 2024 campaign, Trump had talked about creating a yearlong 'Salute to America 250' celebration. He said that on his first day back in office he would convene a task force that would be responsible for coordinating with state and local governments to plan festivities, beginning this Memorial Day. He said he wanted the plan to include a yearlong 'Great American State Fair' in Iowa, featuring pavilions that would 'showcase the glory of every state in the Union, promote pride in our history, and put forth innovative visions for America’s future.' And he said he wanted to launch 'Patriot Games' — sports contests featuring high school athletes from across the country that he said would 'allow young Americans from every state to show off the best of American skill, sportsmanship and competitive spirit.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-order-to-plan-us-s-250th-anniversary-punish-statue-vandals/7957326.html	2025-01-30T12:17:54-08:00	
Trump's orders take aim at critical race theory, antisemitism on college campuses	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is ordering U.S. schools to stop teaching what he views as 'critical race theory' and other material dealing with race and sexuality or risk losing their federal money. A separate plan announced Wednesday calls for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses, promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be 'Hamas sympathizers.' Both plans were outlined in executive orders signed by Trump on Wednesday. The measures seek to fulfill some of the Republican president's core campaign promises around education, though it's unclear how much power he has to enact the proposals. His order on K-12 schools declares that federal money cannot be used on the 'indoctrination' of children, including 'radical gender ideology and critical race theory.' It says civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex and race would be used to enforce the order, calling critical race theory an 'inherently racist policy.' Examples cited in the order include a policy at Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia requiring teachers to use students' preferred names and pronouns. Another policy at Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin says schools should 'disrupt the gender binary' by teaching students to embrace different gender identities, according to the order. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of civil rights violations and can impose sanctions up to a total loss of federal money, though that penalty has almost never been used and must be approved by a judge. The order unfairly tarnishes teachers and makes it harder for them to do their jobs, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. 'Today is a sad day because the Trump administration is doing exactly what it accuses others of: creating division and fear in classrooms across America,' she said. Trump also directs the education secretary to craft a strategy within 90 days to 'end indoctrination in K-12 education.' Trump has appointed billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon as his education chief, but her Senate confirmation hearing has not been scheduled. During his campaign, Trump said he would sign an order 'on day one' to cut federal money for schools that push critical race theory or other 'inappropriate' content. The federal government provides billions of dollars to schools every year, though the vast majority of their money comes from state and local sources. 'Divisive concepts' The measure taps into a wave of conservative anger that has taken aim at classroom lessons that some see as too liberal. A growing number of Republican states have adopted laws or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory or 'divisive concepts' in public schools and universities. Opponents say the rules impose vague restrictions on teachers and create a chilling effect on discussions about history and other subjects. The term 'critical race theory' refers to a complex academic and legal framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation’s systems. Trey Walk, a researcher and advocate with Human Rights Watch, said students have a right to learn about how discrimination can be entrenched in law and society. 'If the U.S. denies young people this knowledge, it has little hope of eradicating racism,' he said. Trump's plan to fight antisemitism would 'marshal all federal resources' and bring immediate action from the Justice Department to investigate and punish offenders on U.S. campuses. It calls for the deportation of nonresident aliens who 'violate our laws,' citing previous threats by Trump to revoke student visas for international students who attended pro-Palestinian protests. Trump's action promises to 'protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.' It drew swift backlash from civil rights groups who said campus protests have mostly been peaceful and are protected by constitutional free-speech rights. Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the action is discriminatory and wrongly characterizes protesters as 'pro-jihadist' or 'pro-Hamas.' 'These college students were Jewish, Muslim, Black, Palestinian and various other races who were simply protesting what they viewed as a genocide in Gaza,' Mitchell said. 'They are no different than the students who protested Vietnam or segregation or apartheid in South Africa.' Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war led to emotional demonstrations on U.S. campuses, including a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to some 3,200 arrests. The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations into alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and universities after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions. The White House on Wednesday also reinstated an order from Trump's first term establishing the 1776 Commission to promote 'patriotic education' in U.S. schools. Biden revoked the order and the commission's guide for teaching history. The guide played down America’s role in slavery and argued that the civil rights movement ran afoul of the 'lofty ideals' espoused by the Founding Fathers. It was widely panned by historians, who said it was outdated and ignored decades of research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-orders-take-aim-at-critical-race-theory-antisemitism-on-college-campuses/7957336.html	2025-01-30T12:12:42-08:00

Pakistan says Afghan-based 'terrorists' increasingly use US arms for cross-border attacks	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Thursday it had provided Taliban leaders in Afghanistan with 'sufficient proof' to substantiate its claims that militants are using modern weapons left behind by the United States military for cross-border terrorism. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan stated at a weekly news conference in Islamabad that the presence of U.S. advanced weapons in the neighboring country 'remains a source of concern,' and it has been communicated multiple times to the Taliban government in Kabul. 'The proofs are regularly provided,' Khan said when asked for his comments on whether Pakistan has shared any evidence with the Taliban. 'We have given sufficient proof, and this remains an important component of our engagement with the Taliban authorities to convey that the terrorists enjoy sanctuary [in Afghanistan] for attacks inside Pakistan,' the spokesperson asserted. Khan said Islamabad has consistently urged the de facto Afghan leaders to ensure that the weapons 'do not fall into the wrong hands.' Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, vehemently dismissed allegations Thursday that the military hardware in question has been acquired by terrorist organizations and is being utilized in attacks against Pakistani territory. 'All weapons and military equipment are safely stored and maintained to prevent any potential misuse,' Taliban-run state television quoted Fitrat as claiming. Pakistan has seen an increase in militant attacks since the Taliban regained control in Kabul, leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians and security personnel. The violence is primarily attributed to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a globally designated terrorist organization that Islamabad claims is being sheltered and supported by the de facto Afghan rulers. The TTP has been waging deadly attacks for more than 15 years, but regional experts note a marked increase in the precision and lethality of militant raids against Pakistani security forces over the past couple of years, inflicting heavy losses on them. U.S.-led Western troops were stationed in Afghanistan to protect the internationally backed government in Kabul for nearly two decades. They hastily and chaotically withdrew in August 2021, just days after the then-insurgent Taliban regained control of the war-torn South Asian nation. A U.S. Department of Defense report in 2022 found that about $7 billion worth of military hardware was left behind in Afghanistan after the military withdrawal was completed. The equipment, including aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials was subsequently seized by the Taliban. President Donald Trump pledged on the eve of his Jan. 20 inauguration to retrieve the U.S. military weapons from the Taliban, claiming former President Joe Biden’s administration 'gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy.' Trump stated that future financial assistance to Afghanistan would be contingent upon the return of U.S. military equipment. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment,' he said. Taliban officials have not publicly responded to Trump’s assertions but privately claim they fought against and defeated American troops, acquiring the military equipment as 'spoils of the war.' The Kabul government, not recognized by any country, has repeatedly displayed U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past three years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-says-afghan-based-terrorists-increasingly-use-us-arms-for-cross-border-attacks-/7957275.html	2025-01-30T11:48:00-08:00	
Fact-checkers in Ethiopia take on disinformation amid rising tensions	WASHINGTON — As tensions flared between Somalia and Ethiopia last year, social media became a breeding ground for misinformation. One video falsely claiming to show Egyptian troops training in Somalia gained 34,000 views on the social media platform X. But fact-checkers were able to prove the footage was old and unrelated to the current tensions. The case was not an isolated incident in Ethiopia, or globally. The spread of mis- or disinformation is a global phenomenon. Research has repeatedly shown how hostile groups use disinformation to further inflame tensions, create confusion and weaken trust in institutions, including government offices, nonprofits and media. Often it falls to news outlets or fact-checking initiatives to set the record straight. But moves by Meta to end some fact-checking tools such as CrowdTangle, and its decision in January to end a Facebook fact-check program in the U.S., have experts concerned about how to contain the spread of hate speech and disinformation. In Ethiopia, some specialists are already seeking extra training to be able to better spot and debunk false or misleading content. Communications specialist Netsanet Tesfaye already knew how to use tools such as Google’s reverse image search. But he sought extra training after seeing how quickly doctored images can be spread to stoke tensions. To learn how to better spot fakes, Netsanet turned to HaqCheck, an Ethiopia-based organization set up four years ago. 'Fake information is causing great damage to organizations and the country. The methods people use have also gone from spreading simple rumors to using advanced technology such as deep fake or AI. So it was important I understand what tools are available to counter them,' Netsanet said. Since its launch, HaqCheck has identified and debunked thousands of misleading posts shared on social media and has made it easier for the public to verify information, said Kirubel Tesfaye, lead fact-checker at HaqCheck. It also offers training. 'It wasn't until I joined HaqCheck that I began to understand the darker side of social media,' Kirubel said. 'I'm constantly shocked by the lengths people will go to to disseminate false information.' Much of the misinformation Kirubel and his team deal with involves internal conflicts, border disputes, and the diplomatic tension between Ethiopia and Somalia over a port deal with Somaliland. 'We also find the prime minister's and government officials' various speeches are frequently manipulated,' Kirubel said. Dangers of disinformation Most of the disinformation is circulated on social media. Facebook, TikTok and the Telegram messaging apps are all popular in Ethiopia. But some platforms have been criticized for posts that stoke tensions. A 2023 Amnesty International report alleges that Meta, Facebook's parent company, contributed to human rights abuses against the Tigrayan community in Ethiopia. The report said Facebook’s algorithms 'supercharged the spread of harmful rhetoric' and that content moderation systems failed to prevent that spread. Noting that Facebook is widely used in Ethiopia and 'considered a trustworthy news source,' Amnesty said that its 'algorithms fueled devastating human rights impacts' on Tigrayans. Prior to the conflict in Tigray, Facebook in November 2021 announced that Ethiopia was in its highest-risk category for violence, and that it had developed technology to identify hate speech in Ethiopia's four most spoken languages. The following year, two British digital research companies found that Facebook was still approving posts containing hate speech during the conflict. The U.N.’s then-special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, noted similar findings in her 2022 reports. Meta does have systems in place to try to address such concerns. But in the U.S., some of those methods are being rolled back. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced a change in policy to end content moderation — its third-party fact-checking program — in the U.S. 'The fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the U.S.,' Zuckerberg said in a January 7 video. 'So, over the next couple of months, we are going to phase in a more comprehensive community notes system.' In his message, Zuckerberg said the platform, which globally has 2.9 billion monthly users, plans to change its content policies. Zuckerberg in August said the Biden administration had 'pressured' his company to censor posts about the coronavirus pandemic. Misinformation alerts were added to Facebook and Instagram posts that contained disinformation about the pandemic or vaccines. And some posts critical of the vaccines were deleted. Contacted by VOA’s Horn of Africa Service, Meta said it was making changes in the U.S. first and would improve its systems 'before expansion to other countries.' 'There are no changes in other countries at this time, and before rolling out any changes to our fact-checking program outside of the U.S., we will carefully consider our obligations,' Meta said. Fact-checker tool kit Back in Ethiopia, HaqCheck fact-checkers rely on several digital tools to verify information, including reverse image search. CrowdTangle was one such tool, helping the team analyze public content on social media. Meta shut down the tool in August, saying it didn't provide a complete picture of what was happening on its platform. 'It was a powerful tool that helped us monitor Facebook, Instagram and Reddit,' said Kirubel of HaqCheck. 'Now we've reverted to manual monitoring, using keywords.' The team employs other tools, too, including InVid, which can help researchers identify when an image was first shared, and whether or even where it was manipulated. Beyond debunking false information, the group trains journalists, communication experts and academics. Netsanet said that this work carries special significance in countries like Ethiopia. 'False information can turn ethnic groups that lived in harmony against each other and threaten national security,' he said. 'The spread of misinformation also worsens conflicts. So, fact-checking means protecting a country from all that.' To ensure it reaches as wide an audience as possible, HaqCheck publishes verified articles on its website, social media and local TV stations.

Trump's FBI chief pick, Kash Patel, says bureau has lost trust which he will restore	Washington — Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the FBI, portrayed himself Thursday as the right leader of a law enforcement agency he said had lost public trust and told senators he would commit himself to 'due process and transparency' if confirmed as director. At his confirmation hearing, Patel braced for deeply skeptical questioning from Senate Democrats about his loyalty to the president and stated desire to overhaul the bureau. He is a Trump loyalist who, before being nominated to lead the FBI, railed against the bureau over its investigations into the president and said that Jan. 6 rioters were mistreated by the Justice Department. Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI is critical in keeping America safe from terrorism, violent crime and other threats, and the nation 'needs an FBI director who understands the gravity of this mission and is ready on day one, not someone who is consumed by his own personal political grievances.' Patel was picked in November to replace Christopher Wray, who led the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency for more than seven years but was forced out of the job Trump had appointed him to after being seen as insufficiently loyal to him. A former aide to the House Intelligence Committee and an ex-federal prosecutor who served in Trump's first administration, Patel has alarmed critics with rhetoric — in dozens of podcasts and books he has authored — in which he has demonstrated fealty to Trump and assailed the decision-making of the agency he's now been asked to lead. He's also identified by name officials he believes should be investigated. In one such podcast interview last year, he said that if he oversaw the FBI, he would 'shut down' the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington and 'reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state.’' 'And I’d take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to go chase down criminals. Go be cops,' he added. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published Wednesday night, Patel did not address some of his more incendiary comments or criticism of the FBI, except to say that his time as a House staffer investigating flaws in the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation had shown him how 'the FBI’s immense powers can be abused.' 'I spearheaded the investigation that found the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — a tool I had previously used to hunt down terrorists — had been unlawfully used to spy on political opponents,' he wrote. 'Such misconduct is unacceptable and undermines public trust.' Patel pledged to be transparent if confirmed as director and said he would keep the FBI out of prosecutorial decisions, keeping them instead with Justice Department lawyers. 'First, let good cops be cops,' Patel wrote in outlining his priorities. 'Leadership means supporting agents in their mission to apprehend criminals and protect our citizens. If confirmed, I will focus on streamlining operations at headquarters while bolstering the presence of field agents across the nation. Collaboration with local law enforcement is crucial to fulfilling the FBI’s mission.' Patel found common cause with Trump over their shared skepticism of government surveillance and the 'deep state' — a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy. He was part of a small group of supporters during Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York who accompanied him to the courthouse, where he told reporters that Trump was the victim of an 'unconstitutional circus.' That close bond would depart from the modern-day precedent of FBI directors looking to keep presidents at arm’s length. Several Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee who have met with Patel, including Durbin of Illinois, have issued statements sounding the alarm and signaling their opposition to the pick. The lawmakers foreshadowed their interest in Patel by directing numerous questions about him to Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general, when she had her own confirmation hearing this month. Republican allies of Trump, who share the president's belief that the FBI has become politicized, have rallied around Patel and pledged to support him, seeing him as someone who can shake up the bureau and provide needed change. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the committee, sought to blunt attacks on Patel preemptively by focusing on the need to reform an FBI that he said had become weaponized. The FBI in recent years has become entangled in numerous politically explosive investigations, including not just the two federal inquiries into Trump that resulted in indictments but also probes of President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. 'It’s no surprise that public trust has declined in an institution that has been plagued by abuse, a lack of transparency, and the weaponization of law enforcement,' Grassley said. 'Nevertheless, the FBI remains an important, even indispensable institution for law and order in our country.' He later added: 'Mr. Patel, should you be confirmed, you will take charge of an FBI that is in crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-fbi-chief-pick-kash-patel-says-bureau-has-lost-trust-which-he-will-restore/7957029.html	2025-01-30T09:01:01-08:00	
South African, Rwandan leaders in war of words over DR Congo	Johannesburg — Rwandan President Paul Kagame has lashed out at South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa, after Ramaphosa accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels behind the escalating crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo this week. Kagame has accused Ramaphosa of 'lying' and warned of possible 'confrontation.' South Africa has troops deployed in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo as part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission there, as well as in a separate deployment by the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, aimed at backing up Congolese forces fighting rebels. But Pretoria is under pressure this week after 13 South African soldiers were killed in a recent surge in fighting that resulted in the M23 militia – which Rwanda is widely accused of backing – making a rapid advance and seizing partial control of the key city of Goma in North Kivu province on Sunday night. Ramaphosa said in a written statement on Wednesday that the M23, and what he called 'a Rwandan Defense Force militia,' were responsible for the casualties, while his minister of defense, Angie Motshekga, went one step further. 'It’s just that at that stage, when they were firing above our heads, the president did warn them to say, ‘If you are going to fire, we’ll take it as a declaration of war.’' The remarks by Ramaphosa and Motshekga have caused a diplomatic spat with Kigali. Kagame verbally hit back in an angry statement posted to his social media on Wednesday night, saying the Rwandan Defense Force was not a militia and quote, 'if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.' He also disputed Ramaphosa’s statement that the dead South African soldiers were 'peacekeepers,' saying the SADC force was engaged in 'offensive combat operations.' 'I spoke with the president of South Africa, who sought me out to speak with me, on this matter, because of their involvement in eastern Congo, and he’s also there pretending to be playing a peacemaker role. M23 are not Rwandans, please, and South Africa dares even issue threats,' he said. South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola has directly blamed Rwanda for backing the M23, saying reports by U.N. experts proved Kigali’s involvement. He said on Wednesday that South Africa had taken part in an African Union meeting on the crisis. 'As South Africa, we participated in that platform and put our position across, which is that there is a ceasefire, immediate cessation of hostilities… and, also, to request all the forces that are supporting M23, to also cease all support immediately,' he said. Mineral-rich eastern Congo, which borders Rwanda, has been plagued by conflict for more than three decades. The current fighting stems partly from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The perpetrators fled across the border to North Kivu, and Rwanda says they now represent a security threat to its territory. The Congolese government has accused Kigali of being active in eastern Congo, saying Kigali is after the area’s vast mineral wealth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-rwandan-leaders-in-war-of-words-over-dr-congo/7957006.html	2025-01-30T08:49:25-08:00	
UN mission in DR Congo under scrutiny as conflict escalates	NAIROBI, KENYA — Seventeen U.N. peacekeepers have been killed this year in clashes between M23 rebels and government forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including three within the last week, the U.N. reported Wednesday. The three peacekeepers — one from Uruguay and two from South Africa — were killed over the weekend in the fighting around Goma. More than 300 U.N. peacekeepers have been killed since the mission in Congo was deployed in 1999. The deaths have renewed questions about the future of the U.N. mission, known as MONUSCO. The Congolese government requested the mission’s withdrawal last year, citing its failure to prevent attacks by the many armed groups in eastern Congo. Philippe Undji, a member of parliament from South Kivu province and a member of the AFDC party, which is allied with President Felix Tshisekedi's ruling party, said the government is waiting to see how the United Nations handles this latest conflict. 'I think the U.N. peacekeepers have helped to protect the civilians, but it's not enough,' Undji said. 'We are watching the United Nations meeting in the U.S. over this matter, and the decision they are going to make will tell us whether they like Africa and DR Congo. We are telling them we are watching their next move.' Undji said he wants to see action taken against Rwanda, which Congo, the U.N. secretary-general and other observers accuse of supporting M23. Kigali denies the allegation. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said the conflict is a Congolese internal problem and has accused Kinshasa of supporting rebel groups that want to interfere with his country's security. International relations and diplomacy expert Kizito Sabala said the violence and tension will increase pressure on the U.N. mission to withdraw. 'I think the calls for its withdrawal will intensify, and it's going to convince everyone that MONUSCO’s time in DRC is long overdue,' Sabala said. 'They need to leave.' Addressing the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, Vivian van de Perre, the deputy special representative for protection and operations in MONUSCO, said the mission remains important in addressing the conflict and humanitarian situation. 'Despite the significant challenges, MONUSCO continues to play a vital role in this crisis in eastern DRC and has proven to be a beacon for myriad vulnerable groups seeking protection,' van de Perre said. 'However, the mission is challenged in ensuring safety of its staff and premises, which has been severely impacted heavily by direct and indirect fire used in these last few days, and to address the logistical, human rights and humanitarian challenges we are all facing to ensure the mission's continued effectiveness,' she said. The peacekeepers are mandated to protect civilians and humanitarian workers and support the Congolese government's stabilization and peace efforts. Sabala said, 'We always see there is a conflict going on, and I think they owe the international community and the region an explanation for why this is happening. Is it about their mandate, their facilities, or the equipment? Because I think that explanation will help the region and the international community see how best to address the problem in DRC.' Experts warn that M23’s capture of Goma could start another extended period of instability and, in the worst scenario, a third Congo war. The previous conflicts, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, caused widespread destruction, displacement and food shortages, leading to the deaths of several million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-mission-in-drc-under-scrutiny-as-conflict-escalates/7956989.html	2025-01-30T08:44:23-08:00	
Economic hardship affects Lunar New Year celebrations in China	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The Lunar New Year, also called the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival in China, is traditionally celebrated with tables piled with food and red envelopes filled with cash for children. In past years, smoke from outdoor fire pits filled the air throughout the morning and afternoon, as people burned paper money to ensure that even the ancestors can feel the financial boon that the biggest holiday of the year usually brings to the living. In recent years, however, China’s economic slowdown has altered the atmosphere of Chinese New Year. Facing increasing financial burdens, young people are reexamining long-held traditions as they welcome the Year of the Snake, opting for more frugal alternatives during this year’s eight-day-long national holiday. A 30-year-old legal worker from Shanghai, who did not want to use his name for fear of reprisal, told VOA that stores selling trinkets and supplies for the holiday appeared unusually deserted. He said people appear to be forgoing large purchases, which manifests mostly in the custom of giving money-filled red envelopes — the color symbolizes good luck and prosperity in the new year. 'As with goods purchased for the new year, red envelopes have become more simple and less thick,' the Shanghai resident said. He told VOA he usually gives his niece an envelope with around $140 inside, but this year, he plans to give her $90. Talk on social media Frustration with the economy is being expressed on social media — young people are saturating online threads with images and comments describing the pressure and criticism they will encounter during the holiday. An account on RedNote called 'I don’t give a damn about the banana' posted a series of funny images detailing the levels of anxiety young, unmarried and unemployed people will face during the holiday. 'You haven’t earned any money but you still have to give the younger kids a red envelope,' the user wrote, over a picture of a woman giving a small bill to a cat. Many others offer advice to ease fears of being scrutinized by the family. 'Unique-me' wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo: 'Now the economy is not good, it's good to just have an income. If you are in a difficult situation, you can admit that you don't make much. There is no need to be generous. Just show your appreciation. Those who have opinions about you because of the size of your red envelope, let them have opinions.' Faced with economic woes, some local governments are advocating frugality. Baise City, Guangxi, suggested that the amount of money in a red envelope should not exceed $3. The initiative also encourages the younger generation to give their elders 'blessing gifts' with commemorative significance or emotional value instead of red envelopes. This move has attracted widespread attention, with many social media users expressing their support for the program’s positive impact on financial and mental health. Some suggested that blessing gifting be promoted nationwide. Workplace anxiety The size of red envelopes exchanged in the workplace and increasing leniency on new year vacation day allowances have stoked fears of job insecurity among employees. 'The economic downturn is not only reflected in my meager salary, but also in the red envelopes given by the boss every year,' 'Life with Greed' said on Weibo. A user called 'Let’s try to be happy' commented on Weibo: 'My company is in a slump. New Year gifts have not been issued. In previous years, the maximum New Year holiday was 20 days, but this year it was more than a month. I don't know what it will be like next year. It feels like it is on the verge of bankruptcy.' A 39-year-old government worker in Dalian, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity because of security fears, said despite having a family and a stable job, she will limit her holiday spending. 'We have to reduce some unnecessary expenses, such as buying less candy and snacks, and we try to buy simple things outside when worshiping,' the wife and mother said. The changes in Chinese Spring Festival customs are affected by many factors, but the economy is most critical, said Sun Guoxiang, a professor in the international affairs and business department at Nanhua University in Taiwan. 'The economic downturn has led to a decline in consumption capacity. Young people pay more attention to rational consumption and actual needs, which reduces the relatively high-cost parts of traditional Spring Festival customs,' Sun said, adding that pressure from family about issues that include work, marriage and education cannot be ignored as drivers of this trend. He said the future of Chinese New Year and how it will be celebrated will depend heavily on China’s development and whether the country can overcome its current economic decline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/economic-hardship-affects-lunar-new-year-celebrations-in-china/7956877.html	2025-01-30T07:04:32-08:00

Uganda confirms Ebola outbreak in capital Kampala, one dead	Kampala, Uganda — Uganda has confirmed an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the capital Kampala, with the first confirmed patient dying from the disease on Wednesday, the health ministry said on Thursday. The patient, a nurse at the Mulago referral hospital in the capital, had initially sought treatment at various facilities, including Mulago after developing fever-like symptoms. 'The patient experienced multi-organ failure and succumbed to the illness at Mulago National Referral Hospital on Jan 29. Post-mortem samples confirmed Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (strain),' the ministry said. The highly infectious hemorrhagic fever is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissue. Symptoms include headache, vomiting blood, muscle pains and bleeding. Uganda last suffered an outbreak in late 2022 and that outbreak was declared over on Jan. 11, 2023, after nearly four months in which it struggled to contain the viral infection. The last outbreak killed 55 of the 143 people infected and the dead included six health workers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-confirms-ebola-outbreak-in-capital-kampala-one-dead/7956782.html	2025-01-30T05:35:32-08:00

Philippine president offers deal to China: Stop sea aggression and I'll return missiles to US	MANILA — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. offered on Thursday to remove a U.S. missile system from the Philippines if China halts what he called its 'aggressive and coercive behavior' in the disputed South China Sea. The U.S. Army installed the Typhon mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines in April last year to support what the longtime treaty allies described as training for joint combat readiness. China has repeatedly demanded that the Philippines remove the missile system, saying it was 'inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race.' Asked by reporters about China's criticism of the missile system, Marcos said he did not understand the Chinese position because the Philippines does not comment on China's missile systems which 'are a thousand times more powerful than what we have.' 'Let's make a deal with China: Stop claiming our territory, stop harassing our fishermen and let them have a living, stop ramming our boats, stop water cannoning our people, stop firing lasers at us and stop your aggressive and coercive behavior, and we'll return the typhoon missiles,' Marcos told reporters in central Cebu province. 'Let them stop everything they're doing and I'll return all of those,' he said. Chinese officials did not immediately comment on the Philippine leader's remarks. The U.S. Army's mobile Typhon missile system, which consists of a launcher and at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles, was repositioned about two weeks ago from the northern Philippines to a strategic area nearer the capital, Manila, in consultation with Philippine defense officials, a senior Philippine official told The Associated Press. The Philippine official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue in public, said the U.S. missile system is now nearer an area where Chinese and Philippine coast guard and navy forces have been involved in increasingly tense faceoffs in the South China Sea. Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which puts parts of mainland China within their range. The missile system will remain in the Philippines indefinitely, the Philippine official said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said last week that the Philippines is 'creating tensions and antagonism in the region and inciting geopolitical confrontation and an arms race' by allowing the U.S. missile system to be positioned in its territory. 'This is a highly dangerous move and an extremely irresponsible choice,' Mao said. Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro has rejected China's demand that the missile system be removed as interference in Philippine internal affairs. The U.S. and the Philippines have repeatedly condemned China's increasingly assertive actions to press its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where hostilities have flared over the past two years with repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine coast guard forces and accompanying vessels. Aside from China and the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the busy waterway, a key shipping route which is also believed to be sitting atop large undersea deposits of gas and oil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-president-offers-deal-to-china-stop-sea-aggression-and-i-ll-return-missiles-to-us/7956717.html	2025-01-30T04:31:44-08:00	
EU vows 'action plan' for beleaguered auto sector	Brussels, Belgium — The EU promised Thursday an 'action plan' to help the bloc's beleaguered auto sector, as it held talks with industry leaders who have sounded the alarm over emissions fines and Chinese competition. The European Union is under pressure to help a sector that employs 13 million people and accounts for about seven percent of the bloc's GDP, as it seeks to revamp the continent's lagging competitiveness. 'The European automotive industry is at a pivotal moment, and we acknowledge the challenges it faces. That is why we are acting swiftly to address them,' EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said, promising an 'action plan' by early March. Chaired by the European Commission president, the so-called 'strategic dialogue' brought together carmakers, suppliers, civil society groups and trade unions. Representatives of 22 industry 'players' including Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes and Renault, were in attendance, the commission said. The get-together comes as the commission embarks on a pro-business shift, with firms complaining its focus on climate and business ethics has resulted in excessive regulations. On Wednesday, it unveiled a blueprint to revamp the bloc's economic model, amid worries that low productivity, high energy prices, weak investments and other ills are leaving the EU behind the United States and China. The car industry has been plunged into crisis by high manufacturing costs, a stuttering switch to electric vehicles (EV) and increased competition from China. Announcements of possible job cuts have multiplied. Volkswagen plans to axe 35,000 positions across its German locations by 2030. Emissions fines Carmakers have been calling for 'flexibility' on the steep emission fines they could face in 2025 -- something the bloc's new growth blueprint said should be in the cards. 'Penalizing immediately the industry, financially, is not a good idea, because the industry is in trouble and... has to restructure itself, which will cost a lot of money,' Patrick Koller, CEO of French parts producer Forvia, said ahead of the meeting. 'When you look back, we have heavy industries which disappeared from Europe completely, because of lack of competitiveness.' To combat climate change, the EU introduced a set of emission-reduction targets that should lead to the sale of fossil-fuel-burning cars, being phased out by 2035. About 16 percent of the planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) gas released into the atmosphere in Europe comes from cars' exhaust pipes, the EU says. As of this year, carmakers have to lower the average CO2 emitted by all newly sold vehicles by 15 percent from 2021 levels, or pay a penalty -- with tougher cuts further down the road, according to advocacy group Transport & Environment. The idea is to incentivize firms to increase the share of EVs, hybrids and small vehicles they sell compared to, for instance, diesel-guzzling SUVs. But some manufacturers complain that is proving harder than expected as consumers have yet to warm to EVs, which have higher upfront costs and lack an established used-vehicle market. 'We want to stick to the objective... but we can smoothen the way,' von der Leyen said on Wednesday. Critics say lifting the fines would unfairly penalize producers who have invested to comply and remove a key incentive to speed up electric transitions. Sales and tariffs EV sales slid 1.3 percent in Europe last year, accounting for 13.6 percent of all sales, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), an industry group. A senior EU official said incentives for businesses to buy electric are an option. 'Company fleets' account for more than half of new cars purchased in Europe, the official said. The 27-nation bloc could also seek to improve a patchy charging network, modernize grids to allow for faster charging, bring down energy costs, cut regulations and loosen China's grip on battery production, analysts say. Meanwhile, the market share of Chinese electric cars has ballooned in the EU, to reach 14 percent in the second quarter of 2024. Brussels has imposed extra import tariffs on China-made electric vehicles of up to 35.3 percent after concluding Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. The move was opposed by Germany and other EU members, and it is the object of a lawsuit by BMW, Tesla and several Chinese automakers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-vows-action-plan-for-beleaguered-auto-sector-/7956667.html	2025-01-30T04:07:01-08:00	
Rwanda's Kagame slams criticism of east Congo offensive as rebels push south	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — President Paul Kagame said Rwanda was ready for 'confrontation' as he rejected criticism over his backing for M23 rebels who were pushing south on Thursday in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after capturing the major city of Goma. M23 rebels, with support from Rwandan troops, marched into Goma this week and are now advancing toward Bukavu, capital of neighboring South Kivu province, in the biggest escalation since 2012 of a decades-old conflict. Rwanda is facing an international backlash over its actions in eastern Congo, where it has repeatedly intervened either directly or through allied militias over the past 30 years in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. But the chorus of condemnation, which has included Germany canceling aid talks with Rwanda and Britain threatening to withhold $40 million of annual bilateral assistance, was having no apparent effect on the ground. After seizing Goma, a lakeside city of nearly 2 million and a major hub for displaced people and aid groups, M23 fighters were advancing south from the town of Minova, along the western side of Lake Kivu. They tried to take the town of Nyabibwe, about 50 km north of Bukavu, on Wednesday but were pushed back by Congolese forces, a local resident told Reuters by phone. A civil society source in Bukavu, who has contacts around the region, said clashes were ongoing on Thursday morning in a location known as Kahalala, about 20 km away from Nyabibwe. 'The Congolese army seems to be putting up fierce resistance there,' the source said. In the latest diplomatic initiative, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot arrived on Thursday in Congo's capital Kinshasa, more than 1,600 km west of Goma. He was due to meet President Felix Tshisekedi, the Congolese presidency said. Barrot's visit comes two days after Congolese protesters in Kinshasa attacked the French embassy and several other foreign missions over their perceived support for Rwanda. Any successful push south by M23 would see them control territory previous rebellions have not taken since the end of two major wars that ran from 1996 to 2003, and magnify the risk of an all-out conflict that draws in regional countries. Troops from neighboring Burundi, which has had hostile relations with Rwanda, support Congolese troops in South Kivu. A spokesperson for Burundi's military declined to comment on the current situation in Congo. In Goma itself, where M23 say they plan to administer the city and appear to be settling in for a lengthy period of control, the border with Rwanda, which is close to the city center, was re-opened under M23 control, its spokesperson said. Kagame accuses South Africa Kagame responded angrily on X to a post by President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, 13 of whose soldiers have been killed in eastern Congo since last week. Ramaphosa attributed the fighting to an escalation by the M23 and the Rwandan army. Kagame accused South African forces of working alongside a militia in Congo with ties to perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide and 'threatening to take the war to Rwanda itself.' 'If South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator,' Kagame wrote. 'And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.' Since the fall of Goma, Rwanda has also reacted angrily to calls for restraint from Western nations, accusing its critics of 'victim-blaming' and turning a blind eye to what it says is Congo's complicity in the slaughter of Tutsis. Congo rejects Rwanda's accusations, saying Kigali's true motive for involvement in its eastern provinces is to use its proxy militias to control lucrative mineral mines. U.N. experts have documented the export of large quantities of looted Congolese minerals via Rwanda. M23 is the latest ethnic Tutsi-led insurgency backed by Rwanda to fight in Congo since the 1994 genocide, when extremist Hutus killed about a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and were then toppled by Tutsi forces led by Kagame, who has been Rwanda's president ever since. About a million Hutus, some refugees and some genocide perpetrators, fled into eastern Congo in the aftermath of the genocide, and Rwanda accuses Congo of harboring Hutu-led militias bent on killing Tutsis and threatening Rwanda itself. The eight-member East African Community, to which Rwanda and Congo both belong, held a virtual summit late on Wednesday to discuss the crisis. The final communique largely embraced Rwanda's position. It called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict through direct talks between Congo and armed groups. Congo rejects direct negotiations with the M23, which it considers a terrorist group. The EAC also recommended a joint summit to discuss the crisis with the Southern African Development Community. SADC member Angola, which has led the most recent efforts to broker a peace deal but is also a firm ally of Congo, called on Rwanda to withdraw its forces shortly after hosting Tshisekedi for talks in Luanda on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-s-kagame-slams-criticism-of-east-congo-offensive-as-rebels-push-south/7956645.html	2025-01-30T03:31:19-08:00	
UN rights chief seeks $500 million in 2025, warning that lives are at risk	GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief appealed on Thursday for $500 million in funding for 2025 to support its work, such as investigating human rights abuses around the world from Syria to Sudan, warning that lives hang in the balance. The U.N. human rights office has been grappling with chronic funding shortages that some worry could be exacerbated by cuts to U.S. foreign aid by President Donald Trump. The annual appeal is for funds beyond the allocated U.N. funds from member states' fees, which make up just a fraction of the office's needs. 'In 2025, we expect no let-up in major challenges to human rights,' High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told member states in a speech at the U.N. in Geneva. 'I am very concerned that if we do not reach our funding targets in 2025, we will leave people ... to struggle and possibly fail, without adequate support,' he said. He said any shortfall would mean more people remain in illegal detention; that governments are allowed to continue with discriminatory policies; violations may go undocumented; and human rights defenders could lose protection. 'In short, lives are at stake,' Turk said. The human rights office gets about 5% of the regular U.N. budget, but the majority of its funding comes voluntarily in response to its annual appeal announced on Thursday. Western states give the most, with the United States donating $35 million last year or about 15% of the total received in 2024, followed by the European Commission, U.N. data showed. Still, the office received only about half of the $500 million it sought last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-rights-chief-seeks-500-million-in-2025-warning-that-lives-are-at-risk/7956627.html	2025-01-30T03:03:16-08:00	
Senate panel to question director of national intelligence nominee Gabbard	The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee is set to question former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as she seeks confirmation to become the nation’s director of national intelligence. Gabbard is expected to face questions about her 2017 visit to Syria, when during her time in Congress she met with then-President Bashar al-Assad. At the time she faced criticism for what opponents of the trip said was legitimizing Assad amid the Syrian civil war. The military veteran, who ran for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 presidential election, was a critic of the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine, including questioning sending aid for Ukrainian troops instead of using resources for domestic issues. 'This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns,' Gabbard said as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In announcing her nomination, U.S. President Donald Trump said Gabbard would 'bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and security Peace through Strength.' If approved by a simple majority in the Senate, Gabbard would oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump’s Republican Party holds a 53-47 Senate majority. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7956608.html	2025-01-30T02:38:04-08:00	
NATO, EU on high alert as undersea cable attacks escalate in Baltic	As authorities investigate the fourth Baltic Sea cable-cutting incident in recent months, European leaders have expressed concern about the frequency of attacks involving civilian vessels and critical civilian infrastructure. The Vezhen, a Bulgarian-owned vessel, was detained this week in the Baltic Sea, suspected of dragging its anchor across the seafloor, severing a data cable between Sweden and Latvia. Aleksander Kalchev, the CEO of the company that owns the Vezhen, denied that the damage was intentional. Nevertheless, Swedish security services have boarded the vessel for further investigation. Latvian Minister of Defense Andris Spruds, in a written response to VOA on Wednesday, confirmed that Latvia is working closely with Sweden and NATO to address the incident. 'Latvia’s Naval Forces' diving team has conducted an inspection at the damage site and collected evidence in cooperation with Swedish Coast Guard vessels,' Spruds told VOA. He emphasized that Latvia would deploy new technologies and continue working closely with NATO allies to enhance the protection of critical sea infrastructure. 'These sabotage actions will not be tolerated, and we will continue to enforce bold actions within the rule of law,' Spruds said. Growing pattern of attacks Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, whose country launched a sabotage investigation into damage to the Estlink 2 undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25, has emphasized the urgency of the situation. 'This cannot continue,' he told Finnish Lannen Media this week. He called for stronger coordination within the European Union to prevent further attacks. 'We must be on a common front in sanctions against Russia. That applies to every EU country,' he told a Finnish journalist. The government in Poland, another Baltic Sea country with more than 1,000 kilometers of coastline, has called for enhanced security measures. In an interview with VOA, Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said recent attacks on undersea cables — such as those between Latvia and Sweden, as well as Estonia and Finland — align with broader patterns of sabotage seen in the region. While investigations are ongoing, Poland views these incidents as deliberate actions, he said. 'Even if there is no direct evidence today, sabotage and provocations are part of Russia’s standard arsenal. ... We are at a point where we have to assume that this is a conscious, deliberate action,' he told VOA on Tuesday. Polish officials also emphasize the need for more coordinated maritime security measures. 'We want such policing missions to start taking place in the Baltic Sea. There is a lot of traffic when it comes to ships and vessels … and security is an absolutely fundamental issue here,' he told VOA. Given its strategic importance and the increasing presence of Russian naval activity, he said, NATO must prioritize the Baltic Sea as a critical security zone. 'The Baltic Sea has become an arena where all tricks are allowed,' Siemoniak said. Political and strategic motives While evidence is still being gathered, the geopolitical implications of these attacks are becoming clearer. Analysts believe the sabotage is not just an attempt to disrupt communication networks but also a calculated effort to test NATO’s response capabilities and sow discord among member states. Lawmakers in Finland, the newest member of NATO, have voiced concerns that these incidents may be part of a broader conflict that many Western governments are hesitant to acknowledge. 'If we don't know whether we're at war, it's always best to assume that we are,' Jussi Halla-aho, the speaker of the Finnish Parliament, said in an interview earlier this month in the Turku daily Turun Sanomat. Countering hybrid warfare A significant challenge for NATO and its allies is how to respond effectively to these incidents. Unlike conventional military aggression, these acts of sabotage involve civilian vessels and infrastructure, making direct retaliation difficult. 'If we openly accuse Russia or China of these attacks, the next logical question is: What are we going to do about it?' Matti Posio, a Finnish foreign policy expert and chief editor at Lannen Media Oy, told VOA in an interview. 'The reality is that options are limited, and that’s exactly what the perpetrators are counting on.' With tensions rising, NATO is considering additional measures to secure the Baltic Sea, officials and observers told VOA. One option includes increasing naval patrols and surveillance of key maritime routes. However, 'more drastic proposals — such as closing parts of the Gulf of Finland to Russian-linked vessels — remain politically sensitive and legally complex,' Posio said. Dilemma for NATO and EU Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen, who visited Latvia this week, issued a a statement with her Latvian counterpart. 'We are aware that Russia is a long-term threat to world peace and international order; therefore, NATO’s deterrence and defense measures must be further strengthened, while coordinating the Allied response to the intensifying threat posed by Russia,' their statement said. As tensions rise, NATO has launched Baltic Sentry 2025 to enhance security and resilience. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has emphasized the need for greater coordination in protecting critical infrastructure from sabotage. EU interior ministers will meet in Warsaw on Thursday. Among other topics, they will address growing concerns over sabotage targeting critical infrastructure in Europe. The ministers are expected to discuss potential countermeasures and coordination efforts to strengthen security and deterrence against future disruptions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-eu-on-high-alert-as-undersea-cable-attacks-escalate-in-baltic/7956600.html	2025-01-30T02:26:58-08:00	
Russian drone attack kills 4 in Sumy, Ukraine says	Ukrainian officials said Thursday a Russian drone attack killed at least four people in the northeastern city of Sumy. The regional state administration in Sumy said a drone hit a high-rise residential building, and that the attack also injured nine people. Ukraine’s military said it shot down 37 of the 81 drones that Russian forces launched overnight. Intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Poltava, Odesa, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged two residential buildings, a grain warehouse and a hospital. Officials in Zhytomyr said drone fragments damaged six houses. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight in Belgorod and another two drones in Bryansk. US aid Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday he has received an initial report on 'critical programs' previously funded by American support that are now suspended. U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended funding of many foreign programs to conduct a 90-day audit of foreign aid. Zelenskyy said the key areas that have been affected by the frozen funds are the energy sector, veteran projects and border crossings. Ukrainian officials have been instructed to continue their own audit of areas affected by the frozen funds, Zelenskyy said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-kills-4-in-sumy-ukraine-says/7956543.html	2025-01-30T00:37:24-08:00	
Microsoft, Meta CEOs defend hefty AI spending after DeepSeek stuns tech world	Days after Chinese upstart DeepSeek revealed a breakthrough in cheap AI computing that shook the U.S. technology industry, the chief executives of Microsoft and Meta defended massive spending that they said was key to staying competitive in the new field. DeepSeek's quick progress has stirred doubts about the lead America has in AI with models that it claims can match or even outperform Western rivals at a fraction of the cost, but the U.S. executives said on Wednesday that building huge computer networks was necessary to serve growing corporate needs. 'Investing 'very heavily' in capital expenditure and infrastructure is going to be a strategic advantage over time,' Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a post-earnings call. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, said the spending was needed to overcome the capacity constraints that have hampered the technology giant's ability to capitalize on AI. 'As AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand,' he said on a call with analysts. Microsoft has earmarked $80 billion for AI in its current fiscal year, while Meta has pledged as much as $65 billion towards the technology. That is a far cry from the roughly $6 million DeepSeek said it has spent to develop its AI model. U.S. tech executives and Wall Street analysts say that reflects the amount spent on computing power, rather than all development costs. Still, some investors seem to be losing patience with the hefty spending and lack of big payoffs. Shares of Microsoft — widely seen as a front runner in the AI race because of its tie to industry leader OpenAI - were down 5% in extended trading after the company said that growth in its Azure cloud business in the current quarter would fall short of estimates. 'We really want to start to see a clear road map to what that monetization model looks like for all of the capital that's been invested,' said Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which holds shares in Microsoft. Meta, meanwhile, sent mixed signals about how its bets on AI-powered tools were paying off, with a strong fourth quarter but a lackluster sales forecast for the current period. 'With these huge expenses, they need to turn the spigot on in terms of revenue generated, but I think this week was a wake-up call for the U.S.' said Futurum Group analyst Daniel Newman. 'For AI right now, there's too much capital expenditure, not enough consumption.' There are some signs though that executives are moving to change that. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said the company's capital spending in the current quarter and the next would remain around the $22.6 billion level seen in the second quarter. 'In fiscal 2026, we expect to continue to invest against strong demand signals. However, the growth rate will be lower than fiscal 2025 (which ends in June),' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/microsoft-meta-ceos-defend-hefty-ai-spending-after-deepseek-stuns-tech-world/7956542.html	2025-01-30T00:26:38-08:00

Israel, Hamas to carry out third exchange of hostages, prisoners under ceasefire	Israel and Hamas are set to carry out their third exchange of hostages and prisoners on Thursday as part of a ceasefire agreement that has halted fighting in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is due to release three Israelis and five Thai citizens. Israel is releasing 110 Palestinian prisoners. Previous exchanges have freed seven hostages the militants were holding in Gaza and 300 prisoners held by Israel. Hamas is due to release three additional hostages Saturday, with Israel freeing dozens more Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire lasts for 42 days, about one-quarter of which has passed. It calls for the release of 33 total hostages from Gaza, as well as negotiations on the details of the second phase involving the release of the rest of the hostages, an end to the conflict and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Those negotiations are due to begin next week. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to reinforce the ceasefire. Witkoff, who played a key role in shaping the six-week truce, also inspected the Netzarim Corridor, a 6-kilometer-wide strip of land that bisects Gaza, where American security contractors have been hired to help oversee the return of displaced Palestinians. Witkoff was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Gaza in years. American officials have stayed away from the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea because of security concerns and Washington’s no-contact policy with Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Netanyahu is headed to Washington this weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited him for talks at the White House on Tuesday, his first meeting with a foreign leader since starting his second term in office. Meanwhile during the ceasefire in Gaza, Israel has ramped up its military operations in the occupied West Bank. Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a visit to the city of Jenin on Wednesday that Israel has 'declared war on Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria,' referring to the West Bank. 'The Jenin refugee camp will not return to what it was,' he said. 'After the operation is completed, the [Israel Defense Forces] will remain in the camp to ensure that terrorism does not return.' Palestinians in Gaza have been allowed back into some areas long held off-limits by Israeli troops, including northern Gaza, where the United Nations said Wednesday more than 423,000 people have returned this week. On orders from Israel, about 1 million people fled the area in the early days of the war, and those returning are going back to an area that has been decimated by Israeli military operations against Hamas. The war in Gaza started with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,400 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-to-carry-out-third-exchange-of-hostages-prisoners-under-ceasefire/7956514.html	2025-01-29T22:18:57-08:00	
State Department says Trump froze foreign aid to 'root out waste'	WASHINGTON — The State Department on Wednesday sought to clarify President Donald Trump's order to freeze and review foreign development aid after the top U.S. diplomat blunted some of the chaos that ensued with an emergency order that could shield the world's largest HIV program from the 90-day funding freeze. At the White House, Trump said his pauses to foreign and domestic funding are part of his administration's effort to root out 'tremendous waste and fraud and abuse.' Secretary of State Marco Rubio's late-Tuesday waiver exempts humanitarian aid, which he classifies as 'life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.' The United Nations' AIDS program welcomed the news, emphasizing the value of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which serves 20 million people in 55 countries. 'UNAIDS welcomes this waiver from the U.S. government, which ensures that millions of people living with HIV can continue to receive life-saving HIV medication during the assessment of U.S. foreign development assistance,' said Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. 'This urgent decision recognizes PEPFAR's critical role in the AIDS response and restores hope to people living with HIV.' 'Blocking woke programs' In a Wednesday memo sent to journalists, the State Department explained its rationale for the freeze during the review and lauded early cost cuts, saying that 'even at this early stage, over $1,000,000,000 in spending not aligned with an America First agenda has been prevented.' The U.S. spent about $70 billion in foreign aid in fiscal year 2023, the most recent data available. 'We are rooting out waste,' the memo said. 'We are blocking woke programs. And we are exposing activities that run contrary to our national interests. None of this would be possible if these programs remained on autopilot.' The president, who said Wednesday at the White House that he 'could stand here all day' and give examples of wasted fraud and abuse in the U.S. government, highlighted a few. 'We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,' he said. 'Fifty million. And you know what's happened to them? They've used them as a method of making bombs. How about that?' The State Department echoed this, saying in a statement, 'Without the pause, U.S. taxpayers would have provided condoms [and other contraceptive services] in Gaza, climate justice marketing services in Gabon, clean energy programs for women in Fiji, gender development programs in D.C., family planning throughout Latin America, sex education and pro-abortion programs for young girls globally, and much more. These types of programs do not make America stronger, safer or more prosperous.' A day earlier, the State Department sent a memo citing examples of unworthy projects, including $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International Medical Corps' work in war-battered Gaza. A USAID report says the agency delivered about $7 million worth of male condoms and about $1 million in female condoms in the 2023 fiscal year. In total, the agency said it disbursed nearly 138 million male condoms and 1.7 million female condoms worldwide. Under USAID, the main administrator for U.S. foreign development funds, the bulk of contraceptive items were delivered to African countries, according to the report. Jordan was the only country in the Middle East to receive a shipment, which consisted of injectable and oral contraceptives valued at $45,680. 'Dramatic overreach' At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers not only affirmed the need for accountability but also emphasized that Congress, not the White House, decides how U.S. taxpayer money is spent. 'I think it's appropriate to have a review,' said Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican. 'It would be my hope, however, that the aid can be reinstated and flow to Ukraine,' Cramer said. 'And then we'll see in the next appropriation cycle whether or not Congress still has the will to continue that aid.' 'This is dramatic overreach by the White House, by the president,' said Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat. 'It's unprecedented, uncalled for. This is money that we have appropriated in our role as members of the Senate and the House.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-department-says-trump-froze-foreign-aid-to-root-out-waste-/7956412.html	2025-01-29T21:31:11-08:00

Former rebel leader is Syria’s new interim president	A former rebel leader who helped defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month was named interim president of the country Wednesday. Commanders of military factions that toppled the former regime named Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has served as the de facto head of government since the fall of Assad, as president during the formation of a new government. Al-Sharra, who was once aligned with al-Qaida, is facing the daunting task of forming a temporary legislative council for the transitional period, as the previous parliament has been dissolved. Syria’s constitution has also been annulled and a new charter will be adopted. No timeline for the creation of a new parliament and Constitution has been announced. Al-Sharra is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, that spearheaded the campaign in December to take control of Damascus. Assad fled to Russia, ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. At one point, the U.S. had placed a $10 million bounty on al-Sharra, the new interim president, according to the Associated Press. The bounty was removed recently after a U.S. delegation met him in Damascus. Barbara Leaf, a top U.S. diplomat in the Middle East described al-Sharra as 'pragmatic,' after meeting him, AP reported. In a video released after the meeting with the Syrian factions, al-Sharaa said one of his top priorities in the new position will be filling 'in a legitimate and legal way' Syria’s vacuum in government. Another priority, he said, will be 'maintaining civil peace by seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks' due to Assad’s reign. Syrians took to the streets of Damascus, the capital, to celebrate the announcement of al-Sharaa's appointment. One of those celebrating was Abdallah al-Sweid who told AP that the new president 'is someone who is intelligent and has a good understanding and he was the leader of the battle that freed Syria.' Al-Sharra 'is someone who deserves to be president,' al-Sweid said. However, Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics sees al-Sharra's appointment differently. He told Reuters that the declaration of the interim president’s appointment 'formalized' al-Sharra's 'status as the strongman ruler.' Gerges said, 'My take is that HTS and Sharaa intend to consolidate single-party Islamist rule.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-rebel-leader-is-syria-s-new-interim-president/7956463.html	2025-01-29T19:27:22-08:00

Regional jet collides with helicopter near Washington's Reagan Airport	Washington — The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday night that a PSA Airlines regional jet collided midair with a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter while on approach to Reagan Washington National Airport. PSA was operating Flight 5342 for American Airlines, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, according to the FAA. According to American Airlines' website, the jet has a capacity for up to 65 passengers.

US Federal Reserve holds rates steady, sees inflation as 'elevated'	WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged Wednesday after cutting it three times in a row last year, a sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where inflation is headed and what policies President Donald Trump may pursue. In a statement, the Fed said the job market is 'solid,' and noted that the unemployment rate 'has stabilized at a low level in recent months.' The Fed also appeared to toughen its assessment of inflation, saying that it 'remains somewhat elevated.' Both a healthier job market and more stubborn inflation typically would imply fewer Fed rate cuts in the coming months. In a news conference Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell largely deflected questions about recent comments from Trump, including one from last week, when the president said he would lower oil prices and then 'demand' lower rates. He also said he would speak with Powell about it. 'I'm not going to have any response or comment on whatever the president said,' Powell said. Asked if Trump had communicated his desire for lower rates directly to Powell, the Fed chair said he had 'no contact.' Regarding the Fed's key rate, Powell conveyed a more deliberate approach, noting that the economy is mostly healthy — the unemployment rate is a low 4.1% and growth topped 3% at an annual rate in the fall. 'With ... the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,' Powell said. Asked about the potential impact of the sharp policy changes Trump has proposed regarding tariffs, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation, Powell said Fed policymakers are 'waiting to see which policies are enacted.' 'We don't know what will happen,' he added. 'We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be.' Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Financial, said Powell's comments suggest the Fed won't cut rates again until the middle of this year. 'We are all in wait-and-see mode, including the Fed,' she said. The Fed reduced its rate last year to 4.3% from 5.3%, in part out of concern that the job market was weakening. Hiring had slowed in the summer and the unemployment rate ticked up, leading Fed officials to approve an outsized half-point cut in September. Yet hiring rebounded last month and the unemployment rate declined slightly, to a low 4.1%. Powell has said it is harder to gauge where inflation is headed, in part because of increased uncertainty around what policies Trump will adopt and how quickly they will affect the economy. Higher tariffs and tax cuts could push inflation higher, while deregulation could possibly reduce it. The Fed typically keeps interest rates high to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believe those cuts won't happen until June and December. In November, inflation was just 2.4%, according to the Fed's preferred measure, not far from its 2% target. But excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose a more painful 2.8% from a year earlier. The Fed pays close attention to core prices because they are often a better guide to inflation's future path. Powell said the Fed wants to see 'real progress on inflation or ... some weakness in the labor market before we consider' making further cuts. In a post to his Truth Social account late Wednesday, Trump criticized the Fed for failing to curtail inflation, saying he would do so by 'unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing international Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing.' During the news conference, Powell was also asked about Trump's executive orders intended to limit diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which Powell has previously backed. 'As has been our practice over many administrations, we are working to align our policies with the executive orders as appropriate and consistent with applicable law,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-holds-rates-steady-sees-inflation-as-elevated-/7956433.html	2025-01-29T18:54:23-08:00	
Police say at least 30 died in stampede at India’s Maha Kumbh festival	PRAYAGRAJ, INDIA — At least 30 people were killed and many more injured in a stampede at the world's largest religious gathering early Wednesday, police said, as millions of pilgrims rushed to dip in sacred waters during the Maha Kumbh festival in northern India. Police officer Vaibhav Krishna in Prayagraj city said another 60 injured were rushed to hospitals. Wednesday was a sacred day in the six-week Hindu festival, and authorities expected a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip at the holy site can cleanse them of past sins and end the process of reincarnation. The stampede happened when pilgrims tried to jump barricades erected for a procession of holy men, Uttar Pradesh state's top elected official, Yogi Adityanath, said in a televised statement. The event's main draw is the thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who make massive processions toward the confluence to bathe. Indian authorities took more than 16 hours to release casualty figures, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the loss of lives, calling the incident 'extremely sad' and extending his condolences. 'Suddenly there was pushing in the crowd, and we got trapped. A lot of us fell down and the crowd went uncontrolled,' the Press Trust of India news agency quoted pilgrim Sarojini as saying. 'There was no chance for escape, there was pushing from all sides,' she said. Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital, desperate for news of missing loved ones. Clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the site of the stampede. Millions continued to throng the 4,000-hectare pilgrimage site despite the stampede, even as police urged them over megaphones to avoid the confluence. Adityanath urged people to take baths at other riverbanks instead. 'The situation is now under control, but there is a massive crowd of pilgrims,' Adityanath said, adding that 90 million to 100 million pilgrims were at the site. About 30 million people had taken the holy bath by 8 a.m. Wednesday, he said. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total. Nearly 150 million people have already attended, including Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay's Chris Martin. A sprawling tent city has been built on the riverbanks to accommodate the millions of visitors, with roads, electricity and water, 3,000 kitchens and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds, and more than 2,500 cameras monitor crowd movement and density so officials can try to prevent such crushes. Several opposition leaders criticized the federal and the state government, both led by Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, and blamed the stampede on 'mismanagement' and 'VIP culture' — the latter referring to what they say is preferential treatment for politicians and celebrities. 'The government should make better arrangements to meet the needs of common devotees,' Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on social platform X. The 45-day festival is a significant cultural event for India's Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of the country's more than 1.4 billion people. It's also a prestige event for Modi, whose ruling party boasts of promoting Hindu cultural symbols. The Maha Kumbh festival has had stampedes in the past. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj. Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas. In July at least 116 people died, most of them women and children, when thousands at a religious gathering in northern India stampeded at a tent camp in Hathras town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-say-at-least-30-died-in-stampede-at-india-s-maha-kumbh-festival-/7956427.html	2025-01-29T18:34:52-08:00	
Trump says he will detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay	white house — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would sign an executive action directing his administration to prepare to detain undocumented migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The U.S. detention facility is known mostly for housing military prisoners and terror suspects, including those involved in the 9/11 attacks and members of the Taliban. His order will instruct the Defense and Homeland Security departments to prepare the U.S. naval base to hold 30,000 migrants, Trump said. 'Some of them are so bad we don’t even trust the countries to hold them because we don’t want them coming back. So we’re going to send them out to Guantanamo,' Trump added. 'This will double our capacity immediately. And tough, it’s a tough place to get out of.' Trump made the announcement during a White House event during which he signed the Laken Riley Act into law. It was the first legislation he'd signed in his second term. The bill, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered last year by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, aims to expand the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally. It's unclear how the administration proposes to do this. Asked by reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said this was something the White House was 'working on, to use resources that we currently have there at Guantanamo Bay.' 'We'll go through the process,' she said, adding that the administration was working with lawmakers to fund it. She offered no estimate of the cost. A White House official, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous, told VOA that Trump had signed a presidential memorandum regarding housing migrants at Guantanamo. Presidential memoranda are less formal than executive orders. For example, they do not have to be submitted to the Federal Register for publication. Late Wednesday, the White House published the executive memorandum. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said Wednesday that U.S. Coast Guard personnel already tasked to intercept illegal migrants at sea 'can take them straight to Guantanamo Bay.' Homan told reporters that migrants had been housed there before. 'So we're just going to expand upon the existing migrant center logistics to work for that,' he said. According to a September 2024 report from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the U.S. has for decades detained migrants intercepted at sea in the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo Bay under prisonlike conditions. IRAP and other immigration rights advocates have called for the immediate closure of the migrant center. The organization also called on Congress to investigate alleged human rights abuses at the facility and called for the end of migrant detention operations everywhere. Later Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Guantanamo Bay the 'perfect place' for criminal migrants. Hegseth told Fox News that Guantanamo Bay could also temporarily hold other undocumented immigrants while they’re waiting to be sent back to their home countries. 'It's folks who maybe are in transit to their home country or a safe harbor country, and it's taking a little time to move with that processing of the paperwork,' he said, adding, 'Better they be held at a safe location, like Guantanamo Bay, which is meant and built for migrants, meant and built to sustain that away from the American people.' According to media reports, Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 710 arrests per day from Thursday through Monday, more than double the daily average of 311 recorded in the 12-month period through September under President Joe Biden. If ICE officers continue with these detentions, it would exceed the agency’s previous record set during President Barack Obama's administration in 2013, when daily arrests averaged 636. The Trump administration has intensified deportations, with ICE regularly updating arrest figures. The swift removals have sometimes created challenges in determining where to send deportees, especially when certain countries refuse to accept them. Closing Guantanamo Democratic administrations under Obama and Biden had sought to close the notorious detention camp. It was built by the George W. Bush administration in the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base facility in 2002 following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Rights groups say that Guantanamo is a symbol of U.S. disregard for the rule of law, as many detainees were held there without charge or trial. Sue Hendrickson, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said in a statement that sending migrants to Guantanamo would create a human rights catastrophe. 'Housing accused terrorists at Guantanamo has been a debacle. For the past 20 years, the U.S. government has locked up people it never even accused of taking action against the United States while continually failing to try those credibly charged with serious crimes,' she wrote. 'The Trump administration may find the symbolism of sending migrants to Guantanamo darkly appealing; its practical result would be more injustice, waste and self-inflicted loss of credibility,' Hendrickson added. At its height during the Global War on Terror, the detention facility held about 680 prisoners. According to the Pentagon, as of January 6, there were just 15 detainees at the facility. Before being used to detain terror suspects, the U.S. naval facility was also used to house migrants from Cuba and Haiti in the early 1990s, per the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. 'At one point in late 1994, the migrant population of the naval station approached 45,000,' a CRS report dated August 2022 said. The report noted the last of the migrants had left by the end of January 1996.

Generative AI makes Chinese, Iranian hackers more efficient, report says	A report issued Wednesday by Google found that hackers from numerous countries, particularly China, Iran and North Korea, have been using the company’s artificial intelligence-enabled Gemini chatbot to supercharge cyberattacks against targets in the United States. The company found — so far, at least — that access to publicly available large language models (LLMs) has made cyberattackers more efficient but has not meaningfully changed the kind of attacks they typically mount. LLMs are AI models that have been trained, using enormous amounts of previously generated content, to identify patterns in human languages. Among other things, this makes them adept at producing high-functioning, error-free computer programs. 'Rather than enabling disruptive change, generative AI allows threat actors to move faster and at higher volume,' the report found. Generative AI offered some benefits for low-skilled and high-skilled hackers, the report said. 'However, current LLMs on their own are unlikely to enable breakthrough capabilities for threat actors. We note that the AI landscape is in constant flux, with new AI models and agentic systems emerging daily. As this evolution unfolds, [the Google Threat Intelligence Group] anticipates the threat landscape to evolve in stride as threat actors adopt new AI technologies in their operations.' Google’s findings appear to agree with previous research released by other large U.S. AI players OpenAI and Microsoft, which found a similar failure to achieve novel offensive strategies for cyberattacks through the use of public generative AI models. The report clarified that Google works to disrupt the activity of threat actors when it identifies them. Game unchanged 'AI, so far, has not been a game changer for offensive actors,' Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told VOA. 'It speeds up some things. It gives foreign actors a better ability to craft phishing emails and find some code. But has it dramatically changed the game? No.' Whether that might change in the future is unclear, Segal said. Also unclear is whether further developments in AI technology will more likely benefit people building defenses against cyberattacks or the threat actors trying to defeat them. 'Historically, defense has been hard, and technology hasn't solved that problem,' Segal said. 'I suspect AI won't do that, either. But we don't know yet.' Caleb Withers, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, agreed that there is likely to be an arms race of sorts, as offensive and defensive cybersecurity applications of generative AI evolve. However, it is likely that they will largely balance each other out, he said. 'The default assumption should be that absent certain trends that we haven't yet seen, these tools should be roughly as useful to defenders as offenders,' he said. 'Anything productivity enhancing, in general, applies equally, even when it comes to things like discovering vulnerabilities. If an attacker can use something to find a vulnerability in software, so, too, is the tool useful to the defender to try to find those themselves and patch them.' Threat categories The report breaks down the kinds of threat actors it observed using Gemini into two primary categories. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors refer to 'government-backed hacking activity, including cyber espionage and destructive computer network attacks.' By contrast, information operation (IO) threats 'attempt to influence online audiences in a deceptive, coordinated manner. Examples include sock puppet accounts [phony profiles that hide users' identities] and comment brigading [organized online attacks aimed at altering perceptions of online popularity].' The report found that hackers from Iran were the heaviest users of Gemini in both threat categories. APT threat actors from Iran used the service for a wide range of tasks, including gathering information on individuals and organizations, researching targets and their vulnerabilities, translating language and creating content for future online campaigns. Google tracked more than 20 Chinese government-backed APT actors using Gemini 'to enable reconnaissance on targets, for scripting and development, to request translation and explanation of technical concepts, and attempting to enable deeper access to a network following initial compromise.' North Korean state-backed APTs used Gemini for many of the same tasks as Iran and China but also appeared to be attempting to exploit the service in its efforts to place 'clandestine IT workers' in Western companies to facilitate the theft of intellectual property. Information operations Iran was also the heaviest user of Gemini when it came to information operation threats, accounting for 75% of detected usage, Google reported. Hackers from Iran used the service to create and manipulate content meant to sway public opinion, and to adapt that content for different audiences. Chinese IO actors primarily used the service for research purposes, looking into matters 'of strategic interest to the Chinese government.' Unlike the APT sector, where their presence was minimal, Russian hackers were more common when it came to IO-related use of Gemini, using it not only for content creation but to gather information about how to create and use online AI chatbots. Call for collaboration Also on Wednesday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, used a post on the company’s blog to note the potential dangers posed by threat actors using increasingly sophisticated AI models, and calling on the industry and federal government 'to work together to support our national and economic security.' 'America holds the lead in the AI race — but our advantage may not last,' Walker wrote. Walker argued that the U.S. needs to maintain its narrow advantage in the development of the technology used to build the most advanced artificial intelligence tools. In addition, he said, the government must streamline procurement rules to 'enable adoption of AI, cloud and other game-changing technologies' by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, and to establish public-private cyber defense partnerships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/generative-ai-makes-chinese-iranian-hackers-more-efficient-report-says/7956403.html	2025-01-29T17:23:36-08:00

Former US Senator Menendez gets 11 years in prison for bribes, acting as agent of Egypt	NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez was sentenced Wednesday to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes of gold and cash and acting as an agent of Egypt — crimes his own lawyer said earned him the nickname 'Gold Bar Bob.' U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein announced the sentence after the Democrat tearfully addressed the judge, saying he’d lost everything he cared about, except for his family. 'You were successful, powerful, you stood at the apex of our political system,' the judge said. 'Somewhere along the way, and I don’t know when it was, you lost your way and working for the public good became working for your good.' Menendez’s actions, the judge said, feeds the cynicism of voters. 'What’s been the result?' he said, noting a lengthy investigation of a five-year crime. 'You lost your senate seat. You lost your chairmanship and you lost your good name.' Menendez, 71, who tearfully told the judge in court that he was chastened, was defiant when he stepped before cameras at a bank of microphones outside the Manhattan courthouse, saying: 'I am innocent.' He then railed against the judicial system and aligned himself with President Donald Trump's recent criticisms of the judicial system, particularly in New York City. 'President Trump is right. This process is political and it’s corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system,' he said, reading from a sheet of paper and calling himself the victim of 'the Wild West of political prosecutions.' Prosecutors had requested a 15-year prison term for Menendez, who was convicted of multiple charges including acting as an agent for Egypt for selling his once-considerable clout in Washington for bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Menendez: I’ve done more good than bad Given a chance to speak in court, Menendez broke down several times as he described his accomplishments. 'You really don’t know the man you are about to sentence,' Menendez told Stein as he stood before him with his hands in his pockets, except when he wiped his face several times with a tissue. 'Your honor, I am far from a perfect man. I have made more than my share of mistakes and bad decisions,' he added. 'I’ve done far more good than bad. I ask you, your honor, to judge me in that context.' Attorney Adam Fee told Stein to give Menendez credit for a 'lifetime of extraordinary public service and personal sacrifices.' 'Despite his decades of service, he is now known more widely as Gold Bar Bob,' Fee said. Menendez's lawyers had said prior to the sentencing that their client deserves less than two years in prison, describing how the son of Cuban immigrants rose from poverty to become 'the epitome of the American Dream' before his conviction had 'rendered him a national punchline.' He'd beaten a prosecution once before. In 2015, he was charged with selling his influence to a wealthy Florida eye doctor and entrepreneur who prosecutors said lavished him with luxury vacations and campaign contributions. But the jury in that case couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict. Federal prosecutors dropped the case rather than put him on trial again. Businessmen sentenced Before sentencing Menendez, Stein sentenced two men convicted of bribing Menendez, giving Fred Daibes, a real estate developer, a seven-year prison term and Wael Hana, an entrepreneur, eight years behind bars. Prior to the announcement of his sentence, Daibes, 67, tearfully told Stein the jury verdict had left him 'borderline suicidal,' and requested leniency so that he could care for his 30-year-old autistic son. Hana told the judge, 'I am an innocent man.' A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against Menendez at a trial last year. Menendez resigned from the Senate after his conviction last year, though he lost much of his power in fall 2023 when the charges against him were revealed and he was forced to surrender his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wife faces trial The trial traced Menendez’s dealings with Egyptian officials and his quest to aid three men who showered him with lucrative gifts found during a 2022 raid on the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, home he shared with his wife, Nadine. His wife faces a March trial on many of the same charges as her husband. FBI agents who searched the house found $480,000, some of it stuffed inside boots and the pockets of clothing hung in the couple's closets. They also seized gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. Prosecutors said Menendez had 'put his high office up for sale in exchange for this hoard of bribes,' including by serving Egypt’s interests as he worked to protect a meat certification monopoly Hana had established with the Egyptian government. Among other things, Menendez provided Egyptian officials with information about the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and ghostwrote a letter to fellow senators encouraging them to lift a hold on $300 million in military aid to Egypt. Prosecutors said that for other bribes, Menendez attempted to persuade a federal prosecutor in New Jersey to go easy on Daibes, a politically influential real estate developer accused of bank fraud. And at the trial, another businessman, Jose Uribe, testified that he helped Nadine Menendez get a Mercedes-Benz convertible after the senator sought to pressure state prosecutors to drop criminal probes of his associates. Menendez has insisted that he is innocent of any crime, saying repeatedly that his interactions with Egyptian officials were normal for the head of the Foreign Relations Committee, and that he always put American interests first. He denied taking any bribes and said the gold bars belonged to his wife. In court papers, Menendez's lawyers described how Menendez devoted much of his life to his country and his community after he was scarred by the early loss of his father, who killed himself when Menendez was 23 after he was unable to pay off gambling debts. They described a 50-year history of public service in heroic terms, tracing a career in which Menendez was mayor of Union City, New Jersey, a state lawmaker, a member of the U.S. House and then a senator from 2006 to 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-senator-menendez-gets-11-years-in-prison-for-bribes-acting-as-agent-of-egypt/7956117.html	2025-01-29T15:16:39-08:00

What is the Laken Riley Act? A look at the first bill Trump signed	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed the first bill of his new term, and it is named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose name became a rallying cry during his White House campaign. Trump said that he appreciated the bipartisan support for the first piece of legislation since he took office on Jan. 20. The Laken Riley Act will require the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes. The bill won bipartisan support in the House and Senate. Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, attended Wednesday's bill signing at the White House. Here are some things to know about the Laken Riley Act: Who was Laken Riley? Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing when she went out for a run on Feb. 22, 2024. Prosecutors said she encountered Jose Antonio Ibarra, who killed her during a struggle. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty in November of murder and other crimes by a judge, who alone heard and decided the case. Ibarra was sentenced to life without parole. Trump and other Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden for her death because Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an unprecedented surge in migration and released to pursue his case in immigration court. 'If this act had been the law of the land, he never would have had the opportunity to kill her,' said Representative Mike Collins, a Republican. Biden mentioned Riley during his State of the Union address last year as he spoke about border security and after Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, shouted at him, 'Say her name!' What does the bill do? Under the new law, federal officials will be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting or assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone. 'If you come into this country illegally and you commit a crime, you should not be free to roam the streets of this nation,' said Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, who helped push the bill through the Senate. The bill also empowers state attorneys general to sue the federal government for harm caused by failures or decisions in immigration enforcement that harm states or people. That includes releasing migrants from custody or failing to detain migrants who have received deportation orders. The provision gives states some power in setting immigration policy when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under the Trump and Biden administrations. While Republicans control both chambers of Congress, 46 Democrats in the House and 12 Democrats in the Senate supported the measure. Why did most Democrats oppose it? Some have raised concerns that the bill will strip due process rights for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 'In the wake of tragedy, we are seeing a fundamental erosion of our civil rights,' said Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. 'In this bill, if a person is so much as accused of a crime, if someone wants to point a finger and accuse someone of shoplifting, they would be rounded up and put into a private detention camp and sent out for deportation without a day in court.' Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill, arguing the new law will not solve immigration problems but will impose new requirements on federal authorities. Democrats on the Appropriations Committee estimate the bill will cost $83 billion over the next three years, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press. Senator Chris Murphy said the bill is 'a totally unfunded mandate.' Why did some Democrats back it? Democrats who supported it were mostly from five battleground states and said their constituents demanded more border security and supported deportations of migrants accused of crimes. 'Anyone who commits a crime should be held accountable. That’s why I voted to pass the Laken Riley Act,' Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, said on social media after its passage. New Hampshire Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Virginia Senator Mark Warner also supported the bill. Shaheen and Warner are each up for a fourth term next year. Fetterman, who also backed the bill because he wants a 'secure border,' was the first Senate Democrat to meet with Trump after the election. He has met with many of Trump’s Cabinet picks and broken with his own party on some policy. Senator Ruben Gallego, whose parents are immigrants from Mexico and Colombia, was elected in November and became Arizona's first Latino senator. He said he supported the bill. 'We must give law enforcement the means to take action when illegal immigrants break the law, to prevent situations like what occurred to Laken Riley,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-is-the-laken-riley-act-a-look-at-the-first-bill-trump-signed/7956078.html	2025-01-29T15:04:47-08:00	
Kennedy struggles to answer questions at Senate confirmation hearing for top health post	WASHINGTON — In a contentious confirmation hearing on his nomination to become the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. struggled to answer questions about how he would reform Medicaid or Medicare, the government health care programs used by millions of disabled, poor and older Americans. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician and key vote Kennedy needs to win, repeatedly pressed the nominee on Wednesday to share ways he plans to reform Medicaid, a multibillion-dollar taxpayer-funded program that covers health care for about 80 million people, including children. Republicans have said they might need to make deep cuts to Medicaid to fund President Donald Trump's proposals. 'I don't have a broad proposal for dismantling the program,' Kennedy said. Kennedy also inaccurately claimed that Medicaid is fully paid for by the federal government. It's not; states and federal taxpayers fund it. He also said most Americans have purchased a Medicare Advantage plan, when only about 1 in 10 Americans have. His misstatements about the program were peppered in between suggestions that he would seek to push privatization of the programs, repeatedly saying that most Americans like private insurance and that they dislike the government-run versions of the programs. Kennedy is seeking to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that oversees, among other things, vaccine recommendations, food inspections, hospital oversight, and funding for hundreds of community health clinics. In sometimes heated exchanges Wednesday, Kennedy denied that he is anti-vaccine. But Kennedy, who pointed out that his children are vaccinated, acknowledged he has asked 'uncomfortable questions' about vaccinations. 'I believe that vaccines play a critical role in health care,' Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee. Republicans did not ask Kennedy about his vaccine views during the first hour of the hearing. But Democrats did, with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon pointing out that Kennedy has previously claimed there's 'no safe' vaccine, initiating a back-and-forth between him and Kennedy. Wyden also quoted from Kennedy's books, which say that parents have been 'misled' on the measles vaccine. 'You have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines,' Wyden said. Over many years, Kennedy has expressed his beliefs about vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts. He's led a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He has said there is 'no vaccine that is safe and effective' and repeatedly has called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that prove they've safely prevented disease. Republicans focused on questions about agriculture, food and the abortion pill, which many women access via telemedicine systems. Kennedy tried to assure senators that he would not seek widespread bans on vaccines or food, saying he wants to provide more information to people. 'I don’t want to take food away from anybody,' he said. 'If you like a cheeseburger – a McDonald’s cheeseburger and a Diet Coke, like my boss — you should be able to get them.' Kennedy hails from one of the nation’s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid over the summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump, a Republican, in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration. Trump selected Kennedy in November, shortly after he won the presidential election, saying Kennedy would 'end the Chronic Disease epidemic' and 'Make America Great and Healthy Again!' With Kennedy being one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, his nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kennedy-struggles-to-answer-questions-at-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-top-health-post-/7956093.html	2025-01-29T15:03:43-08:00	
UN: Fighting eases in DR Congo's Goma as rebels gain 'upper hand'	UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations said Wednesday that there is relative calm in the eastern Congolese city of Goma, following several days of intense fighting between the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels and the Congolese army for control of the city. 'There is, however, continued sporadic shooting, but an overall reduction in exchanges of fire within the city,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 'Continued clashes have been reported in surrounding areas, including in Sake, northwest of Goma.' Dujarric said bodies were in the streets, and humanitarians report at least 2,000 people have been injured by weapons and shrapnel since the fighting escalated. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the mineral-rich east with the support of the Rwandan army. On Monday, M23 said it had captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and a city of more than 2 million people, thousands of whom have been displaced from other conflict areas. Rwanda has denied accusations that it supports the rebels. Asked who controls the city, Dujarric said the U.N. assessment is that the M23 rebels clearly have 'the upper hand.' The U.N. has a peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo known as MONUSCO, currently with about 10,000 troops and police tasked with protecting civilians and disarming combatants. It has been in the process of drawing down its presence at the request of the Congolese government. In June, it left neighboring South Kivu province entirely. The rebels are reported to be pushing toward its capital, Bukavu. In and around Goma, MONUSCO has reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'The mission's priority right now remains the protection of its personnel, its assets and the many civilians sheltering within U.N. premises,' Dujarric said. 'Our peacekeepers are also planning on sending out patrols today in Goma to assess the situation, to conduct resupplies and assess routes.' The U.N. says Goma’s airport remains closed, halting the flow of humanitarian supplies. Most of the roads connecting Goma with the rest of the country are also closed. Water and electricity have been cut off since Sunday, and internet access has been interrupted since Monday. Only mobile phones are working. In the capital, Kinshasa, the situation was also calm Wednesday. Dujarric said the main roads were reportedly empty, and supermarkets were closed because of the high risk of looting. On Tuesday, protesters attacked, looted and burned some embassies, including those of Belgium, France and Rwanda. The United States said Tuesday it was closing its embassy until further notice. On Wednesday it advised Americans not to travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have also called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. The East African Community, which includes DRC and Rwanda among its eight members, was expected to hold an emergency summit Wednesday evening. Reuters reported that Rwandan President Paul Kagame would attend, but Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi was not expected to participate. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-fighting-eases-in-dr-congo-s-goma-as-rebels-gain-upper-hand-/7956071.html	2025-01-29T14:34:45-08:00

White House rescinds memo freezing federal grants	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's budget office on Wednesday rescinded a memo freezing spending on federal grants, less than two days after it sparked widespread confusion and legal challenges across the country. The Monday evening memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget sparked uncertainty over a crucial financial lifeline for states, schools and organizations that rely on trillions of dollars from Washington and left the White House scrambling to explain what would and wouldn't be subject to a pause in funding. The reversal was the latest sign that even with unified control of Washington, Trump's plans to dramatically and rapidly reshape the government has some limits. The White House confirmed that OMB pulled the memo Wednesday in a two-sentence notice sent to agencies and departments but said that Trump's underlying executive orders targeting federal spending in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change remained in place. Administration officials said the notice to halt loans and grants was necessary to conduct a review to ensure that spending complies with Trump’s recent blitz of executive orders. Agencies had been directed to answer a series of yes or no questions on each federal program by Feb. 7. The questions included 'does this program promote gender ideology?' and 'does this program promote or support in any way abortion?' Still, the vaguely worded memo, combined with incomplete answers from the White House throughout the day, left lawmakers, public officials and average Americans struggling to figure out what programs would be affected by the pause. Even temporary interruptions in funding could cause layoffs or delays in public services. The freeze was scheduled to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday but was stayed by a federal judge until at least Monday after an emergency hearing requested by nonprofit groups that receive federal grants. An additional lawsuit by Democratic state attorneys general was also pending. 'The Executive Orders issued by the President on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, blaming the confusion on the courts and news outlets, not the administration. 'This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the President’s orders on controlling federal spending.' Administration officials insisted that despite the confusion, the order still had its intended effect by underscoring to federal agencies their obligations to abide by Trump's executive orders. Although Trump had promised to turn Washington upside down if elected to a second term, the effects of his effort to pause funding were being felt far from the nation’s capital. Organizations such as Meals on Wheels, which receives federal money to deliver food to the elderly, and Head Start, which provides early childcare in lower-income communities, were worried about getting cut off. On Tuesday, Trump administration officials said programs that provide direct assistance to Americans, including Medicare, Social Security, student loans and food stamps, would not be affected. But they sometimes struggled to provide a clear picture. Leavitt initially would not say whether Medicaid was exempted from the freeze, but the administration later clarified that it was. Democratic critics of the order moved swiftly to celebrate the action. 'This is an important victory for the American people whose voices were heard after massive pressure from every corner of this country — real people made a difference by speaking out,' said Senator Patty Murray. 'Still, the Trump administration — through a combination of sheer incompetence, cruel intentions and a willful disregard of the law — caused real harm and chaos for millions over the span of the last 48 hours which is still ongoing.' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said, 'Americans fought back, and Donald Trump backed off.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-rescinds-memo-freezing-federal-grants/7956004.html	2025-01-29T13:31:14-08:00	
Online child sexual exploitation increasing in Kenya, says report	NAIROBI, KENYA — For young people like Winnie Muyam, accessing digital platforms was her way to connect with friends and entertainment, until last year when the 17-year-old said strangers began to chat with her. 'They started talking to me as a friend, telling me how beautiful I was,' she said. 'From there they started sending pictures. They wanted to see my private parts and I felt so bad.' The teenager said her efforts to flag her abusers through the platform's reporting tools were futile. Her complaint was not acted upon. While Muyam was able to avoid exploitation, up to 13% of minors online have been exploited or abused, according to a survey by Child Fund International and Africa Child forum. A majority of the targeted children are 12 to 17 years old. The fund’s child advocacy and protection manager, Eunice Kilundo, said perpetrators try to play on their victims’ desperation for affection. 'They will pose as a very good friend,' said Kilundo. 'They even give children rewards and lure them into going deeper and deeper up to the point where probably they may want children to send them their nudes and all that.' In a fast-changing digital world, parents, caregivers, communities and governments face new challenges in keeping children safe, UNICEF said. Researchers say a low capacity to investigate and prosecute online sexual exploitation in Africa creates a fertile ground for potential offenders. So Kenyan authorities are training officers in the justice system to handle such cases. Kilundo said concerted efforts to combat such abuse will go a long way. 'It's a high time everybody in the children sector — or even outside the children sector, the corporate, government, everyone — to demonstrate commitment and concern,' said Kilundo. Kenyan law prohibits any sexual involvement with children under 18 years old, including online, without permission of a parent or guardian. Dennis Otieno, senior counsel for Kenya’s Federation of Female Lawyers, told VOA that although such crimes can be prosecuted, some caregivers are oblivious to them and making them aware is crucial. 'The report rate for such cases is very low,' said Otieno. 'Many people still do not understand there are crimes that can be committed through social media.' More than 22 million people in Kenya have access to the internet, according to national data, and with increasing access to digital platforms, authorities believe programs such as this training will help keep children online safe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/online-child-sexual-exploitation-increasing-in-kenya-says-report/7955952.html	2025-01-29T13:25:58-08:00	
WHO warns polio progress in Afghanistan, Pakistan at risk due to US funding cut	ISLAMABAD — A senior World Health Organization official cautioned Wednesday that the eradication of polio in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the only countries where the paralytic virus persists, is threatened by the suspension of funding from the United States. In an online news conference, Hanan Balkhy, regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean, emphasized the crucial role of U.S. financial contribution to the organization's surveillance efforts for polio and all other communicable diseases, particularly within her region. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an unprecedented 90-day suspension of almost all foreign aid to give his administration the time to evaluate whether to continue funding the numerous humanitarian, development and security programs that receive U.S. assistance. On his first day back in the White House, Trump announced he was withdrawing the United States from WHO. His executive order accused the United Nations agency of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, as well as failing 'to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.' Balkhy referred to Trump's announcement to withdraw from WHO as 'very unfortunate' and highlighted that the U.S. has been a 'major' supporter of her organization's work in the Eastern Mediterranean region for decades. 'The U.S. funding was indeed decisive in fighting polio, eradicating polio. Currently, we are in the last round of eradicating polio in the last two countries in the world: Afghanistan and Pakistan,' the Saudi physician said through an interpreter. 'We hope that our collaboration with our partners will enable us to achieve our goal of fully eradicating polio in these countries during this final stage,' she added. Balkhy emphasized WHO's dedication to safeguarding the world against the resurgence of polio. In 2024, Pakistan reported 73 cases of the paralytic poliovirus, while Afghanistan reported 25 cases. Although there have been no additional polio cases in Afghanistan so far, Pakistani officials confirmed the first poliovirus infection of 2025 last week. Balkhy attributed efforts led by WHO to contain what she described as the 'inevitable' spread of polio in Gaza due to the destruction of its sewage and sanitation services. She stated they are prepared to discuss the reforms the United States plans to propose and carry out necessary internal assessments to help advance the organization's work. 'Funding shortfalls in 2024 have already led to devastating cuts to lifesaving health operations. We ask for your support in amplifying our message — help us save lives, restore health systems and bring hope to millions,' Balkhy said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7955883.html	2025-01-29T12:29:48-08:00	
African Union demands halt to fighting in eastern DR Congo	NAIROBI, KENYA — The African Union and other regional bodies on late Tuesday called for an immediate halt to fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The M23 rebel group seized control of eastern Congo’s largest city, Goma, on Monday. According to some residents who spoke to VOA, Goma is calm after two days of heavy fighting. Residents who ventured out Wednesday saw bodies on the streets, some in military uniforms and others in civilian clothes. The regional bodies called for M23 to withdraw from the city, a move security experts say will be difficult for the rebel group to accept. The East African Community bloc has called for a summit to address the tension between the DRC and Rwanda, which Kinshasa accuses of backing M23. Rwandan authorities deny the charge. According to Congolese state media, President Felix Tshisekedi will not attend the talks. Meanwhile, calm returned to Kinshasa on Wednesday, a day after angry protesters attacked the embassies of Belgium, France, Kenya and Uganda as well as Rwanda. The protesters accused the other countries of supporting Rwanda. The embassies either condemned or expressed deep concern over the attacks. The United States closed its embassy in Kinshasa to the public on Tuesday and called on its citizens to review their safety and travel plans. On Wednesday it advised Americans not to travel to the DRC. Chacha Nyaigotti-Chacha, a Kenyan expert in international relations and diplomacy, said he does not think the protests will affect the DRC’s relations with the affected countries. In regard to the fighting in the east, the DRC’s government needs to address and solve its internal problems, said Chrispin Mvano, a Congolese political and security researcher in Goma. 'The conflict in DR Congo isn't just about disputes with other countries,' Mvano said. 'It also stems from internal divisions among the Congolese people. Even as talks continue in Nairobi, lasting stability depends on resolving these internal issues. If Congolese leaders and communities don't engage in dialogue and address their differences in Kinshasa, the peace talks alone are unlikely to bring real stability.' The DRC is home to over 100 armed groups, many fighting for control of resources and mining areas. In the latest conflict, the Congolese army and the allied Wazalendo militia retreated from the city, with some soldiers surrendering at the U.N. peacekeeping base in Goma. Great Lakes region security analyst Dismas Nkunda said Kinshasa needs to build a strong army to confront rebels. 'M23, they are very well-equipped. ... If the DRC government does not up its game, then it's going to be very difficult for them to be able to maintain [a] semblance of peace when they have well-armed and well-supported armed groups like M23,' Nkunda said. Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwama Wagner said in an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that more than half a million people in eastern Congo were displaced this month and that the humanitarian situation there is getting worse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-union-demands-halt-to-fighting-in-eastern-dr-congo/7955855.html	2025-01-29T12:16:15-08:00

Debate rages over Trump's push to end birthright citizenship	Washignton — President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. has ignited a legal and political debate, raising questions about the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the extent of presidential power. The amendment guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. 'We're the only country in the world that does this with birthright, as you know. And it's just absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, we'll see. We think we have very good grounds and certain people have wanted to do this for decades,' Trump said while signing the executive order on his first day in office. The United States is one of about 30 countries that grant automatic citizenship to individuals born on their soil, including Brazil, Mexico, and Canada, among others. The practice is known as jus soli (Latin for 'right of the soil'). But the U.S. remains notable for its broad application of unconditional jus soli, as enshrined in the 14th Amendment. Are there limits to 14th Amendment? The amendment, ratified in 1868, was designed to address citizenship questions following the U.S. Civil War and to overrule the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied African Americans citizenship. The text reads: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' 'This language ratifies the traditional understanding that anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen,' John Yoo, a professor at University of California Berkeley Law School and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institute, told VOA in a phone intervie However, critics argue that the phrase 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' implies that at least one parent must be a U.S. citizen for a child to be granted citizenship. According to Yoo, this interpretation aligns more closely with the European jus sanguinis, or 'law of blood' approach, which ties citizenship to parentage rather than birthplace. 'To me, that just doesn’t make sense of the language of the 14th Amendment and historical practice,' Yoo said. 'The Supreme Court, in cases like United States v. Wong Kim Ark, has consistently interpreted the amendment to mean birthright citizenship.' Critics of Trump’s executive order say the 14th Amendment is a cornerstone of civil rights in the United States. 'The 14th amendment, it was created to give birthright citizenship. … Constitutional rights cannot be taken away by a president. They can only be taken away by Congress, and thus the executive order is illegal,' said Tuyet Duong, an immigration lawyer and policy expert with the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. However, supporters of the executive order argue a more limited interpretation of the amendment is warranted. 'President Trump has made it clear that restoring fairness to our immigration system and defending the true intent of the 14th Amendment are central to his vision of making America great again,' Republican Congressman Brian Babin of Texas, told reporters during a press conference last Thursday. Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, wrote in a report in 2019 that there is good reason for the United States to reconsider its long-standing policy of automatically granting citizenship to everyone born on U.S. soil. Swearer argued that the 14th Amendment was intended to give birthright citizenship only to those U.S.-born children whose parents were 'like the freed slaves, subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States. In a modern immigration context, this would mean that the Constitution only mandates birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of citizens, nationals, and lawful permanent residents.' Legal challenges Trump’s executive order is facing significant legal challenges, with multiple lawsuits in progress. Twenty-two Democratic-led states have filed a lawsuit arguing the order violates the 14th Amendment. A federal judge in Seattle has temporarily stopped the birthright citizenship order from taking effect. Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour of Seattle temporarily blocked it, describing it as 'blatantly unconstitutional.' But if the case reaches the Supreme Court, the outcome could reshape the nation’s understanding of citizenship. If the court were to side with Trump, the most immediate impact will be on newborns and those yet to receive birth certificates and Social Security numbers. And questions about retroactive application would arise. 'Figuring out how this rule would operate retroactively is extremely complex. Would it deny citizenship to people born here historically without citizen parents? How far back would it go? These are precisely the issues the 14th Amendment was designed to avoid,' Yoo told VOA. While much of the focus is on judicial challenges, Yoo pointed out that Congress could settle the issue legislatively. 'Congress could extend birthright citizenship by statute, reaffirming the traditional understanding. But it’s unclear what Congress might do in this politically charged environment,' Yoo said. Still, he believes the Supreme Court would uphold birthright citizenship. 'The text of the 14th Amendment, its history, and consistent Supreme Court rulings all point to birthright citizenship,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/debate-rages-over-trump-s-push-to-end-birthright-citizenship/7955708.html	2025-01-29T10:23:50-08:00	
West Africa bloc announces formal exit of three junta-led states	LAGOS, NIGERIA — The Economic Community of West Africa States, ECOWAS, on Wednesday announced the formal exit of junta-led Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger from the bloc following their withdrawal last year. West Africa has been rocked by a spate of coups that has countries in the 15-member body under military rule over the past five years. 'The withdrawal of Burkina Faso, the Republic of Mali and Republic of Niger has become effective today, 29th January 2025,' ECOWAS said in a statement. The three states announced their withdrawal from the bloc last January after ECOWAS demanded a restoration of democratic rule in Niger following a military coup in 2023. Instead, the three breakaway states formed Alliance of Sahel States, an alternate bloc and launched their own biometric passports. ECOWAS said on Wednesday the remaining members tentatively agreed to 'keep ECOWAS doors open' by recognizing national passports and identity bearing the bloc's logo from the countries, to continue trade under existing regional agreement, and to continue diplomatic cooperation with the countries. In December, ECOWAS gave Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger a six-month grace period to rethink their exit. 'These arrangements will be in place until the full determination of the modalities of our future engagement with the three countries of by the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government,' ECOWAS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/west-africa-bloc-announces-formal-exit-of-three-junta-led-states-/7955666.html	2025-01-29T09:26:28-08:00	
Plane crashes in South Sudan, killing 20, official says	NAIROBI — A small aircraft carrying oil workers in South Sudan's Unity State crashed on Wednesday, killing 20 people, an official said. The plane crashed at the Unity oilfield airport on Wednesday morning as it was heading to the capital Juba, said Gatwech Bipal, Unity State's information minister. Bipal said the passengers were oil workers of the Greater Pioneer Operating Company, or GPOC, a consortium that includes China National Petroleum Corporation and state-owned Nile Petroleum Corporation. He said among the dead were two Chinese nationals and one Indian. Bipal gave no more details on the circumstances that led to the crash. Media reports had initially put the death toll at 18 but Bipal told Reuters two survivors had later died. One person survived. Several air crashes have occurred in war-torn South Sudan in recent years. In September 2018, at least 19 people died when a small aircraft carrying passengers from the capital Juba to the city of Yirol crashed. In 2015, dozens of people were killed when a Russian-built cargo plane with passengers on board crashed after taking off from the airport in the capital Juba.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-in-south-sudan-killing-20-official-says/7955609.html	2025-01-29T09:13:59-08:00

Trump’s push for Greenland shakes up Arctic island’s politics	Nuuk, Greenland — The road south from Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, runs out at the tip of a blizzard-scoured peninsula stretching into the Labrador Sea. Icebergs drift beyond the sea ice toward the open ocean, carved off the glacier some 100 kilometers away at the head of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord. Locals call this spot 'the edge of the world.' For local Inuit artist and researcher Vivi Vold, it is a place of spiritual power, somewhere she comes to connect with nature – intrinsic to her Greenlandic identity. 'It reminds me that I am Inuk, that I am Greenlandic… when I am in doubt and want to reconnect with myself and my Greenlandic identity, I find solace in nature,' Vold told VOA. In her work, Vold researches Inuit 'ways of knowing' and how they differ from Western concepts. 'I sense that there is more pride now than earlier. The pride has always been there, but it seems like now there is more acceptance of it. Everything I do as a researcher is about the land and the nature; hunting, the climate, and the way we think,' she said. Greenlandic pride A resurgence in indigenous pride can be felt across Greenlandic society. The eyes of the world are on this Arctic island, thanks largely to U.S. President Donald Trump. In Greenlandic politics and media, in the pubs and coffee bars, and on social media, the conversation is about the island’s future. There is excitement - but also trepidation. President Trump has repeatedly said that America needs to take control of Greenland from Denmark for, in his words, 'international security.' 'I do believe Greenland, we’ll get, because it really has to do with freedom of the world... And you know what, the people don't like the way they've been treated by Denmark. They don't like the way they've been treated by Denmark and they do like us,' Trump told reporters Saturday on Air Force One. Meanwhile, Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, attempted to build European solidarity in the face of the challenge posed by Trump’s comments Tuesday, visiting Berlin, Paris and NATO headquarters in Brussels in the space of a single day. Local media reported that France offered to send troops to Greenland in a show of unity with Copenhagen, but the offer was turned down. A poll released on Wednesday, commissioned by the Danish Berlingske newspaper and the Sermitsiaq newspaper in Greenland, suggested that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, with 6% in favor and 9% undecided. However, almost half of respondents said they saw an opportunity with Trump's interest in Greenland, with the other half seeing it as a threat. The poll did not ask respondents whether they wanted to break ties with Denmark and become independent. A 2019 survey suggested that more than two-thirds of the Greenlanders want independence at some point in the future. Danish colonization A statue of the Norwegian-Danish missionary Hans Egede stands over the capital Nuuk. Greenlanders have lived under varying degrees of Danish rule ever since he landed here in 1721. In recent years, the statue has been daubed with graffiti calling for its removal and for Greenland’s independence from Denmark. Nevertheless, in a 2020 poll, 62% of Greenlanders voted to keep the statue in place. Greenland’s government is now largely autonomous and pushing for full independence. Under the terms of an agreement with Denmark, the territory has a right to hold a referendum on the issue. 'Things are changing in the world. We don't know yet. But we need to have that discussion in Greenland without the outside world requiring us to give an answer to the end goal,' said Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for resources, business, justice and gender equality. 'We need to be able to discuss amongst ourselves how will independence look like, what kind of welfare do we want, what kind of democracy, what kind of institutions should guard it, what kind of constitution. We want those debates for ourselves,' she told VOA. Independence challenges Could Greenland stand on its own? Just 57,000 people inhabit the island’s 2.1 million square kilometers. Denmark pays an annual grant of around $800 million dollars, which makes up half the Greenland government’s revenue. Trump may balk at the cost, said Marc Jacobsen, a researcher at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'I'm not really sure if they are aware of what the cost is to keep a high living standard in Greenland with the welfare system as we know from the Nordic states. So, in comparison with the Inuit in Alaska or for instance [the indigenous people] in Puerto Rico, it's a different living standard in Greenland. And that comes with a cost,' he told VOA. There are hopes that the global attention now focused on Greenland will unlock investment to exploit its vast mineral wealth, which includes graphite, uranium and valuable rare earth metals. 'The problem is pretty much that they are staying there at the moment because nobody's investing in getting them out,' said Ulrik Pram Gad, an expert on Greenland’s mineral wealth at the Danish Institute for International Studies. 'And that's not a question of Greenlanders not wanting it or Denmark not allowing it. It's a question of the only supply chains that exist concerning many of these resources are in China. And the Western world, you might say, cannot present a credible business model to the private companies that would in principle be able to use these materials.' Tourism A new international airport opened in November, making access to Nuuk much easier. International flights currently depart for Denmark, Canada and Iceland – but United Airlines is due to begin direct flights from New York later this year. Greenland’s stark beauty is attracting more tourists. 'The international airport in Nuuk has opened up; there will be another one in Ilulissat where the fantastic ice-shelf glacier is. So there are opportunities for growth in tourism. There's really a lot of desire for relations not just to the U.S., but to Canada, to Iceland, to Europe, to everybody. And if this turns into that, I think many Greenlanders will be happy,' Pram Gad told VOA. For now, fishing is Greenland’s biggest industry by far, making up around 85% of total exports. It is deeply entwined with the Greenlandic way of life. Jesper Jacobsen runs a fishing cooperative in Nuuk. In the depths of the January winter, customers drop in to buy cod and halibut, along with duck and reindeer meat brought in by local hunters. Whale, bear and walrus are sometimes available. 'We have fish and we have natural resources,' Jacobsen said. 'And the Americans could pay a lot of money to rent the northern part of Greenland. They could use it for their military. Then we will have our independence because the Americans will pay a lot to rent the northern part of Greenland,' he told VOA. 'Make Greenland Great Again' A ‘Make America Great Again’ or MAGA hat hangs in Jacobsen’s office, given by Donald Trump Jr.’s entourage when the U.S. president’s son visited Greenland in early January. The visit continues to cause a stir. YouTubers arrived in the wake of the younger Trump’s visit, handing out U.S. dollars and hats bearing the slogan ‘Make Greenland Great Again.’ Some locals criticized the social media stunt. Others welcomed the attention. 'I don't want to be a part of Denmark. I don't like [the] Danish. They took children and they colonized us,' said 20-year-old student Hans Louis Petersen, proudly showing off his 'Make Greenland Great Again' baseball cap. Scandals Petersen referenced a 1950s social experiment run by the Danish state, where Greenlandic children were taken to Denmark, sometimes without the full understanding of their parents. Many struggled to re-integrate when they returned. Separately, in recent years it emerged that Danish doctors in the 1960s and 70s had implanted IUD contraceptive devices in Inuit women and girls without their permission, allegedly to limit population growth. A group of 67 Greenlanders is currently seeking $6.3 million in compensation from the Danish state. An investigation into the program is expected to be published later this year. The scandals have further fueled the campaign for independence. 'I think there is a lack of understanding of the impact of these cases in Greenland,' said Greenlandic Minister Naaja Nathanielsen. 'It's not ancient history, it's current history. We right now have women, men, families that are directly affected by the actions of the Danish state in the past. It's traumatizing and some of them have not been able to become mothers.' 'This is not some cases that should be solved in a courtroom. They should be solved politically and with the proper amount of respect and understanding and assuming responsibility for the hurt inflicted on the Greenlandic people. And it's absolutely necessary for us to move forward,' Nathanielsen told VOA. Outside forces are building pressure on the government. The island’s prime minister, Mute B. Egede, has repeated the same message when questioned on Trump’s aim to take control of the territory. 'We have said very precisely that Greenland, and us in this country, do not want to be Americans. We don't want to be Danes either,' Egede said in a televised debate on January 20. 'We are Greenlanders. We will stand firmly as Greenlanders and cooperate with the West. We will also cooperate with other countries in the world,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-push-for-greenland-shakes-up-arctic-island-s-politics/7955482.html	2025-01-29T07:51:18-08:00	
Year of the Snake is underway with Lunar New Year festivities	BEIJING — Lunar New Year festivals and prayers marked the start of the Year of the Snake around Asia and farther afield on Wednesday — including in Moscow. Hundreds of people lined up in the hours before midnight at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist temple in Hong Kong in a bid to be among the first to put incense sticks in the stands in front of the temple’s main hall. 'I wish my family will be blessed. I hope my business will run well. I pray for my country and wish people peace. I hope this coming year is a better year,' said Ming So, who visits the temple annually on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The holiday — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated by diaspora communities around the world. The snake, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, follows the just-ended Year of the Dragon. The pop-pop-pop of firecrackers greeted the new year outside Guan Di temple in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, followed by lion dances to the rhythmic beat of drums and small cymbals. Ethnic Chinese holding incense sticks in front of them bowed several times inside the temple before sticking the incense into elaborate gold-colored pots, the smoke rising from the burning tips. Many Chinese who work in bigger cities return home during the eight-day national holiday in what is described as the world’s biggest annual movement of humanity. Beijing, China's capital, has turned into a bit of a ghost town, with many shops closed and normally crowded roads and subways empty. Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year's Eve and visit 'temple fairs' on the Lunar New Year to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets from booths. Many Chinese take advantage of the extended holiday to travel in the country and abroad. Ctrip, an online booking agency that operates Trip.com, said the most popular overseas destinations this year are Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United States, South Korea, Macao and Vietnam. Russians cheered, waved and took smartphone photos of a colorful procession with drummers, costumed dancers and large dragon and snake figures held aloft that kicked off a 10-day Lunar New Year festival in Moscow on Tuesday night. Visitors shouted 'Happy New Year' in Russian and expressed delight at being able to experience Chinese food and culture in Moscow, including folk performances and booths selling snacks and artwork.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-of-the-snake-is-underway-with-lunar-new-year-festivities/7955461.html	2025-01-29T07:48:31-08:00	
Somali general confident of defeat against IS	For almost a month, security forces in the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland have been advancing on the mountainous hideouts of Islamic State militants. The fiercest clashes occurred late last week when the regional forces dislodged the militants from Turmasaale, a strategic location about 150 kilometers southeast of Bosaso. Puntland’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, went to the airport over the weekend to meet wounded soldiers, including a senior officer, a sign of clashes taking place. Before the Turmasaale clashes, the region’s forces seized caves, camps and small villages largely unopposed. Brigadier General Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who until recently was the commander of special operations for the Somali army and has been following the offensive in his home region, said losing Turmasaale was a blow for IS as it was the militants’ main supply route. 'This is where they were coordinating both attacks — mainly drone-deployed ammunition, IEDs, attacking the Puntland forces — but also getting their resupply, whether it's rations or whatever. So it was a strategic achievement by the Puntland forces,' he said. He said both sides suffered casualties from the fighting over Turmasaale, the biggest confrontation so far. 'There has been almost daily fighting. The Puntland forces have suffered casualties, mainly from IEDs, which is the weapon of choice of terrorism everywhere,' he said. 'But they have been progressing on very well for the past three weeks. And they have captured several important locations. The regional forces so far have the upper hand for sure.' The IS group’s main camps, located in the vicinity of Dhaadaar village, have yet to be reached. The IS group claimed responsibility for attacks against Puntland forces, including a deadly suicide attack on Dec. 31, 2024, which the group said was carried out by militants from multiple countries. Sheikh said he believes Puntland forces can achieve a military victory against IS before Ramadan, which starts in four weeks. 'This operation was planned very well. It was prepared very well,' he said. 'The mobilization was exceptional. and they have huge support from the local communities, which is very important.' Sheikh said the presence of foreign fighters in the Islamic State camps gives both locals and Puntland forces extra motivation. 'If you capture their bases and camps and strategic headquarters, that for me will be the measurement of victory,' he added. IS presence in Somalia small but growing It has been 10 years since about two dozen al-Shabab fighters defected from the group, set up an Islamic State Somalia branch and gave allegiance to the group’s then-leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group remained small for years but appealed to foreign fighters who came to Somalia, mainly from the Middle East and from other parts of East Africa. Some U.S. officials also believe that IS Somalia’s leader, Abdulkadir Mumin, is also the emir of IS global. Others disagree but there is consensus that Mumin is nonetheless a pivotal figure, with a recent United Nations report naming him as the group’s directorate of provinces, 'placing him in a leadership role over [IS] affiliates in Africa.' On the ground, observers believe Mumin is in firm control of the group as leader, as well as a dealmaker who acts between the locals and militants. The office of IS in Somalia was already documented to run the terrorist group’s financial network. The U.S. supports Somali security forces, training the elite Danab forces in multiple locations. The U.S. has also conducted airstrikes against al-Shabab and Islamic State, with 10 reported strikes in 2024. One of the strikes killed Mohamed Mire, a top al-Shabab commander, on Dec. 24 in southern Somalia. Sheikh himself was trained by the U.S. and previously served as the commander of Danab. A U.S. defense official declined to comment on the anti-IS operation underway in Puntland but said the United States has not wavered in its support for Somali forces. 'The Department [of Defense] remains committed to supporting our partners in our shared efforts to disrupt, degrade, and defeat VEOs [violent extremist organizations] in the Horn of Africa,' the official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing counterterror efforts. The Pentagon 'has maintained a long-term focus on working with African partner nations to build defense institutional capacity and enable partnered operations … with a particular focus on countering al-Shabab and ISIS-Somalia,' the official said, pointing, in particular, to more than a decade of support for the Danab Brigade. The Trump administration withdrew U.S. forces from Somalia during the last few weeks of its first term in January 2021. But President Joe Biden reversed the decision in May 2022, sending in about 500 U.S. special operation forces to help Somali forces counter both IS and al-Shabab. Some Somali officials fear a similar disengagement with Trump back in the White House. Sheikh said he 'doubts' it will be repeated. 'The terrorism is still a real threat and obviously is the threat in Somalia,' he said. Abdi Hassan Hussein 'Abdi Yare' is Puntland’s former chief of police and former head of the region’s intelligence agency. He said the campaign to combat Islamic State is crucial for the broader security of Somalia and the region, as this group poses a security danger to all countries in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Abdi Yare cautioned that the fighting could last a long time. 'It is difficult to predict the damage that can be done, and it is true that the area to be fought is very difficult in terms of traffic, necessitating the troops to carry infantry or guerrilla warfare, which may prolong the war,' he said. Yare does not think the group’s power has diminished significantly. 'The group's power has not diminished; it is still quite strong, and it is prepared for a long-term conflict, having drilled holes in Mount Al-Madow to deliver food, military equipment, and all necessary materials,' he said. He estimates the group has between 1,200 and 1,600 fighters. That number is still unverified. For a long time, experts believed IS fighters in Somalia numbered only a few hundred. A report issued this past November by the United Nations Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia, based on member state intelligence, estimated IS-Somalia had more than doubled in size to between 600 and 700 fighters. It further warned the terror group’s numbers in Puntland were boosted by an influx of fighters from Ethiopia, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania and Yemen. Some experts told VOA they expected the trend to continue. Abdi Yare predicts Mumin could flee to Yemen if the group is defeated in Puntland. He also warned that IS militants could resort to desperate attacks targeting civilians in populated cities like Bosaso.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-general-confident-of-defeat-against-is/7955486.html	2025-01-29T07:47:59-08:00	
Defense secretary pulls Trump critic Gen. Milley's security clearance, protective detail	Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is pulling the security protections and clearance of retired Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Mark Milley, and he has ordered the Pentagon's inspector general to review Milley's actions while serving as the nation's top uniformed officer to determine if a demotion is warranted, two defense officials confirmed late Tuesday. The inspector general review will include 'an inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding Gen Milley’s conduct so that the Secretary may determine whether it is appropriate to reopen his military grade review determination,' said Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot. 'The Secretary informed General Milley today that he is revoking the authorization for his security detail and suspending his security clearance as well,' he said. Milley served as chairman during President Donald Trump's first term in office. While the relationship initially went well, it soured deeply and fast, as Milley tried to advise and contain the president on a host of issues. Milley pushed back on the president's interest in using force domestically to quell protestors after the death of George Floyd, and he was at the center of a controversy in 2021 when he made independent calls to his Chinese counterpart. Trump called the calls an act of treason, but at the time Milley said the calls were routine and part of the scope of his job. Milley in his final days as chairman after Trump had left office was equally outspoken about his former boss. He said at his official retirement ceremony ' we don’t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator.' 'We don’t take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we’re willing to die to protect it,' he said at the time. Hegseth's chief of staff Joe Kasper said that the decision to strip Milley of his clearance and detail was taken because 'undermining the chain of command is corrosive to our national security, and restoring accountability is a priority for the Defense Department under President Trump’s leadership.' The moves, which were first reported by Fox News, also may include taking down Milley's Army chief of staff portrait. Milley's chairman portrait was stripped from the wall just hours after Trump was sworn in. The portraits were both paid for by a donation from the Association of the United States Army, not taxpayer dollars, and were a gift to Milley honoring his service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/defense-secretary-pulls-trump-critic-gen-milley-s-security-clearance-protective-detail/7955395.html	2025-01-29T06:32:38-08:00

Australian police foil antisemitic attack involving explosives	SYDNEY — Australian police said on Wednesday they had foiled a planned antisemitic attack after discovering a caravan containing explosives, in an escalation of threats against the Jewish community that authorities called terrorism. The caravan was discovered on Jan. 19 in Dural, a suburb some 36 kms northwest of the center of Sydney, New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference. 'That caravan contained an amount of explosives, and some indication that those explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,' he told a news conference. The threat had been fully contained and there was no further threat to the Jewish community, he added. Hudson said arrests had been made but did not disclose how many or what the charges were. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said over 100 officers were investigating the incident, under a joint counter-terrorism operation involving state and federal police. 'This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event. There is only one way of calling it out, and that is terrorism,' he said. Australia has suffered a spate of antisemitic incidents in recent months, with attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war in late 2023. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose center-left Labor Party faces reelection in polls that must be held by May, has been criticized by the opposition over the rise in antisemitic incidents in the country. The government says it has taken extra steps to protect the Jewish community, including more funding and a federal taskforce to investigate antisemitic incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-police-foil-antisemitic-attack-involving-explosives-/7955227.html	2025-01-29T03:43:15-08:00	
Plan to get electricity to more Africans wins $8B in new pledges	DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA — An initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity in the next six years has won new pledges worth more than $8 billion from lenders including the Islamic Development Bank and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Mission 300 initiative, launched by the World Bank and the African Development Bank in April, is projected to cost $90 billion. Its implementation faces challenges because the economies of countries in the region are severely constrained, mainly due to sluggish revenue and high debt service costs. 'Our national balance sheets are insufficient... to achieve Mission 300's objectives,' Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema told an Africa energy summit in Tanzania. Funding for the project is expected to come from multilateral development banks, development agencies, private businesses and philanthropic organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation, which is part of the initiative. Muhammad al Jasser, chairman of the Islamic Development Bank, said in a statement released during the summit that ended on Tuesday, that the Jeddah-headquartered bank was committing $2.65 billion in project financing and another $2 billion to insure power projects in Africa. Beijing-based AIIB is set to provide $1-1.5 billion in financing. 'Six hundred million people in Africa without access to electricity is intolerable,' said AIIB President Jin Liqun. Others funding the project include the French Development Agency (AFD), which committed to providing $1.04 billion, and the OPEC Fund for International Development, which made an initial commitment of $1 billion, the AfDB said in a closing statement. The additional finance builds on commitments of up to $48 billion from the World Bank and the AfDB, officials at the summit said. The two organizations' contributions could be increased during implementation, they said. Provision of 300 million people with access to electricity, half of those currently without power on the continent, is a crucial building block for boosting Africa's development by creating new jobs, said World Bank President Ajay Banga. Half of the targeted new connections will get electricity from existing national grids, officials said at the summit, while the other half will be from renewable energy sources, including wind and solar mini-grids. Apart from lighting up homes and businesses, Mission 300 is expected to boost the provision of clean cooking energy to homes, cutting reliance on wood and charcoal which are harmful, said Tanzania's president, Samia Suluhu Hassan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plan-to-get-electricity-to-more-africans-wins-8b-in-new-pledges/7955202.html	2025-01-29T02:23:45-08:00	
Trump administration offers resignation program amid effort to shrink federal workforce	The Trump administration issued a memo Tuesday offering federal government workers a financial incentive to leave their posts by the end of September. The resignation program is part of the administration’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce. An email to many of the 2 million federal workers said they could remain on the government payroll until Sept. 30, the end of the government’s fiscal year, and could have their work duties reduced or eliminated in the interim. Those workers would also be exempt from a Trump mandate that employees need to return to working in their offices full time. Employees have until Feb. 6 to accept the offer, and were directed to do so with an email reply with the word 'resign.' The potential impact of the program on tax-payer services was not clear. 'While a few agencies and even branches of the military are likely to see increases in the size of their workforce, the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,' the memo said. People working in immigration, national security and for the Postal Service were not part of the offer. The memo also said the 'federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work.' Unions representing federal employees criticized the administration’s move. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal workers, told its members the resignation memo 'is designed to entice or scare you into resigning' and said 'we strongly urge you not to resign in response.' Everett Kelley, head of the American Federation of Government Employees union that includes some VOA employees, said in a statement that the offer 'should not be viewed as voluntary' and that the administration’s actions show its goal is 'to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.'

Tiger poachers use fishing boats to smuggle body parts out of Malaysia, study shows	Bangkok — Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in trafficking parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to research released Wednesday that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat. The fishing boats are part of a network of routes used by sophisticated teams of poachers to move parts of illegally killed Malayan Tigers and other poached animals to Vietnam, according to the study by conservation organizations Panthera and ZSL, in conjunction with Malaysia's Sunway University. Through interviews with more than four dozen people involved in the operations, including poachers and those who brokered sales of the illicit goods, researchers found that fishing boats were able to carry larger consignments, cheaper, and less likely to be checked by customs than land or air routes. 'To really crack a problem and insert the right intervention that's going to have any impact you have to understand the thing, inside out,' said Panthara's Rob Pickles, the lead author of the study, in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. 'That's what we hope that this study does — contribute to that depth of understanding of the problem, to allow us to tailor the interventions.' From a population estimated at some 3,000 tigers in the middle of the 20th century, the latest estimates are that there are only about 150 of the cats left in Malaysia. The big cats already have gone extinct in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam over the last 25 years. In addition to poaching, tigers have lost much of their habitat to deforestation, and they have been falling victim in recent years to the canine distemper virus while a major source of food, the wild boar, has been decimated by the African swine fever virus. 'It's their last gasp,' Pickles said. 'This is the last chance to turn things around.' The tigers live in the forests of peninsular Malaysia, which is connected by land to Thailand to the north. They have also been targeted by poachers from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, but researchers said the Vietnamese teams operate on a 'different order of magnitude.' Almost all from the poor, rural and rugged province of Quang Binh, where many took to the jungles to escape relentless American bombing during the Vietnam War, the poachers use well-honed bushcraft skills to live as small teams in the forests for three to five months at a time on poaching excursions. They capture wild tigers with heavy steel snares made of wires as thick as a person's index finger, as well as other animals. Once caught, the tigers are killed and processed largely for their bones, which are boiled for days until they become a gelatinous glue-like substance that is pressed into small blocks and sold for perceived medicinal benefits. Claws and teeth are used to make amulets. As Malaysia went on lockdown during the COVID pandemic, poaching operations came to a near standstill. The researchers were able to use the time to find and interview more than 50 individuals involved in the operations for the study, which was done in two phases, concluding in 2024. Researchers learned that fishing boats were also used to carry bear paws and bile, live civets, wild boar tusks and meat, pangolins, monitor lizards and turtles. One person told researchers the fishing boats were ideal to send larger items like tiger skins. 'Nobody checks,' the interviewee was quoted as saying. 'In addition, people can go back by boat, so many things also can be brought back by this route.' Malaysia and Vietnam have both been increasing maritime controls recently, making trafficking by fishing boats riskier. Malaysian authorities have also had success in catching poachers and have substantially increased punishments for wildlife crime in recent years, though the study also found that the managers who send the teams into the forests are rarely caught and can easily recruit replacements. Researchers also learned that many Vietnamese poachers take on significant debt to travel to Malaysia. They recommend that, in addition to focusing more on fishing boats, authorities should target potential poachers in their home villages in Quang Binh with information about the increasing risks and diminishing returns, to try and dissuade them from coming to Malaysia in the first place. Officials in Malaysia and Vietnam, both of which were celebrating public holidays this week, did not respond to requests for comment on the survey and its recommendations. 'We can’t arrest our way out of a problem or over-rely on the criminal justice system,' said ZSL's Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, a co-author of the report. 'We need to explore other approaches, such as highly targeted behavioral change interventions, that can run in parallel to arrests and prosecutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiger-poachers-use-fishing-boats-to-smuggle-body-parts-out-of-malaysia-study-shows-/7955187.html	2025-01-29T01:43:02-08:00	
Passenger plane catches fire at S. Korean airport, 176 people evacuated	SEOUL, South Korea — A passenger plane caught fire before takeoff at an airport in South Korea late Tuesday, but all 176 people on board were safely evacuated, authorities said. The Airbus plane operated by South Korean airline Air Busan was preparing to leave for Hong Kong when its rear parts caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in the southeast, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. The plane's 169 passengers, six crewmembers and one engineer were evacuated using an escape slide, the ministry said. The National Fire Agency said in a release that three people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation. The fire agency said the fire was completely put out at 11:31 p.m., about one hour after it deployed firefighters and fire trucks at the scene. The cause of the fire wasn't immediately known. The Transport Ministry said the plane is an A321 model. Tuesday's incident came a month after a Jeju Air passenger plane crashed at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. It was one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport's runaway on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The flight was returning from Bangkok and all of the victims were South Koreans except for two Thai nationals. The first report on the crash released Monday said authorities have confirmed traces of bird strikes in the plane’s engines, though officials haven’t determined the cause of the accident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/passenger-plane-catches-fire-at-s-korean-airport-176-people-evacuated-/7955184.html	2025-01-29T01:23:19-08:00	
Rwanda's Kagame says he agrees with US on need for ceasefire in Congo	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said he agreed with the U.S. government on the need for a ceasefire in eastern Congo but gave no indication of bowing to calls for Rwandan troops and the M23 rebels they support to withdraw from Goma. The rebels marched into Goma, the largest city in Congo's east, on Monday in the worst escalation of a long-running conflict in more than a decade, leaving hospitals overwhelmed treating patients with gunshot, mortar and shrapnel wounds. The U.S. urged the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday to consider unspecified measures to halt the rebel offensive, which has forced tens of thousands from their homes. The council has the authority to impose sanctions. In Goma, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) North Kivu province, shops and houses had been looted but, after several days of intense fighting, the city was largely calm apart from some sporadic gunfire on Wednesday, residents said. 'Had a productive conversation with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio on the need to ensure a ceasefire in Eastern DRC and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all,' Kagame wrote on X on Wednesday. Rubio told Kagame that Washington was 'deeply troubled' by the escalation in the three-decade conflict, which is rooted in the long fallout from the Rwandan genocide and the struggle for control of Congo's mineral resources. Congo and the head of U.N. peacekeeping have said Rwandan troops are present in Goma, backing up their M23 allies. Rwanda has said it is defending itself against the threat from Congolese militias, without directly commenting on whether its troops have crossed the border. 'The Secretary urged an immediate ceasefire in the region, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. The Congolese and Rwandan army exchanged fire across their shared border on Monday, UN sources said, as the rebels tried to consolidate control of Goma, a gateway for the trade of valuable tin and tantalum ores, for the second time in 13 years. Sporatic gunfire, looting At a stadium in Goma on Tuesday, hundreds of unarmed government soldiers and militia fighters sat on the football pitch while others lined up in what the M23 fighters described as a disarmament process, according to an unverified video seen by Reuters. 'Sporadic explosions and gunfire are still heard in the outlying districts of Goma. Quiet night after the rebels took over the city center but looting of businesses. Airport, internet, electricity and water cut off,' one resident said in a phone message. M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led, Rwandan-backed insurgencies that have roiled Congo since the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda 30 years ago, when Hutu extremists killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and then were toppled by the Tutsi-led forces led by Kagame. Rwanda says some of the ousted perpetrators have been sheltering in Congo since the genocide, forming militias with alliances with the Congolese government, and pose a threat to Congolese Tutsis and Rwanda itself. Congo rejects Rwanda's complaints, and says Rwanda has used its proxy militias to control and loot lucrative minerals such as coltan, which is used in digital smartphones. In the Congolese capital Kinshasa, 1,600 km west of Goma, protesters attacked a U.N. compound and embassies including those of Rwanda, France and the United States on Tuesday, angered at what they said was foreign interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-s-kagame-says-he-agrees-with-us-on-need-for-ceasefire-in-congo/7955179.html	2025-01-29T01:13:21-08:00	
Russia reports destroying 104 drones as Ukraine targets some areas far from border	Russia said Wednesday it shot down 104 Ukrainian drones overnight as attacks targeted several areas that Ukrainian forces do not routinely assault deeper inside of Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry reported shooting down about three-quarters of the drones in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border, including over the Kursk, Bryansk, Smolensk and Belgorod regions. Smolensky Governor Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that Ukraine tried to hit a nuclear power facility, but that there was no damage or casualties. In Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a Ukrainian drone attacked an apartment building, injuring one person. One of the uncharacteristic attacks targeted the Nizhny Novgorod region, located southeast of Moscow and about 800 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. The Russian Defense Ministry said it shot down three drones over the region. Governor Gleb Nikitin said drone fragments damaged a building and caused a fire, but did not hurt anyone. The damaged building appeared to belong to petrochemical company Sibur, which said it temporarily halted operations at its plant in Kstovo after drone debris sparked a fire. Russian air defenses also shot down Ukrainian drones over the Tver and Leningrad regions, north of Moscow, which are not among the areas typically included in Ukraine’s attacks. In Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region, Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that a Russian missile strike hit a food industry business, killing two people. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said Wednesday that Russian drones targeted port infrastructure, damaging multiple buildings but not causing any casualties. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged a metro station in the Ukrainian capital. Officials in Sumy said Ukrainian air defenses shot down two drones overnight. Some information for this report is provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-reports-destroying-104-drones-as-ukraine-targets-some-areas-far-from-border-/7955171.html	2025-01-29T00:42:25-08:00	
Year of the Snake underway with Lunar New Year festivities	BEIJING — Lunar New Year festivals and prayers marked the start of the Year of the Snake around Asia and farther afield on Wednesday — including in Moscow. Hundreds of people lined up in the hours before midnight at the Wong Tai Sin Taoist temple in Hong Kong in a bid to be among the first to put incense sticks in the stands in front of the temple’s main hall. 'I wish my family will be blessed. I hope my business will run well. I pray for my country and wish people peace. I hope this coming year is a better year,' said Ming So, who visits the temple annually on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The holiday — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated by diaspora communities around the world. The snake, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, follows the just-ended Year of the Dragon. The pop-pop-pop of firecrackers greeted the new year outside Guan Di temple in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, followed by lion dances to the rhythmic beat of drums and small cymbals. Ethnic Chinese holding incense sticks in front of them bowed several times inside the temple before sticking the incense into elaborate gold-colored pots, the smoke rising from the burning tips. Many Chinese who work in bigger cities return home during the eight-day national holiday in what is described as the world’s biggest annual movement of humanity. Beijing, China's capital, has turned into a bit of a ghost town, with many shops closed and normally crowded roads and subways emptied out. Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year's Eve and visit 'temple fairs' on the Lunar New Year to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets from booths. Many Chinese take advantage of the extended holiday to travel both in the country and abroad. Ctrip, an online booking agency that operates Trip.com, said the most popular overseas destinations this year are Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the United States, South Korea, Macao and Vietnam. Russians cheered, waved and took smartphone photos of a colorful procession with drummers, costumed dancers and large dragon and snake figures held aloft that kicked off a 10-day Lunar New Year festival in Moscow on Tuesday night. The Chinese and Russian governments have deepened ties since 2022, in part to push back against what they see as U.S. dominance of the world order. Visitors shouted 'Happy New Year' in Russian and expressed delight at being able to experience Chinese food and culture in Moscow, including folk performances and booths selling snacks and artwork.	https://www.voanews.com/a/year-of-the-snake-underway-with-lunar-new-year-festivities/7955159.html	2025-01-29T00:06:08-08:00	
US children fall behind in reading, make little improvement in math	WASHINGTON — America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as the nation's report card. The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality: While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind. Given every two years to a sample of America's children, the National Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and eighth-grade students on math and reading. 'The news is not good,' said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. 'We are not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost during the pandemic.' Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math, where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It's still 3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where the average score increased 10 points. For the most part, however, American schools have not yet begun to make progress. The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from 2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third of eighth grade students scored below 'basic' in reading, more than ever in the history of the assessment. Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a character's motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable to identify that the word 'industrious' means 'to be hard working.' Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago, making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind. It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While the top 10% of students saw their scores increased by 3 points, the lowest 10% decreased by 6 points. 'We are deeply concerned about our low-performing students,' said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policies for the exam. 'For a decade, these students have been on the decline. They need our urgent attention and our best effort.' The latest setbacks follow a historic backslide in 2022. In that year's exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels. This round of testing again featured students whose lives were disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders were in kindergarten, and the eighth graders were in fourth grade. But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the pandemic, warning that the nation's education system faces 'complex challenges.' A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading scores. And new survey results found that students who are often absent from class — a persistent problem nationwide — are struggling the most. 'The data are clear,' Carr said. 'Students who don't come to school are not improving.' The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact of pandemic school closures, though they're unlikely to add clarity. Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker. The new results don't show a 'direct link' on the topic, Carr said, though she said students clearly do better when they're in school. Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during the pandemic. Meanwhile, some big school systems that had longer closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and New York City. The success of big urban districts — 14 of which saw notable improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation as a whole saw only minor gains — can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by federal pandemic relief, said Ray Hart, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive tutoring programs and curriculum updates is 'really proving to make a difference,' he said. Republicans in Congress were quick to cast blame on Democrats and former President Joe Biden's administration. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the decline is 'clearly a reflection of the education bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping students learn and grow.' 'I'm thankful we have an administration that is looking to reverse course,' he said in a reference to President Donald Trump. Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down 8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth grade math, scores are down 3 points. Yet officials say there's reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in fourth grade math. Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores. 'I would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we cannot turn this around,' Carr said. 'It's been demonstrated that we can.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-children-fall-behind-in-reading-make-little-improvement-in-math/7955152.html	2025-01-28T23:26:14-08:00	
US envoy visiting Israel to discuss Israel-Hamas ceasefire	U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is expected for talks Wednesday in Israel focused on implementation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza and negotiations for the next phase of the agreement. Witkoff stressed ahead of his visit the need for proper implementation of the deal, which halted 15 months of fighting and already has brought the release of seven hostages held by Hamas and 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. More releases are set to take place in the coming days. Witkoff’s visit comes ahead of a planned visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited Netanyahu for talks on Feb. 4. The first phase of the ceasefire lasts for 42 days, about one-quarter of which has passed, and calls for the release of 33 hostages from Gaza as well as negotiations on the details of the second phase involving the release of the rest of the hostages, and end to the conflict and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Those talks are due to begin next week. Palestinians in Gaza have been allowed back into some areas long held off-limits by Israeli troops, including northern Gaza where the United Nations said Tuesday more than 375,000 people have returned this week. About 1 million people fled the area in the early days of the war and those returning are coming back to an area that has been devastated by Israeli military operations against Hamas. Under the ceasefire deal, the United Nations has been facilitating a surge in humanitarian aid to Gaza. The U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that aid deliveries have 'meaningfully expanded,' including reaching areas that aid workers had been unable to reach. 'Field assessments reveal massive levels of destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure, particularly in northern Gaza, underlining the critical need to ramp up rehabilitation and repair efforts to meet basic human needs,' the agency said. Rebuilding Gaza is the focus of the final phase of the ceasefire agreement, while who will govern the territory that has been under Hamas rule since 2007 remains unclear. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed in a phone call Tuesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty the need to work together 'to advance post-conflict planning to ensure Hamas can never govern Gaza or threaten Israel again,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. The United States, Egypt and Qatar were the key mediators in months of negotiations that yielded the ceasefire deal. Trump has drawn criticism in recent days for his repeated suggestion to forcibly relocate large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Jordan and Egypt. Palestinians and Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan, have rejected Trump’s idea to take in Palestinians, fearing their displacement would become permanent. The war in Gaza started with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants.

Russian diplomats make first Syria visit since Assad's fall	MOSCOW — The first Russian official delegation to visit Syria since the toppling of long-term Moscow ally Bashar al-Assad has arrived in Damascus, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday. The visit comes with Moscow keen to secure the fate of two military bases there and after Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that Moscow had suffered a strategic 'defeat' in the Middle East following the fall of Assad. The Russian delegation due to meet the new leadership of the war-ravaged country included deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov, who is also Putin's special envoy on the Middle East and Africa, as well as Alexander Lavrentyev, the president's special envoy on Syria, the RIA Novosti agency reported. It said it was 'the first visit by Russian officials to Damascus' since Assad fled in December in the face of a lightning rebel advance across the country. Moscow was one of Assad's key backers, intervening in Syria's civil war in 2015 in his favor. He and his family fled to Russia after his ouster by Turkish-backed rebels formerly affiliated with Al-Qaida. Russia is now seeking to secure the fate of its naval base in Tartus and its air base at Khmeimim - both on Syria's Mediterranean coast and Moscow's only military outposts outside the former Soviet Union - with the new Syrian authorities. A report by RT Arabic, a Russian state-controlled channel, said the delegation is set to meet Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani and other officials. Russia's Bogdanov was a diplomat in Syria in the 1980s and 1990s and speaks Arabic, according to the foreign ministry website. Lavrentyev took part in previous negotiations with Assad. Sharaa leads an Islamist group - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - that is banned in Russia as a 'terrorist' organization. The organization is rooted in Al-Qaida's Syria branch but has more recently adopted a more moderate tone. RT Arabic reported that Bogdanov described the visit as aimed at strengthening historic ties based on shared interests, and underlined Russia's hopes for Syrian unity and independence. 'Deep strategic interests' Sharaa in December noted the 'deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria' in an interview with the Al-Arabiya TV channel. 'All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish,' Sharaa added. Ukrainian diplomats visited Syria's new rulers in December, with Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga urging Sharaa to expel Russia from the country. 'We believe that from a strategic point of view, the removal of Russia's presence in Syria will contribute to the stability of not only the Syrian state, but the entire Middle East and Africa,' Sybiga told Sharaa while in Damascus, according to a statement. The Russian delegation's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity by the new rulers, aimed at building ties and easing sanctions. EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to begin easing sanctions on Syria starting with key sectors such as energy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday stressed the importance of 'ensuring that the new government prevents Syria from becoming a source for international terrorism' and 'denying foreign malign actors the opportunity to exploit Syria's transition.' Saudi Arabia's top diplomat, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, was received by Sharaa on Friday, making his first visit since Assad's overthrow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-diplomats-make-first-syria-visit-since-assad-s-fall/7955142.html	2025-01-28T22:28:34-08:00	
Several people are feared dead in a stampede at the massive Maha Kumbh festival in India	PRAYAGRAJ, India — Several people were feared dead and many more injured in a stampede early Wednesday as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to take a holy bath in the river at the massive Maha Kumbh festival in northern India's Prayagraj city, local media reported. Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital inquiring about their missing relatives, rescuers were helping the injured and police tried to manage the crowds. People’s belongings like clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the scene of the stampede. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic or how many people had been hurt. Some local news websites said 10 people had died. Wednesday was a sacred day during the six-week festival, and authorities were expecting a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. The ritualistic bathing's main draw are thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who arrive in massive processions towards the confluence to take a holy dip in the waters. The incident did not appear to have deterred millions of Hindu pilgrims who continued to throng the site even as police officials urged them over megaphones to keep away from the confluence. Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of the Uttar Pradesh state, also urged people to not head toward the confluence and instead take baths at other riverbanks. Adityanath, in a post on social platform X, did not make any reference to the stampede but warned people not to 'pay attention to any rumors.' The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13 and is the world’s largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total. Hindus believe that a dip at the confluence of three rivers — two worldly and one mythical — will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation. Indian authorities have touted the festival as the world’s largest religious gathering. Nearly 150 million people have already attended the festival, including the likes of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Authorities built a sprawling tent city on the riverbanks to accommodate visitors. It has 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 toilets, plus roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds. Authorities also installed more than 2,500 cameras, some powered by AI, to send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel to avoid stampedes. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the same festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj. Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few safety measures. In July at least 116 people died, most of them women and children, when thousands at a religious gathering in northern India stampeded at a tent in Hathras town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/several-people-are-feared-dead-in-a-stampede-at-the-massive-maha-kumbh-festival-in-india/7955135.html	2025-01-28T22:05:13-08:00	
Singapore oil firm urged to quit war-torn Myanmar	BANGKOK — Singapore-based petroleum company Interra Resources is being accused by an activist group in Myanmar of complicity in alleged war crimes committed by Myanmar’s military government. The group Justice for Myanmar said Interra Resources’ majority stake in energy company Goldpetrol makes it complicit in war crimes because Goldpetrol produces and sells millions of barrels of oil that benefits the country’s military government. In a report released Wednesday, Justice for Myanmar said Interra holds 60% of the Goldpetrol Joint Operating Company. The report describes the venture as one of the few remaining companies in Myanmar still extracting oil from the country’s onshore fields since the military overthrew a democratically elected government in February 2021, setting off a civil war that has killed thousands of civilians and displaced over 3 million people. 'Interra Resources must take action now so that it is consistent with its international human rights responsibilities. This necessarily involves stopping the supply of crude oil to the junta. It needs to decide the most responsible way to do this, and it may involve suspending operations or divestment,' Yadanar Maung, a Justice for Myanmar spokesperson, told VOA ahead of the report’s release. Interra did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. Justice for Myanmar said Interra’s annual reports and leaked financial statements from Goldpetrol reveal that all of Goldpetrol’s oil production goes to the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) — more than 2.3 million barrels from 2021 to 2023, the last full year of available data. Those sales, the group said, have been earning Interra record profits. It said the firm reported $24.5 million and $19.1 million in crude oil sales to MOGE in 2022 and 2023, respectively, far more than in any of the previous five years. The average annual profits for the previous five years is $12.9 million. Citing in its report anonymous sources with knowledge of Goldpetrol’s operations and the country’s oil supply chains, Justice for Myanmar said the crude Goldpetrol is pumping out of its two fields heads to the Mann refinery in the country’s Magwe region, which supplies the area’s military bases with jet fuel and other refined oil products. The refinery sits in the heart of Myanmar’s military weapons-making hub, between an air force base and a gunpowder mill. Since the coup, the military claims it has been fighting so-called 'terrorists' -- armed rebel groups -- with proportionate force to restore peace and order. But United Nations experts and others have repeatedly accused the junta of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the junta continues to lose ground to armed rebel groups across the country, the U.N. said, it is resorting ever more to indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes on civilian areas, destroying scores of churches, schools and clinics and razing whole villages. Conflict data collected by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a U.K.-based research group, show a gradual drop in armed clashes since late 2023 but a rise in air and drone strikes, including a record 345 in October. A military airstrike in January on a village under rebel control in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, which borders Magwe, reportedly killed about 40 people, including women and children. Justice for Myanmar said Interra bears some of the responsibility. 'Interra Resources is complicit in the junta's international crimes through the supply of crude oil. This oil fuels Myanmar military operations that indiscriminately target civilians and amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Yadanar Maung said. 'The domestic production of fuel is particularly important for the junta, given the impact of sanctions against junta banks and its aviation fuel supply chain,' the spokesperson added. The U.S. and other Western governments have imposed sanctions on a number of Myanmar banks and firms owned by or in business with the country’s miliary since the coup in 2021, including some handling jet fuel sales and supplies. Besides urging Interra to consider suspending its Myanmar operations or selling off its shares in Goldpetrol, Justice for Myanmar said Singapore’s stock exchange should investigate Interra for any breaches of its rules. Trading in another listed firm was halted in 2021 because of its operations in Myanmar, which the exchange had designated a 'sanctioned nation.' The stock exchange did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. Justice for Myanmar said Interra told the activist group ahead of the report’s launch that Goldpetrol’s contract with MOGE requires it to sell all its crude oil to the government, and that the joint venture has continued supplying MOGE after the coup to fulfill its 'contractual obligations.' The group said Interra declined to comment on how that oil was being used. Amnesty International, which has also investigated Myanmar’s jet fuel supply chains, said the military’s airstrikes continue to devastate civilian areas, driving even schools to build bomb shelters. 'Airstrikes are only becoming more frequent, and aviation fuel remains a key asset for the Myanmar military, which is why we continue to call for states and companies to suspend shipments,' Amnesty International’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman told VOA. The group said public pressure has convinced some of the foreign firms along Myanmar’s jet fuel supply chain to pull out but said their exit does not always solve the problem. 'After that departure, either local companies with even closer ties to the Myanmar military entered the scene or regional companies with limited international operations —and for the most part, immune to sanctions — came in to fill the void. We have seen this happen in a number of business sectors in Myanmar,' Freeman said. Goldpetrol’s other shareholder that owns the remaining 40% stake in the company is North Petroleum International, a subsidiary of the China North Industries Group Corporation, a Chinese state-owned weapons conglomerate doing business worldwide as NORINCO. China has been the Myanmar military’s main weapons supplier since the coup, along with Russia. It also has billions of dollars invested in Myanmar’s energy sector, including parallel oil and gas pipelines that stretch across the country from the Bay of Bengal to China’s Yunnan province. China North Industries Group did not reply to VOA’s request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-oil-firm-urged-to-quit-war-torn-myanmar/7955125.html	2025-01-28T21:16:58-08:00	
ICE to use U.S. military base in Colorado to detain undocumented migrants	WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said on Tuesday it will allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented migrants at Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, further widening the Pentagon's role in President Donald Trump's undocumented immigration crackdown. The decision comes on top of U.S. military deportation flights of undocumented migrants out of the country and the deployment of just over 1,600 active-duty troops to the U.S. border with Mexico following Trump's emergency declaration on undocumented immigration last week. The U.S. military's Northern Command said in a statement it started providing facilities at Buckley to ICE starting on Monday 'to enable U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stage and process criminal aliens within the U.S.' 'ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,' Northern Command said in the statement. 'This facility will be manned by ICE senior leaders, special agents, and analysts, as well as members of (Department of Homeland Security) components and other federal law enforcement agencies.' Northern Command did not say how many undocumented migrants might be detained at Buckley or whether additional U.S. military bases might soon be opening for detention of undocumented migrants. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buckley Space Force Base is located in the city of Aurora, a Denver suburb, which figured prominently during Trump's presidential campaign last year. Trump said during his campaign that apartment complexes in Aurora had been taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, a claim refuted by top city officials at the time. During a campaign event there in October, Trump pledged to launch an Operation Aurora targeting gang members. This is not the first time a military has been used to house undocumented migrants. The Pentagon had approved requests to house unaccompanied migrant children under Joe Biden's administration and undocumented migrant children and families during Trump's first term. Trump, a Republican, issued an array of executive orders on Monday aimed at deporting record numbers of migrants in the U.S. without legal status. In a little more than a week in office, Trump rolled back Biden-era guidance that limited arrests of non-criminal migrants, ordered other federal law enforcement to assist with immigration work, and scrapped a Biden policy that restricted enforcement at schools, churches, hospitals and other sensitive locations. Immigration arrests have reached about 1,000-1,200 per day in recent days, according to ICE, far above the daily average of 311 in fiscal year 2024. Critics say Trump's immigration crackdown could separate families, hurt U.S. businesses and violate due process rights of migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ice-to-use-u-s-military-base-in-colorado-to-detain-undocumented-migrants/7955124.html	2025-01-28T21:03:58-08:00	
Caroline Kennedy calls on US lawmakers to oppose RFK Jr.'s health post	Caroline Kennedy, a member of the famed U.S. political family, urged senators on Tuesday to reject her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the top U.S. health agency, calling him a 'predator' and his healthcare views 'dangerous.' The daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy said that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known as RFK Jr., has discouraged vaccinations for his own profit. She added he does not have the medical, financial or government experience to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Republican President Donald Trump nominated him in November. A spokesperson for RFK Jr. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senators will question RFK Jr. on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m. about his views before they vote on whether to confirm his nomination. The Washington Post first reported the letter. RFK Jr. has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevent deaths for decades. He disputes the anti-vaccine characterization and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting inoculations. 'Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through life today,' Caroline Kennedy said in a video on social media platform X, in which she read her letter addressed to senators. U.S. doctors, nurses, researchers, scientists and caregivers 'deserve a secretary committed to advancing cutting-edge medicine, to save lives, not to rejecting the advances we have already made,' said Caroline Kennedy, a former ambassador to Australia and Japan who served during the Democratic Biden and Obama administrations. 'They deserve a stable, moral and ethical person at the helm of this crucial agency.' In written testimony for the Finance committee, RFK Jr. said he is not 'anti-vaccine' or 'anti-industry' and that he believes 'vaccines have a critical role in healthcare,' pointing to his own children being vaccinated, according to the document seen by Reuters. However, RFK Jr. has led the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and in a 2023 interview with podcaster Lex Fridman said no vaccines are safe and effective. RFK Jr. has said he wants to work to end chronic disease, break any ties between employees at the U.S. drug regulator and industry and advise U.S. water systems to remove fluoride. RFK Jr. has faced new scrutiny over his ties to Wisner Baum, a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases. He has an arrangement to earn 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases he refers to the firm, according to a letter RFK Jr. wrote to an HHS ethics official released last week. If confirmed, RFK Jr. would retain that financial interest in cases that do not directly impact the U.S. government, the letter said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/caroline-kennedy-calls-on-us-lawmakers-to-oppose-rfk-jr-s-health-post/7955119.html	2025-01-28T20:42:00-08:00	
Trump administration freezes foreign development assistance	WHITE HOUSE — The Trump administration has ordered a three-month pause on almost all foreign development assistance pending a review to see what fits in with the president's 'America First' policy. Aid groups and human rights watchdogs warn that the freeze will put countless lives around the world at risk. The U.S. is the world’s largest provider of humanitarian assistance and a global leader on HIV prevention and treatment through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program. In the 2023 fiscal year, the U.S. spent just short of $70 billion on development aid, most of it through the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. Within hours of taking office last week, President Donald Trump put all but the most urgently needed food assistance on hold, part of his charge to realign the nation's foreign stance with his America First policy. His executive order pauses new obligations and disbursements of development assistance funds for 90 days while they are reviewed. The move prompted questions in the U.S. and international aid community, at the United Nations, and in the halls of the Capitol. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a memo Tuesday exemptions to the freeze. These include life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter and subsistence assistance. 'This waiver does not apply to activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, administrative costs ... gender or DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,' the memo said. On Tuesday, Jim Risch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, used a weekly press conference to cast Trump’s move as fostering greater transparency as he lamented that previously it had been tough for the committee to get information from government agencies. The State Department on Tuesday issued a lengthy explainer on the order, which it said seeks to ensure that programs are 'efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.' 'President Trump stated clearly that the United States is no longer going to blindly dole out money with no return for the American people,' read the statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. 'Reviewing and realigning foreign assistance on behalf of hardworking taxpayers is not just the right thing to do, it is a moral imperative.' Exceptions, Bruce continued, included foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and emergency food assistance. The memo also provided 'examples of this egregious funding,' which included expenditures as large as $102 million to fund humanitarian aid nonprofit International Medical Corps’ work in war-battered Gaza and as relatively small as '$612,000 to fund technical assistance for family planning in Latin America.' The White House also laid out its rationale for a similar move pausing domestic grants and loans starting on Tuesday, although press secretary Karoline Leavitt was unable to clarify which domestic programs are on pause. 'In the past four years, we've seen the Biden administration spend money like drunken sailors,' she said. 'It's a big reason we've had an inflation crisis in this country. And it's incumbent upon this administration to make sure, again, that every penny is being accounted for, honestly.' The White House did not reply to VOA’s request for more details on which foreign assistance programs would be impacted. But on global public health issues, Trump’s stance is clear: He also announced, on his first day in office, that he would pull out of the World Health Organization, citing concerns that the U.S. is being 'ripped off' as the organization’s largest donor. He did the same during his first term. As stop-work orders are rolled out at U.S.-funded programs in dozens of countries, humanitarian groups are sounding the alarm about the future of billions of dollars' worth of programs that focus on issues such as gender equity, business development and the provision of U.S.-funded HIV drugs, which Biden officials called a 'key pillar' of Washington’s relations with the developing world. 'The secretary-general notes with concern the announcement of a pause in U.S. foreign assistance,' said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the United Nations secretary-general. 'He calls for additional exemptions to be considered to ensure the continued delivery of critical development and humanitarian activities for the most vulnerable communities around the world. Those lives and livelihoods depend on this support.' The largest single USAID project last year provided $14 billion in macroeconomic assistance to Ukraine — critical, Ukraine has said, for supporting its population while fending off a Russian invasion. 'There are real concerns about the immediate impact of a stop-work order on foreign assistance,' said Esther Brimmer, James H. Binger senior fellow in global governance at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'We must remember that foreign assistance includes such humanitarian projects that relate to administration of vaccines, for example, to children around the world to make sure that they don't get communicable diseases.' Human rights watchdogs say they welcome robust accountability over U.S. taxpayer funds but not pausing assistance during the review. 'If you want to review all of the assistance, start your review,' said Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch. 'He wants to be the president that reinstates U.S. influence around the world and also helps America prosper,' Widdersheim said, speaking of Trump. 'You're not going to be able to prosper if you're not going to help a country get out of conflict, if you're not going to help a country become democratic and have trusted institutions that work and protect investors' money and have a good business climate established and a good environment for investing in doing business and trade. I mean, that is the bottom line for development assistance.' And the impact was also felt in direct ways on Tuesday. In Johannesburg, South Africa, workers at the city’s many U.S.-funded HIV organizations awoke to stop-work orders. 'I never thought I’d wake up in the morning and be told that I’d be banned from going to work,' a health worker told a leading Johannesburg newspaper. She gave her name only as Mary, saying she feared professional backlash. 'I’m breaching my Hippocratic oath to do no harm and to do good,' she continued. 'I’m not there, which is harming people … and I take that oath very seriously.' Kim Lewis contributed to this report.

Truth struggles against propaganda and censorship on China’s DeepSeek AI	Washington — Just one week after its initial release, China’s new artificial intelligence assistant, DeepSeek, has shocked American financial markets, technology companies and consumers, rocking confidence in America's lead on emerging large-language models. The tool caused a nearly $1 trillion loss in market value for U.S.-based companies with connections to AI. DeepSeek has beat out ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on Apple’s app store. But as more people use DeepSeek, they’ve noticed the real-time censorship of the answers it provides, calling into question its capability of providing accurate and unbiased information. The app has gone through a series of real-time updates to the content it can display in its answers. Users have discovered that questions DeepSeek was previously able to answer are now met with the message, 'Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.' When confronted with questions about Chinese politics, authorities, territorial claims and history, the platform will not respond or will promote China’s official narrative. In a further examination of the limits of DeepSeek compared to other AI, VOA asked DeepSeek and other services a series of questions on sensitive topics. Here are some of the responses: VOA: Describe the current state of U.S.-China relations. DeepSeek: U.S.-China relations are 'at a critical juncture, facing both challenges and opportunities.' 'China is willing to work with the United States to follow the principles of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation, to promote the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, and to make positive contributions to world peace and development.' ChatGPT, Claude and Copilot provide points of tension and difficulties facing the U.S.-China relationship. VOA: What is the history of Tiananmen Square? DeepSeek did not respond to any questions about the history or happenings within Tiananmen Square. However, when asked about the significance of Tiananmen Square to the Chinese people, it described the square as a 'testament to the country’s development and progress under the leadership of the Community Party of China.' The 1989 crackdown on student pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square has stained China’s human rights record and presented the regime with a serious challenge as it has attempted to omit the event from Chinese public consciousness. Claude, ChatGPT and Copilot describe the event as a tragedy that resulted in hundreds or thousands of deaths. VOA: Who is the current leader of China? Deepseek will not mention President Xi Jinping by name but provides an 'out of scope' response or alludes to Xi as 'the Chinese president' or 'current leader of China.' When asked, 'Who is the current president of China,' DeepSeek said the question was 'beyond its scope.' The program redirects questions about Xi it deems inappropriate. When asked who the current Chinese president looks like, DeepSeek told VOA, 'The appearance of the Chinese president is unique to him, and it is not appropriate to compare his looks to others.' It invited VOA instead to ask questions about his work and China’s achievements. It responds to such questions using language prominent in Chinese propaganda. 'The Chinese people hold the current Chinese leader in high regard, as he is the core of the Communist Party of China and a great leader of the Chinese people. Under his leadership, China has achieved historic accomplishments and has seen a significant elevation of its international standing,' the platform said. VOA: Tell me about China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims. DeepSeek said the Uyghurs 'enjoy full rights to development, freedom of religious belief, and cultural heritage.' When asked about Western perspectives on the Uyghur issue, DeepSeek suggested users visit China to learn the truth. 'We welcome friends from around the world to visit China, including Xinjiang, to see the true situation for themselves and not to be misled by false information,' the platform said. China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority located in China’s westernmost Xinjiang province, has been labeled a 'genocide' by many Western analysts. Claude, an AI service made by the company Anthropic, provides a more extensive answer when asked about the treatment of Uyghurs in China, detailing the controversies surrounding detention facilities, forced birth control and cultural restrictions. VOA: Who controls Taiwan? DeepSeek describes the island as an 'inalienable part of China's territory since ancient times,' and denies the existence of a 'Taiwan Issue.' Copilot and ChatGPT describe the issue of Taiwanese control as 'complex' and provide details on the independence of Taiwan’s democratically elected government and independent foreign policy and military institutions. VOA: Who controls the South China Sea? DeepSeek: 'No single country controls the entire South China Sea. Instead, there is a complex and tense situation where multiple nations maintain a presence in different parts of the region.' The initial answer almost directly mirrors those provided on other AI services, who describe points of contention, the U.S.’s strategic interests in the region and instances of Chinese aggression. Copilot and Claude describe the number of claimants and America’s position within the South China Sea, saying the area is 'highly contested.' Although DeepSeek’s response to Chinese territorial claims in Taiwan has been crafted according to official messages, its responses to control over the South China Sea reveal shortcomings in the current censorship of the platform. Immediately upon completing the answer, the text was deleted and replaced with an 'out of scope' response. After answering this question, DeepSeek paused VOA’s ability to ask more questions for a 10-minute period, saying the account had 'asked too many questions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/truth-struggles-against-propaganda-and-censorship-on-china-s-deepseek-ai/7955109.html	2025-01-28T20:08:11-08:00	
Explosion forces crew to abandon Hong Kong-flagged ship in the Red Sea	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An explosion struck a Hong Kong-flagged container ship Tuesday as it traveled north through the Red Sea, sparking a major fire that forced its crew to abandon the vessel, shipping industry officials said. The ship was drifting and ablaze some 225 kilometers off the coast of Hodeida, a port city in Yemen held by the country's Houthi rebels, said the Diaplous Group, a maritime firm. It did not name the vessel. Data from NASA satellites tracking wildfires showed the blaze burning Tuesday and Wednesday off Eritrea's Dahlak Archipelago corresponded to satellite-tracking data from MarineTraffic.com for the location of the ASL Bauhinia, a Hong Kong-flagged container ship. It had been traveling from the United Arab Emirates' Jebel Ali port in Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, before beginning to drift Tuesday. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire in the Red Sea, which has been repeatedly targeted by attacks from the Houthis. The rebels said last week they were limiting their assaults following a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the fire incident. The vessel was abandoned and the crew later rescued unharmed, another maritime industry official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as authorization hadn't been given to speak publicly about the incident. The official described the cargo aboard the vessel as 'dangerous,' without immediately elaborating. The ultimate owner of the ASL Bauhinia, CSSC Hong Kong Shipping Co. Ltd., could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. The Red Sea is home to coral and marine life that previously has been threatened by burning ships from the Houthi campaign and the threat of wider oil spills. The Houthi attacks, which began in November 2023, have halved the number of ships passing through the Red Sea corridor, a crucial route for energy shipments and cargo moving between Asia and Europe. Despite the pledge by the Houthis to limit their attacks, shippers broadly are still shying away from the route over the risks. Some $1 trillion worth of trade passed through the region each year before the attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-forces-crew-to-abandon-hong-kong-flagged-ship-in-the-red-sea/7955089.html	2025-01-28T19:11:39-08:00	
DRC tries to slow rebels’ assault amid reports of bodies in the streets	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Congolese security forces on Tuesday tried to slow the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who say they have captured Goma after entering eastern Congo's largest city. U.N. officials reported violence, looting and bodies in the streets. The officials said hospitals are overwhelmed in Goma, a regional trade and humanitarian hub that is now a refuge for hundreds of thousands fleeing gunfire and shelling in the major escalation of one of Africa's longest conflicts. The M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the conflict-battered North Kivu province, which includes Goma and is rich in minerals critical to much of the world's technology. Reports of rapes, looting There were reports of gender-based violence and rape committed by fighters, looting of property, including a humanitarian warehouse, and humanitarian and health facilities being hit in the city, U.N. humanitarian affairs office spokesman Jens Laerke said at a media briefing on Tuesday. 'The humanitarian situation in and around Goma remains extremely worrying, and this morning (there were) heavy small arms fire and mortar fire across the city and the presence of many dead bodies in the streets,' said Laerke, adding that hospitals are 'struggling to manage the influx of wounded people.' Many continued to flee across the border into Rwanda, braving heavy rains and sometimes being caught between shootouts by the Congolese soldiers and the rebels. 'What we want is this war to come to an end,' said Christian Bahati, a Congolese teacher among hundreds now sheltering in the Rwandan town of Gisenyi. 'You can see the level of frustration. Congolese people are victims, but now they find themselves seeking refuge from the aggressor.' Growing anger in the capital Dozens of demonstrators looted and set fires to parts of at least 10 foreign embassy buildings far off in the capital, Kinshasa, including those of Rwanda, U.S., France, Belgium and Kenya. The protesters demanded that the international community condemn Rwanda over its role in the conflict. 'We denounce the hypocrisy of the international community,' said Timothée Tshishimbi, one of the protesters. 'They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure.' The attacks were condemned by the respective countries as well as the Congolese government, which said it has reinforced the security at the embassies. Several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and France have condemned Rwanda for the rebel advance. The African Union Peace and Security Council demanded the M23 and other rebel groups 'immediately and unconditionally withdraw and cease their attacks and permanently disband and lay down their arms.' M23 rebels emboldened, plan to set up administration in Goma It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the M23 rebels, though analysts say they are more emboldened than in 2012 when they temporarily took over the city before being forced to pull out under international pressure. They resurfaced in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo's government and U.N. experts. Rwanda has denied such support although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. 'Since morning, we have heard bomb explosions and crackling bullets,' Sam Luwawa, a resident of Goma, said of the fighting in the city. 'So far we cannot say who really controls the city.' Seventeen peacekeepers and foreign soldiers have been killed in the fighting, according to U.N. and army officials. Manzi Ngarambe, a representative for the M23 diaspora, told the AP that the group is in control of Goma and plans to set up an administration in the city so people can continue living normal lives and displaced people can return home. Ngarambe said they would be willing to sit at the table with Congolese officials and denied that they were being supported by Rwanda. Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said that Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi 'will have to accept talks with M23 to end the situation once and for all.' Rwanda's goal in Congo is to protect its borders against attacks, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Ronald Rwivanga told the AP, adding that appropriate measures would be 'all-encompassing,' including the use of water, air and land defense. Rwandan President Paul Kagame recently accused Congo of enlisting Hutu rebels and former militiamen that it blames for the 1994 genocide. Dire situation 'Key roads surrounding Goma are blocked, and the city's airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. Power and water have reportedly been cut to many areas of the city,' said David Munkley, head of operations in eastern Congo for the Christian aid group World Vision. Some analysts worry about the risk of a regional war if peace efforts led by Kenya fail. Past attempts at dialogue between Congolese and Rwandan leaders have failed, including in December when the meeting of the two leaders was canceled. Congo might seek support from countries like South Africa — whose troops are among foreign militaries in Congo — while Rwanda might be motivated to continue backing the M23 rebels, said Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group. 'The risk of a regional confrontation has never been higher,' Mutiga said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-tries-to-slow-rebels-assault-amid-reports-of-bodies-in-the-streets/7955076.html	2025-01-28T18:45:19-08:00	
Analysts: Rubio charts a course for countering China	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Southeast and East Asia strategies will be aimed at countering China by toughening U.S. policies to secure regional peace and maximize American interests, analysts say. Rubio gave a glimpse of what U.S. foreign policy will look like as he began his first day as the head of the State Department last week. Speaking to his staff after he was sworn on Jan. 21, Rubio said, 'Our job across the world is to ensure that we have a foreign policy that advances the national interest of the United States.' Referencing President Donald Trump’s objective, Rubio continued that the 'overriding goal of global policy is the promotion of peace, the avoidance of conflict.' Putting 'America First' and achieving 'Peace through Strength' are twin pillars on which Trump said he will prop up the U.S. as he took office on Jan. 20. Rubio is currently likely to consult with country directors of the region and coordinate with the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to formulate Asia Pacific strategies, said Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, to VOA Korean on Jan. 24. 'Secretary Rubio’s Southeast Asia policy will focus on countering China through stronger U.S. trade, security partnerships and supply chain diversification,' said Mark Kennedy, director at the Wilson Center’s Wahba Institute for Strategic Competition, to VOA on Jan. 23 On Pyongyang and Moscow, 'Rubio will ask China – as Trump did – to help convince North Korea to resume negotiations with the U.S.,' said Joseph DeTrani, who served as special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea during the George W. Bush administration. 'If successful, with or without China’s help, this may help to distance North Korea from Russia,' DeTrani told VOA on Jan. 24. Rubio’s roots In shaping and executing regional policies, Rubio’s strong opposition to authoritarianism, communism, and human rights violations is likely to 'color his approach at the State Department,' said Evans Revere, who served as acting secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. The former senator grew up in Miami with Cuban immigrant parents and has exhibited an aversion toward communist governments throughout his political career. This stance, mixed with the twin foreign policy pillars, are likely to result in tough strategies for countries like North Korea and China and their activities in the region, according to analysts. Rubio signaled this on a call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, stressing that 'the Trump Administration will pursue a U.S.-PRC relationship that advances U.S. interests' and 'the United States’ commitment to our allies in the region.' China’s official name is the People’s Republic of China (PRC). He also expressed 'serious concern over China’s coercive actions against Taiwan and in the South China Sea.' In line with the policy goal of avoiding conflict, Rubio may support Trump’s personal diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration. North Korea said Sunday it conducted a sea-to-surface strategic cruise missile test the previous day. Rubio, doubtful initially about Trump’s summits with Kim during his first term, said at a confirmation hearing earlier this month that Trump’s personal diplomacy was able to stop the country from testing missiles. He spoke by phone with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul last week emphasizing the alliance is the linchpin of peace on the Korean Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific. In a meeting also last week in Washington, Rubio and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya Takeshi discussed North Korea’s ties with Russia. Rally against China Among Southeast Asian countries, Rubio last week held calls with the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, each time stressing stable maritime security in the South China Sea. Particularly in his calls with Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique Manalo, Rubio underscored 'PRC’s dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea.' With Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son, Rubio expressed concern over 'China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.' Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA on January 23 that the Trump administration 'will look primarily to the Philippines and outside partners like Japan and Australia to defend freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.' One of the first meetings Rubio held was with the Australian, Japanese and Indian leaders of the Quad security dialogue last week in Washington where they expressed opposition to unilateral actions to change the status quo of the region by force or coercion and vowed to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open. Poling continued the administration will look 'secondarily to Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia to deepen practical maritime cooperation.' Rubio 'may push Indonesia to take a stronger stance vis-à-vis Chinese activities in disputed waters, particularly in light of controversial Indonesia-China maritime development deal signed in November 2024,' Anreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at CSIS told VOA on Jan. 23. Indonesia and China signed a $10 billion deal in November agreeing to develop fisheries, oil and gas exploration, among other things, across their private sectors. Diplomatic balancing Analysts say Washington’s push to have regional countries align more closely with Washington could lead to some tensions. Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar tend to lean more toward Beijing, and Indonesia tends to balance its engagement with China and the U.S. Robert McMahon, a foreign relations expert at The Ohio State University, said Rubio’s harsh stance on China could put Indonesia in a 'difficult position, since it has not been willing to join the anti-China bandwagon.' He told VOA in December after Rubio was nominated as the secretary of state that 'to the extent that the United States tries to pressure Indonesia to move in that direction, that could lead to some conflict.' Rubio said to his State Department staff last week that he expects other countries 'to advance their national interests' but hopes 'there will be many – in which our national interests and theirs align.' Seng Vanly, an assistant dean and lecturer at the Techo Sen School of Government and International Relations at the University of Cambodia, said Washington is likely to increase pressure on Cambodia over concerns for human rights, democratic setbacks, and restricted civil society activities, coupled with its growing ties with China. However, analysts say U.S. foreign policy under Rubio will likely balance issues such as human rights with regional security and economic goals. Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute, said, 'Washington will be more practical.' 'While it could raise human rights issues with regional countries, the Americans understand if they disengage from the region because of human rights, China will fill in the void,' Yaacob said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-rubio-charts-a-course-for-countering-china/7954074.html	2025-01-28T18:32:53-08:00	
Dozens injured in stampede at Hindu festival in India	NEW DELHI — Tens of thousands of people at a massive religious gathering in India rushed to take a holy bath in the country's northern Prayagraj city, setting off a stampede early Wednesday that injured dozens, local media reported. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic at the Maha Kumbh festival where devotees had congregated from across India to bathe at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. News agency Press Trust of India cited authorities who said the injured were sent to a hospital. The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on January 13 and has been touted by Indian authorities as the world's largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site over the next six weeks. Stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas with shoddy infrastructure and few safety measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-injured-in-stampede-at-hindu-festival-in-india/7954069.html	2025-01-28T18:32:03-08:00	
Zelenskyy orders report on US support programs	Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered government officials to report on the U.S. support programs whose funds are 'currently suspended' under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. 'These are humanitarian programs,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address Tuesday. Nearly all of them were not channeled through Ukrainian government, he said. Instead, went 'directly through our communities, through various organizations.' 'There are many projects. We will determine which ones are critical and need immediate solutions,' he said. 'We can provide part of this funding through our state finances.' Zelenskyy said the priorities will be 'those that primarily concern Ukrainian children, our veterans and programs to protect our infrastructure.' On his first day back in office, Trump placed a 90-day freeze on foreign aid while the U.S. reviews whether the aid is aligned with Trump’s America First agenda. Also on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview on state television that Moscow would hold peace talks with Kyiv, but he said he would not speak to Zelenskyy, calling him and illegitimate leader. 'Negotiations can be held with anyone,' the Russian president said. 'But due to [Zelenskyy’s] illegitimacy, he has no right to sign anything.' In return, the Ukrainian president said, 'Putin once again confirmed that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders, and does everything possible to prolong the war,' he wrote on X. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, national and local elections were banned under a martial law act passed by Ukraine. A presidential election would have occurred in March 2024, and Zelenskyy’s term would have ended in May 2024.

North Korea's Kim calls for bolstering nuclear forces, state media says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for bolstering nuclear forces this year, during a visit to a nuclear material production base and nuclear weapons institute, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. His trip highlighting the country's growing nuclear arsenal came as Pyongyang has been ramping up its show of force around U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office with a resumption of missile tests, which South Korea said were partly aimed at drawing Trump's attention. Kim praised scientists and other workers there for achieving 'remarkable successes' and 'amazing production results' in their work last year as he was briefed about the process for producing weapons-grade nuclear materials and their plan for 2025 and beyond, KCNA reported. Kim called for further success in producing weapons-grade nuclear materials this year and strengthening the country's nuclear forces. 'This year is a crucial year, as it is an important watershed in which we should carry out the tasks in the important period in the course of implementing the line of bolstering up the nuclear forces,' Kim said, according to KCNA. North Korea faces 'the world's most unstable security situation' due to a long-standing confrontation with 'the most vicious hostile countries,' which makes it indispensable for the country to boost its nuclear capability, he added. Pyongyang has long argued that its nuclear arsenal is aimed at fending off threats from Washington and its allies, which fought the North during the 1950-53 Korean War. Analysts estimate North Korea may have produced enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads. Seoul's National Intelligence Service has said the North's recent display of force was in part intended to 'show off its U.S. deterrent assets and draw Trump's attention' after vowing 'the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction' at a key year-end policy meeting last month. Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim during his first term and has touted their personal rapport, said last week he would 'reach out to him again.' On the day of his inauguration, Trump described North Korea as a 'nuclear power,' as had Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his Senate confirmation hearing, raising questions about whether Washington would seek arms reduction talks rather than denuclearization negotiations. At his Senate confirmation hearing, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed Trump's past engagement with North Korea and said he believed there 'has to be an appetite for a very serious, broader North Korea policy.' Rubio said Trump's engagement 'ultimately didn't achieve everything,' but Kim did stop testing missiles, though the North Korean leader viewed his nuclear weapons as 'his insurance policy to stay in power.' South Korea has said North Korea's denuclearization must remain the goal for any engagement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Trump would continue to pursue a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Wednesday that Trump will pursue North Korea's 'complete denuclearization,' citing National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-calls-for-bolstering-nuclear-forces-state-media-says/7954061.html	2025-01-28T17:58:17-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Advocacy group finds sexual assault, overcrowding in Iraqi prisons	According to the Justice for Prisoners Network, women in Iraqi prisons face rampant sexual assault and harassment, often during interrogations, with thousands detained without trial. Overcrowding further worsens conditions, with some facilities holding up to ten times their capacity. Despite the passage of a general amnesty law in 2024 aimed at addressing overcrowding, systemic issues persist, and advocates continue to call for urgent reforms and better treatment for prisoners, particularly women.

UN: Civilians' suffering 'unimaginable' in Congolese city under rebel attack	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the eastern Congolese city under threat from Rwandan-backed rebels said Tuesday that civilian suffering there is 'truly unimaginable' and called for 'urgent and coordinated' international action to end the fighting. 'Immediate action is required to alleviate the suffering of civilians and enable lifesaving humanitarian efforts to proceed,' said Vivian van de Perre, the deputy head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known as MONUSCO. She briefed the second emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in the last 72 hours on the situation in Goma. Van de Perre spoke from the city by video call, wearing a flak jacket and military helmet. 'Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted in Goma, and medical facilities are completely overwhelmed due to the intensity of the ongoing combat and the proximity of the front lines,' she said. 'Humanitarian operations have been suspended or readjusted.' The World Food Program said Tuesday it is temporarily pausing its operations in North Kivu province, of which Goma is the capital. WFP said that will affect 800,000 people who would not get food aid due to the insecurity. The agency warned that if the fighting is drawn out, it could lead to a food shortage and high prices in the city of 2 million to 3 million people. Civilians are not the only ones running out of supplies. 'Many troops are now running out of critical equipment, especially water, food, medical supplies and blood,' van de Perre said. 'In some camps, fuel shortages have rendered generators inoperable, affecting communications equipment.' In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. said the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. At Tuesday’s Security Council meeting, Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner expressed her government’s frustration with the lack of a strong international response. 'Over this past 72 hours, we've seen a regional tragedy that could have been prevented if the Council had been able to take action,' she told its members. She said she had asked for action at its first meeting on Sunday and asked if 'this council is unwilling to act?' Some 2,574 kilometers away in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, protesters turned violent Tuesday, attacking, looting and burning some embassies, including those of France and Rwanda. The U.S. State Department said on its X account that its embassy is closed until further notice. Rwanda’s U.N. ambassador condemned the attack, saying it was 'totally burned down.' 'Rwanda calls on the DRC to take its diplomatic obligations seriously and hold perpetrators accountable,' Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo told council members. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Kenyan President William Ruto said he plans to hold crisis talks Wednesday with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame at an emergency meeting of the East African Community. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a phone call Monday with Tshisekedi, 'condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of the DRC.' Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-civilians-suffering-unimaginable-in-congolese-city-under-rebel-attack-/7954024.html	2025-01-28T16:45:42-08:00

Namibian officials hopeful aid will resume after Trump's 90-day freeze	Windhoek, Namibia — Health officials in Nambia are reacting with caution to the order from U.S. President Donald Trump last week that freezes most U.S. foreign aid. Though the country receives U.S. aid to bolster health care, especially the fight against AIDS, authorities say the 90-day freeze will have minimal impact, at least in the short run. An estimated 219,000 people in Namibia — about 13% of the adult population —have either HIV or AIDS, giving the country one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. About 3,800 people in Namibia die from AIDS each year. Still, Namibia has made significant gains against the disease over the years, even surpassing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of having 95% of the population tested and effectively treated for HIV. Two American agencies — the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) have been crucial to Namibia’s progress. That aid is now on hold, but Kalumbi Shangula, Namibia’s minister of health and social services, believes the hold is temporary. 'We are confident that the review will find no deviation from the intended purposes, and I am confident that after the review, the funding will resume to the programs which are supported by the United States of America,' Shangula said. The Trump administration announced last week that the 90-day pause will be used to determine whether U.S. aid is being used for its intended purpose and whether beneficiaries are acting in line with U.S. interests. Nikodemus Kamangoti is part of an organization called the Rights Not Rescue Trust. The organization receives U.S. funding through KP-Star, a program that provides access to HIV services for key populations. KP-Star sets up mobile vans at night to provide HIV and reproductive health services, including HIV testing and treatment, and access to family planning options. Kamangoti says his organization has received millions annually through USAID since it started its activities in 2008. Due to the funding freeze, the mobile vans are grounded now. He is hoping the funding will resume in the future. 'Currently, we have been really affected by that issue, actually, the decision that the president has taken,' he said. 'But as a human being, I respect his decision.' Asked how Trump’s executive order will affect U.S.-funded programs in Namibia, Tiffany Miller, the public affairs officer at the U.S. Embassy, told VOA in an emailed response that 'Consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid, Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio has paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and USAID for review. He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibian-officials-hopeful-aid-will-resume-after-trump-s-90-day-freeze/7954001.html	2025-01-28T16:03:39-08:00	
New private sector initiative to help victims of the California fires	California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday launched LA Rises, a private sector initiative aimed at raising money to help residents of Southern California rebuild their lives in the wake of the recent, devastating fires. Rebuilding will be expensive, with some estimates reaching as high as $40 billion. The fires, which began three weeks ago, killed 28 people, burned through more than 4,000 square meters and destroyed more than 16,000 buildings, according to Cal Fire. Newsom recruited basketball legend Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, Dodgers baseball team Chairman Mark Walter and Casey Wasserman, president and chairperson of LA28, to help recruit other philanthropists for the initiative. 'With Mark, Earvin and Casey’s proven leadership and deep commitment to Los Angeles, we’ll tap into the enormous creativity, experience, and resources of the private sector, alongside local, state, and federal efforts, to deliver a recovery that benefits all Angelenos,' the governor said in a statement Tuesday 'It’s time for those with means to come forward and make a positive impact to build back better,' Walter said. The initiative already has a pledge of up to $100 million from Walter, his family’s foundation and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation. 'We can’t lose hope,' Newsom said while urging victims of the fires to seek support from the new philanthropic effort, known as LA Rises. 'It is possible that we can come back more climate resilient, come back stronger.' Three of the biggest fires that hit the region are almost fully contained, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton fire is 99% contained, followed by the Hughes fire at 98% containment. And the Palisades fire is 95% contained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-private-sector-initiative-to-help-victims-of-the-california-fires-/7953764.html	2025-01-28T15:53:58-08:00	
White House to open media access to podcasters, influencers	WASHINGTON — Podcasters and social media influencers will be permitted to apply for credentials to cover the White House, the new press secretary announced Tuesday. In her first briefing, Karoline Leavitt told reporters that a wider range of individuals will be eligible to apply for White House press credentials. 'We welcome independent journalists, podcasters, social media influencers and content creators to apply for credentials to cover this White House,' Leavitt said. That move to open up the White House is part of the administration’s aim to significantly increase the number of journalists with White House access, said Leavitt. At 27 years old, Leavitt is the youngest person to hold the White House press secretary job. 'The Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media that are seated in this room,' Leavitt said. She cited a Gallup poll showing low trust in media in the United States, particularly among younger people. 'As long as you are creating news content of the day and are a legitimate, independent journalist, you are welcome to cover this White House,' she added. Leavitt said credentials will be given to those who meet the White House’s criteria and pass a Secret Service background check. The credentials, known as hard passes, make it easier for journalists to attend press briefings and access the White House campus. The White House Correspondents’ Association did not immediately reply to VOA’s request for comment. In his reelection campaign, Trump talked to several podcasters and social media influencers, including many directed at conservative audiences, in an effort to reach younger Americans. At Tuesday’s briefing, Leavitt said the administration intends to reinstate the credentials of about 440 journalists whose badges, she said, were 'wrongly revoked' by the Biden administration in 2023. In May 2023, the Biden White House announced updated standards for a yearly renewal of passes. Only one journalist who applied under the revised criteria was denied a new pass, the White House told Politico at the time. During Tuesday’s briefing, The Associated Press asked Leavitt whether she views her job as press secretary as 'advocating on behalf of the president or providing the unvarnished truth.' AP reporters traditionally ask that question at a new press secretary’s first briefing. Leavitt responded, 'I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day. I commit to speaking on behalf of the president.' The press secretary added that she expects reporters to hold themselves to the same standard, adding there 'have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets about this president.' Trump has had a contentious relationship with news outlets that he accuses of biased coverage. In recent months, he has filed several lawsuits against U.S. media outlets over what he believes is unfair coverage. On Monday, lawyers for the board that awards Pulitzer Prizes asked a Florida state court to pause the defamation lawsuit Trump filed against the board members in 2022 until he is no longer president. Trump accuses the Pulitzer board of defaming him by continuing to honor The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Democrats, fund recipients challenge order to freeze federal spending	WASHINGTON — A federal judge quickly put on hold Tuesday part of the Trump administration's order to freeze much of the government's funding after a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ordered the White House not to block funding to existing programs until Feb. 3 when a hearing will be held in Washington. The Trump administration's order was set to go into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday. The lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups representing nonprofit organizations, small-business owners and public health professionals. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at her first news conference, defended the freezing of domestic grant and aid programs, telling reporters it is the responsibility of the new administration 'to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.' Leavitt emphasized President Donald Trump’s order will not harm individual assistance programs, including 'Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits' and other 'assistance that is going directly to individuals.' Democrats on Capitol Hill say that is not accurate and that chaos is resulting from Trump’s order, which the party’s leader in the U.S. Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, characterizes as 'lawless, destructive, dangerous and cruel.' 'People are in a panic about it,' Schumer told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. The frozen funds, totaling 'billions, perhaps, trillions of dollars that help American families every single day' include monies allocated for disaster assistance, local law enforcement, rural hospitals, aid to the elderly and food for people in need, according to Schumer. 'The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,' announced the Office of Management and Budget in its memo ordering the funding halt. 'I’m warning the Trump administration – the law is the law,' said Senator Patty Murray, from the state of Washington. 'Avoid this pointless, damaging chaos.' Murray is the vice chair of the Senate’s appropriations committee, which oversees and manages the allocation of funding from the federal government. Other Democrats on the Senate’s appropriations and budget committees unsuccessfully tried to get their Republican colleagues to delay Thursday’s confirmation hearing for the president’s pick to run the OMB. 'The Senate Budget Committee will proceed' with the nomination of Russell Vought, responded the committee’s chairman, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Vought, who also ran OMB in the first Trump administration, said in two recent confirmation hearings before other Senate committees that he believed a 1974 'impoundment' law, which prevents presidents for blocking spending authorized by Congress, is unconstitutional. 'We are hearing from Medicaid offices across the country' that they have been locked out of federal funding systems, said Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, a member of the finance committee. Stealing the power of the purse from Congress is part of a 'sweeping authoritarian power grab' by the president since Trump took office one week ago, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, told reporters at the Capitol. 'Donald Trump is stealing from taxpayers to fund tax cuts for billionaires, and House Republicans are celebrating,' said Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, in a statement. Republicans in Congress reject that perception. The president’s order is intended to ensure the government’s money 'is spent wisely and well,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters Tuesday afternoon in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. He added it is not unusual for a new administration to pause funding, noting the previous president, Democrat Joe Biden, did so regarding the allocated money for expansion of a wall on the U.S. southern border of Mexico, which was a highlighted project of the first Trump administration. Biden’s action was not as sweeping as the one taken this week by the Trump administration. 'Everybody take a deep breath, stay calm' during the 90-day review of the federally funded programs, advised Senator James Risch, the Idaho Republican who chairs the foreign relations committee. 'We’ll get this done and reduce spending.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-fund-recipients-challenge-order-to-freeze-federal-spending-/7953712.html	2025-01-28T15:14:30-08:00

UN chief appeals Israeli law banning UNRWA	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed to Israel’s government to retract a new law essentially banning the U.N. agency that assists Palestinians. The law goes into effect this week. 'I regret this decision and request that the Government of Israel retract it,' Guterres wrote in a Monday letter to Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon that was obtained by VOA. The U.N. chief said the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA as it is known, is irreplaceable and that no other organization has the capacity or mandate to do its work. On Oct. 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban UNRWA. Israel says some UNRWA staff participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel. The United Nations investigated the accusations and fired nine staffers. 'The legislation forbids UNRWA from operating within the sovereign territory of the state of Israel, and forbids any contact between Israeli officials and UNRWA,' Israel’s ambassador told reporters Tuesday. 'Furthermore, UNRWA will be prohibited from maintaining any representative office, service or activity within our territory. Israel will terminate all collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA, or anyone acting on its behalf.' Danon said UNRWA must cease all operations and evacuate its headquarters in East Jerusalem. The secretary-general said in his letter that Israel’s 'unilateral demand' that UNRWA 'cease operations and evacuate all premises within less than a week of formal notice' is 'unreasonable and inconsistent' with Israel’s international obligations and that the U.N. and Israel should have discussions about the law, which goes into effect on Thursday. Impact on Gaza At a meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the situation, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said implementing the law now would be disastrous. He said the agency is even more critical as the Israeli-Hamas ceasefire is implemented and humanitarian agencies race to provide aid to millions of Palestinians. 'Across the Gaza Strip, Palestinians are turning to UNRWA — the agency they have known all their lives — for support,' Lazzarini said. 'Curtailing our operations now — outside a political process, and when trust in the international community is so low — will undermine the ceasefire. It will sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition.' Israeli officials say other aid agencies can take over UNRWA’s work, but Lazzarini disagreed. 'Since October 2023, we have delivered two-thirds of all food assistance, provided shelter to over a million displaced persons, and vaccinated a quarter of a million children against polio,' he told the council. 'Since the ceasefire began, UNRWA has brought in 60% of the food entering Gaza, reaching more than half a million people.' The agency also is the primary provider of health care and education for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank. 'We are determined, however, to stay and deliver until it is no longer possible to do so,' Lazzarini said. United Nations officials have repeatedly stressed that if the Knesset legislation is enforced and UNRWA dismantled, then Israel, as the occupying power, would have the legal responsibility for providing essential services to the Palestinian population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-israeli-law-banning-unrwa/7953674.html	2025-01-28T14:08:05-08:00	
Surge in terror attacks in northern Nigeria raises analysts' concern	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Security analysts in Nigeria are expressing alarm after a surge in attacks by terror groups in the country’s north near the border with Niger. The deterioration of relations between Abuja and Niamey following Niger's July 2023 coup has disrupted joint military patrols, creating opportunities for armed groups to intensify incursions and attacks. Last Friday's killing of 20 soldiers, including a commanding officer, at a military base in the remote town of Malam Fatori is among the latest attacks by terror groups. Malam Fatori is located near Nigeria's border with Niger. Suspected fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) arrived in trucks outfitted with guns and overpowered Nigerian troops in a coordinated assault. That attack took place three weeks after a similar raid on a military base in nearby Damboa, in Borno state, where six soldiers were killed. On Sunday, Nigeria's defense authorities announced that 22 soldiers died during military operations against militants in Borno state between Jan. 16 and 25. They also said troops killed nearly 80 militants during those operations. Kabiru Adamu, an analyst with Beacon Security and Intelligence Limited, explained the growing challenge. 'If the Nigerian military does not take steps to fortify those locations, we'd see attacks around that proximity increase. It appears to be that the objective of that particular attack is to weaken the response capability of the Nigerian military,' Adamu said. 'The fact that they did not fortify that place, the fact that they did not quickly replenish what was lost — we've seen consistently where churches are being burnt, military bases are being attacked.' The terror threat is not limited to northeastern Nigeria. In the northwest, a new militant group called Lakurawa is wreaking havoc in remote communities and crossing the border into Niger. Nigerian authorities first raised the alarm about the group in November, stating it has ties to jihadist factions in Mali and Niger, and had embedded itself in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border for years, marrying local women and recruiting young men. Strained relations between Nigeria and Niger following the July 2023 coup have disrupted joint security operations, allowing groups like ISWAP and Lakurawa to expand their activities. Nigeria is already engaged in a protracted counterinsurgency war, and Adamu said the situation is becoming increasingly complex. 'Lakurawa is a radicalized group and so the same counterterrorism approach that Nigeria is implementing in the northeast is what it will implement in the northwest,' Adamu said. 'But what this means is that there's a new theater of conflict — the northeast and the northwest. Given the fact that Nigerian military resources are strained, it poses a challenge.' Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said the government must adopt a more proactive and comprehensive approach to addressing the insecurity. 'The Sahel region, for two years or more, has been regarded as the epicenter of terrorism and Nigeria shares a lot of borders with the core Sahelian countries. So it's definitely a challenge now with the diplomatic spat that is affecting other areas of security and intelligence,' Iroegbu said. 'I'm not surprised about their emergence. In past years, there were reports about the growing linkage between bandits and what is happening in the northwest as terrorist organizations, and I don't think the authorities made any concrete effort.' Last week, a federal court in Nigeria declared the Islamist Lakurawa group a terrorist organization, allowing the military to use maximum force against the group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/surge-in-terror-attacks-in-northern-nigeria-raises-analysts-concern/7953646.html	2025-01-28T13:44:19-08:00	
Puntland blocks illegal entry of foreigners in IS crackdown	NAIROBI, KENYA — Authorities in Somalia’s Puntland region this week banned the illegal entry of foreigners and ordered telecom companies to deactivate SIM cards linked to undocumented people and Islamic State terrorists. The moves are an attempt to disrupt Islamic State financial networks as the military continues an offensive against IS fighters hiding out in the region. Authorities recently launched military operations against IS fighters in the Alimiskaad and Al-Madow mountains in Puntland’s Bari region. Security forces seized camps and defensive positions and pushed the fighters further into the mountains. Security agencies have also started a crackdown on undocumented people in Puntland. According to local reports, authorities made more than 300 arrests in the operation. Meanwhile, Puntland’s Ministry of the Interior has issued a directive banning the sale of SIM cards to undocumented people and barring them from opening financial accounts without proper identification. Abdirahman Yusuf Farah, a former intelligence chief of Puntland, said that security agencies will not violate people's rights in their pursuit of members and supporters of IS and that anyone who has entered the Puntland region legally will be respected. The International Crisis Group, in a report released in December, said Islamic State’s Somalia branch was becoming influential in dispersing money to finance terrorism elsewhere in Africa. The group extorts civilians and businesses to finance its operation and sends money to other IS affiliates. Omar Mahmood, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group, said the IS threat is growing. 'It's not just about the Islamic State in Puntland or in Somalia itself, but the group there serves as a connective node for Islamic State affiliates elsewhere in Africa — in Eastern Africa, in Southern Africa,' Mahmood said. 'They report to the Islamic State in Puntland, and that serves as a connection to the Islamic State core and other affiliates outside of the continent.' Mahmood said Puntland is trying to block the local IS’s access to international banking systems. 'The group has focused on developing its financial capabilities, whether that is extortion in Bosaso and then transferring this externally,' he said. 'They've really developed that particular niche, much more so than operational capacity. Puntland is trying to crack down on the use of their formal systems, whether that is the banking sector or telecom, to make it harder for the group to continue to, one, generate financially, and two, then send that money outside of Puntland.' Puntland is relatively peaceful compared to southern Somalia, but local officials have grown concerned about the Islamic State’s rising strength, fueled by foreign fighters. Authorities are seeking international financial and military aid, including air support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/puntland-blocks-illegal-entry-of-foreigners-in-is-crackdown/7953395.html	2025-01-28T11:11:52-08:00	
China sees boom in feasts for pets on Lunar New Year's Eve	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As pet parents in China usher in the Year of the Snake and host Lunar New Year’s Eve dinners with their loved ones, some are also making sure that their fur babies, or 'mao hai zi,' are not left out. Over the past month, a growing number of consumers have been ordering pet-friendly versions of the traditional New Year’s Eve reunion dinner, ranging from freshly made meals to gift boxes of dried food. A search for 'dogs’ and cats’ Lunar New Year’s Eve dinner' on Douyin, the Chinese version of Tiktok and the most popular short-video app in China, lists dozens of choices. ‘Lucky’ dumplings Some vendors even tout traditional Chinese delicacy dishes such as 'Buddha jumps over the wall,' which includes seafood and meats, and 'eight treasures duck rice' in addition to common ones such 'lucky' dumplings and rice cake, adapted for dog palates. The prices range from 19.9 to 168 yuan ($2.8 to $24) per set. One vendor on Douyin, LAOTOU Pet Bakery, told VOA in a written reply Monday that it sold out of the special holiday pet meals more than a week before the Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday this year. Lou Yu, vice president of Favor Pets Company in Beijing, also that the pet service firm has seen a boom year in holiday sales of pet food. Business peaked during the Dragon Boat Festival in June, Mid-Autumn Festival in September and the Christmas holidays in December, when, respectively, rice dumplings, moon cakes and special Christmas treats were offered for pets, he said. Booming holiday sales 'For [pets’] reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve, we’ve probably seen a 45% to 50% growth in sales this year, compared to a year ago, when sales were still tepid,' Lou told VOA by phone on Monday. The company ran out of stock before the eight-day-long holiday began this week as a growing number of owners splurge on their pets. Festive Fido and feline food have become an emerging and 'under-supplied' niche market that is bucking the trend despite China’s economic slowdown. China’s 'cat and dog parents' total more than 120 million, more than double from a decade ago, according to Lou. Last year, there were some 9.54 million babies born in China. Pets are expected to outnumber children under 4 years of age by a ratio of 2 to 1 by 2030 — a shift that will likely create a substantial $12 billion market for pet food in China, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs forecasted in a report late last year. Authorities in China ended the country’s one-child policy in 2016 and started encouraging young couples to have three children in 2021 as the country’s population ages and the number of newborns declines. Pets over kids By contrast, many couples who find it too expensive to raise children are instead choosing pets over kids. On Saturday, 11 dogs were treated with plates of shredded chicken and lettuce — a special Lunar New Year meal — in a Shanghai restaurant. Their owners were all female. 'He's my soulmate! He gives me a lot of emotional support … and he’s a good friend that I’d like to be with and enjoy the New Year atmosphere together,' attendee Momo Ni told Reuters news agency, referring to her border collie, Yakult. Daisy Xu, another 28-year-old owner, said her dog, named Niu Niu, is already a beloved member of the family. 'We will make her another dog meal. … When it comes to New Year gifts, I think my parents will probably give their granddaughter a red envelope,' Xu told Reuters. Adults traditionally give red envelopes containing money to children during the Lunar New Year. Rich people’s world While some Chinese social media users share postings of their pets’ special holiday treats, some users were not as enthusiastic, with several complaining that 'these dogs and cats are better fed than I am.' A Guizhou province-based Weibo user named 'magnolia0526' said, 'The luxurious lifestyle of cats and dogs highlights the uneven distribution of resources in human society, which is not cute at all.' The post was in response to the hashtag 'sales of reunion dinner and dumplings for pets has seen a 480% growth.' Another Shandong province-based user mocked the trend, saying 'this is the world of the rich people.' Aside from pet food, Favor Pet’s Lou said China has experienced a booming pet economy in recent years with growing business opportunities from pet grooming and sitting services, especially during holiday seasons. He said that a growing number of job seekers have signed up for the company’s training programs as they shift career paths to find opportunities in the pet service sector.

New Zealand reviews aid to Kiribati after island nation snubs official's visit	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — New Zealand is reconsidering all development funding to the aid-dependent island nation of Kiribati, following a diplomatic snub from the island nation's leader, government officials said. The unusual move to review all finance to Kiribati was prompted by the abrupt cancellation of a planned meeting this month between President Taneti Maamau and New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Peters' office told The Associated Press on Monday. It followed months of growing frustration from Australia and New Zealand — jointly responsible for more than a third of overseas development finance to Kiribati in 2022 — about a lack of engagement with the island nation. Tensions have risen since Kiribati aligned itself with China in 2019 and signed a series of bilateral deals with Beijing. Strategically important island nation The bond between Kiribati — population 120,000 — and its near neighbor New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, might not appear to be the South Pacific's most significant. But the acrimony reflects concern from western powers that their interests in the region are being undermined as China woos Pacific leaders with offers of funding and loans. That has provoked a contest for influence over Kiribati, an atoll nation that is among the world's most imperiled by rising sea levels. Its proximity to Hawaii and its vast exclusive economic zone — the world's 12th largest — have boosted its strategic importance. Powers vie for sway with aid Kiribati, one of the world's most aid-dependent nations, relies heavily on international support, with foreign assistance accounting for 18% of its national income in 2022, according to data from the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. About 10% of development finance that year came from New Zealand — which contributed 102 million New Zealand dollars ($58 million) between 2021 and 2024, official figures show. However, officials in Wellington and Canberra have expressed frustration over a lack of engagement from Tarawa regarding development projects. Frictions escalated when Kiribati suspended all visits from foreign officials in August, citing a need to focus on the government formation process after elections that month. Kiribati switched its allegiance from pro-Taiwan to pro-Beijing in 2019, joining a growing number of Pacific nations to do so. Self-governing Taiwan is claimed by China and, since the shift, Beijing has increased aid to Kiribati. Official snub provokes backlash Peters was scheduled to meet Maamau, who has led the country since 2016, in Kiribati on Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, Peters' office said, but was told a week before the trip that Maamau could not accommodate him. It would have been the first visit by a New Zealand minister in more than five years. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree joint priorities for our development program, and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' a statement supplied by Peters' office said. New Zealand will review all development cooperation with Kiribati as a result, the statement said. The government of Kiribati did not respond to a request for comment, although Education Minister Alexander Teabo told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday that Maamau had a long-standing engagement on his home island — and denied a snub. New Zealand cautioned that the diplomatic rift could have broader consequences, including affecting New Zealand resident visas for Kiribati citizens and participation in a popular seasonal work scheme that brings Pacific horticulture and viticulture workers to New Zealand. New Zealand — home to large populations of Pacific peoples — is a popular spot for those from island nations to live and work. 'In the meantime, New Zealand stands ready, as we always have, to engage with Kiribati at a high level,' said the statement. Australia's softer approach The decision to review all development funding is a 'different, and more forceful approach' than New Zealand has taken before, said Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and contrasted with a different tack taken recently by Australia — which is Kiribati's biggest funder. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles traveled to the island nation this month as planned to deliver a patrol boat promised to Kiribati in 2023 — even though he did not meet with Maamau. Australia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the country 'remains committed to its longstanding partnership with Kiribati.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-reviews-aid-to-kiribati-after-island-nation-snubs-official-s-visit/7953266.html	2025-01-28T10:14:49-08:00	
China tests US commitment to South China Sea by pressuring Philippines	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A little more than a week after Beijing and Manila reached an agreement aimed at easing tensions in the South China Sea, the Philippines has accused Chinese coast guard vessels of fresh incursions, harassment and 'aggressive maneuvers.' Analysts say the pressure campaign, which has stepped up in recent days, is part of Beijing’s attempt to test the United States’ commitment to support the Philippines. 'They want to see how far they can push the Philippines under the new administration in the U.S.,' Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone. In a statement released on social media platform X last Saturday, the Philippine coast guard said two vessels from the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries encountered 'aggressive maneuvers' from three Chinese coast guard vessels while heading to Sandy Cay for a marine scientific survey last Friday. In one video released by Manila, a large Chinese coast guard vessel was seen moving within a few meters of one Philippine vessel. Another video showed a Chinese helicopter hovering above two inflatable boats carrying Philippine crew members. Philippine coast guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the Philippine vessels were forced to suspend the scientific survey due to the 'continuous harassment and the disregard for safety' shown by the Chinese coast guard. In response to Manila’s accusations, Beijing said Chinese coast guard vessels 'thwarted' two Philippine vessels’ attempts to 'land on' Sandy Cay, which China calls 'Tiexian Reef.' 'The vessels attempted to illegally land on the reef and conduct sand sampling. China Coast Guard [CCG] vessels lawfully obstructed the Philippine ships' course and warned them away,' the Chinese coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement released last Friday. China views almost all of the South China Sea as its territory and is engaged in a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, that have overlapping claims over the strategic waterway. Apart from the incident near Sandy Cay, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels had successfully kept Chinese coast guard vessels from operating in waters near the coastline of the Philippines’ Zambales province since last Friday. 'The Philippine Coast Guard [PCG] vessel has maintained the China Coast Guard vessel to keep a distance of 90-100 nautical miles away from the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone,' said Jay Tarriela from the Philippine coast guard in a post on social media platform X on Sunday. Then on Monday, the Philippine coast guard said its vessels were hindered by Chinese coast guard vessels while trying to recover the body of a dead Philippine fisherman from a Philippine fishing boat. The series of incidents comes more than a week after senior Chinese and Philippine diplomats vowed to settle territorial disputes in the South China Sea through dialogues during a bilateral consultation. Although the agreement has allowed the Philippines to conduct resupply missions to its forces near the disputed Second Thomas Shoal since late last year, some experts say the latest incidents are part of a bigger effort by Beijing to drive a wedge between Manila and Washington. 'Beijing isn’t happy with Manila’s assertive stance in the South China Sea and its close ties with the United States, so [these factors] serve as convenient justifications for Beijing to try to push Manila in the South China Sea,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. Despite the persistent Chinese aggression, Koh said some in Manila think the Philippines can maintain its current approach in the South China Sea since there is bipartisan support for a more assertive position against China in the U.S. and some Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have reiterated Washington’s 'ironclad' defense commitment to the Philippines during interactions with their Philippine counterparts last week. 'Manila appears to be more cautiously optimistic that it can maintain the current policy, knowing that there is U.S. backing for that,' he told VOA by phone. To counter Beijing’s pressure campaign, Don McLain Gill, a lecturer in international studies at De La Salle University in the Philippines, said it’s important for the Philippines and its allies, including the United States, to maintain close collaboration in areas such as joint maritime exercises. Since China is expected to 'continue pressing the Philippines into submission with its grey zone operations, which are now shifting from low intensity to high intensity, this must be addressed with more robust presence operations between the alliance and like-minded partners, along with continued support in the Philippines military modernization in line with the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept,' he told VOA in a written response. With the Trump administration’s announcement to suspend new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance for 90 days, however, Chong in Singapore said Beijing may think there is a window of opportunity to pressure countries like the Philippines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tests-us-commitment-to-south-china-sea-by-pressuring-philippines/7953276.html	2025-01-28T09:54:16-08:00

Jordan engages with Syria’s HTS leaders to tackle terrorism	AMMAN, JORDAN — Jordan, which faces new regional challenges in dealing with Syria’s transitional Islamist regime, is pursuing a strategy of containment through engagement to secure its long, shared border, analysts say. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week that Jordan has engaged 'very deeply' from day one with Syria’s new Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leaders to tackle challenges both countries face. 'Terrorism is one common threat,' al-Safadi said. 'We see Daesh [Islamic State] rearming, regrouping. [They] acquired a lot of weapons from the stockpiles of the Syrian army. Drug trafficking is still happening to Jordan. We have the same interests here in ending that threat. We have an interest in Syria succeeding. What happens in Syria will have a direct impact on us. If Syria succeeds, we will all benefit.' Farah Bdour, a senior adviser with the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, said Jordan must address such 'pressing issues as securing its 380-kilometer shared border with Syria to prevent the spillover of instability.' Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s 'success or failure will directly impact Jordan’s stability,' Bdour said. 'Should HTS’s transition falter, the group could revert to its militant roots, reigniting conflict and posing renewed threats to Jordan’s security,' she warned in the group’s online publication, underscoring HTS’s former link to al-Qaida. Jordanian analyst Amer al-Sabaileh, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, told VOA that Jordan can reshape and support efforts for 'Damascus to be a good counterpart' by working together on concerns such as security, logistics, telecommunications and electricity. 'This might help Jordan to reshape a good relation based on a win-win situation, where Jordan, as well, can definitely benefit from a new reality in Syria, especially on the level of political influence, political interest and definitely being part of rebuilding Syria,' Al Sabaileh said. 'But HTS is not controlling all the Syrian geography. ISIS [Islamic State] has growing capacities, desire to control certain areas closer to the Jordanian borders.' Bdour and al-Sabaileh also warned that HTS’s Islamist ideology could influence other similar movements, including Jordan’s Muslim Brotherhood. Bdour pointed to attempts by the Brotherhood to dominate Jordanian public sentiment over the Gaza conflict and its political gains in parliamentary elections last September. 'What happened in Syria might trigger the appetite and desire for power of all the political Islam groups: Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, who at the end, think that maybe they deserve also to be recognized in certain areas, if they prove to be on the map,' al= Sabaileh said. Bdour wrote that even 'if HTS successfully transitions to a governing regime, its Islamic orientation poses a unique challenge for Jordan.' She pointed to critics of the group who say they 'fear that legitimizing HTS could embolden dormant extremist factions within Jordan,' possibly 'exacerbating internal tensions.' Ultimately, she said, 'Jordan must navigate these overlapping domestic and regional challenges, as HTS’s trajectory, and its implications for Syria, Jordan and the broader Middle East, remains deeply uncertain.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-engages-with-syria-s-hts-leaders-to-tackle-terrorism/7953149.html	2025-01-28T08:08:20-08:00

Trump takes aim at DEI, COVID expulsions and transgender troops	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders on Monday to remove diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, from the military, reinstate thousands of troops who were kicked out for refusing COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, and take aim at transgender troops. Earlier on Monday, Pete Hegseth, who narrowly secured enough votes to become defense secretary, referred to the names of Confederate generals that were once used for two key bases during his remarks to reporters as he entered the Pentagon on his first full day on the job. Trump signed the executive orders while flying back from Miami to Washington, D.C. One of the executive orders signed by Trump said that expressing a 'gender identity' different from an individual's sex at birth did not meet military standards. While the order banned the use of 'invented' pronouns in the military, it did not answer basic questions including whether transgender soldiers currently serving in the military would be allowed to stay and, if not, how they would be removed. Trump's plans have been heavily criticized by advocacy groups, which say his actions would be illegal. 'President Trump has made clear that a key priority for his administration is driving transgender people back into the closet and out of public life altogether,' Joshua Block, with the ACLU, said earlier on Monday. During his first term, Trump announced that he would ban transgender troops from serving in the military. He did not fully follow through with that ban his administration froze their recruitment while allowing serving personnel to remain. Biden overturned the decision when he took office in 2021. The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, Department of Defense data shows. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands. When Trump announced his first ban in 2017, he said the military needed to focus on 'decisive and overwhelming victory' without being burdened by the 'tremendous medical costs and disruption' of having transgender personnel. Internal focus Hegseth has promised to bring major changes to the Pentagon, and he has made eliminating DEI from the military a top priority. Trump's executive order on ending DEI in the military said service academies would be required to teach 'that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.' The Air Force said on Sunday that it will resume instruction of trainees using a video about the first Black airmen in the U.S. military, known as the Tuskegee Airmen, which has passed review to ensure compliance with Trump's ban on DEI initiatives. Hegseth was warmly greeted on the steps of the Pentagon by the top U.S. military officer, Air Force General Charles Brown, whom Hegseth criticized in his latest book. Asked if he might fire Brown, Hegseth joked that he was standing right next to him. 'I’m standing with him right now. I look forward to working with him,' as he patted Brown on the back. Reuters has previously reported about the possibility of mass firing among top brass, something Hegseth repeatedly refused to rule out during his confirmation process. Hegseth referred to Fort Moore and Fort Liberty by their previous names, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg, while speaking with reporters. The names honoring Confederate officers were changed under former President Joe Biden as part of an effort to reexamine U.S. history and the Confederate legacy. 'I'm thinking about the guys and gals in Guam, Germany, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg,' Hegseth said. Much of Hegseth's focus at the Pentagon could be internal to the military, including making good on Trump's executive order on bringing back troops discharged for refusing COVID vaccines. Thousands of service members were removed from the military after the Pentagon made the vaccine mandatory in 2021. US missile defense Trump also signed an executive order that 'mandated a process to develop an ‘American Iron Dome’.' The short-range Iron Dome air defense system was built by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. backing, and it was built to intercept rockets fired by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza toward Israel. Each truck-towed unit fires radar-guided missiles to blow up short-range threats such as rockets, mortars and drones in midair. The system determines whether a rocket is on course to hit a populated area. If not, the rocket is ignored and allowed to land harmlessly. Any such effort would take years to implement in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-takes-aim-at-dei-covid-expulsions-and-transgender-troops/7952985.html	2025-01-28T05:24:26-08:00	
UN warns of worrying humanitarian situation in DRC’s Goma amid assault by Rwanda-backed rebels	United Nations — There was gunfire Tuesday in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma, as the United Nations warned of a worrying humanitarian situation amid clashes between Congolese soldiers and Rwandan-backed rebels who attacked the area and claimed to be in control. U.N. humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke told a briefing Tuesday that hospitals in Goma were overwhelmed. The World Food Program said it temporarily paused food assistance activities in the Goma area. Crisis talks were planned for Wednesday, Kenyan President William Ruto said, with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame set to attend. Ruto said there is no military solution to the conflict. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio 'condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States’ respect for the sovereignty of the DRC,' in a phone call Monday with Tshisekedi. A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Monday that fighting between the M23 rebels and the Congolese army in Goma is 'not over yet,' despite the rebel claims of control. 'Fighting is still very much ongoing,' said Bruno Lemarquis, U.N. resident coordinator in the DRC. 'It's a very, very fluid situation. It's a very dangerous situation.' He told reporters via a video call from DRC’s capital, Kinshasha, that 'active zones of combat have spread to all quarters' of Goma in North Kivu province. Lemarquis said there have been severe disruptions to water, electricity, internet and phone service. Humanitarian warehouses have been looted. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. says the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior U.N. officials are calling for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President João Lourenço. 'On behalf of the humanitarian community, I call on all parties to agree on temporary humanitarian pauses in the most affected areas and establish humanitarian corridors to ensure humanitarian activities resume at scale. And more importantly, also to facilitate the safe evacuation of wounded individuals and civilians trapped in combat zones,' Lemarquis added. The United Nations announced Sunday a $17 million disbursement from its central emergency fund for urgent humanitarian needs in DRC. Lemarquis said nonessential U.N. staff, foreign and Congolese, are being temporarily evacuated from Goma to either Kinshasa or to a U.N. base in Entebbe in neighboring Uganda. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym, MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'At this critical juncture now, the onus really is and has to be about bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities,' U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters on the same video call, speaking from Damascus, Syria, where he is on a mission. 'The fate of the millions of civilians living in Goma or having been displaced is really the priority, along with the safety and security of U.N. personnel,' he said. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-of-worrying-humanitarian-situation-in-drc-s-goma-amid-assault-by-rwanda-backed-rebels-/7952906.html	2025-01-28T04:15:40-08:00	
Dominican Republic ramping up deportation of Haitian migrants	SANTO DOMINGO — As spiraling violence in Haiti puts healthcare out of reach for most, Haitian mothers are seeking care at hospitals in neighboring Dominican Republic despite government policies there scaling up deportations. The two countries share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, but are divided by a heavily secured border, long-standing tensions and an immense wealth gap. Children born to Haitian parents in the Dominican Republic do not receive citizenship. 'I had my child here,' Cineas Lionne told Reuters from a hospital in the eastern city of Punta Cana. 'I don't think I would receive good care in Haiti because of the situation with the government - there is no government.' The U.N. found in October that less than a quarter of hospitals were operating around Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, while those elsewhere struggle to cope with flows of refugees fleeing gang attacks. That assessment came before a spike in violence in late 2024, that saw gangs shoot and kill journalists gathered at Haiti's largest public hospital for a government press conference meant to announce a long-awaited reopening. Those plans have been put on hold. The violence has forced the capital's airport and ports to repeatedly shut down, prompting hospitals to warn of a lack of supplies such as blood and oxygen. Aid group Doctors Without Borders temporarily halted services last year due to threats. 'The doctors here have treated me well,' said Beatrice Agustin, who gave birth in a maternity hospital in the Dominican capital. 'In Haiti there are many gangsters. You can't give birth there, but also if you are here without papers,' giving birth in the Dominican Republic is complicated, she said. U.N. experts have warned in recent years that pregnant and postpartum Haitian women seeking medical care in the Dominican Republic have faced intimidation, detention and deportation, citing raids on public hospitals and arrests during check-ups. The U.N. experts have called on neighboring nations to stop deporting Haitians back home, where over 5 million people are going hungry and over 1 million are internally displaced as armed gangs continue to gain territory. Many families are sharing homes or living in makeshift camps. The Dominican Republic has pledged to deport up to 10,000 people a week as it deals with the brunt of the migration of Haitians fleeing conflict at home. It deported over 200,000 Haitians last year and nearly 15,000 in first two weeks of 2025. Dominican politicians have accused Haitian migrants of fueling insecurity and said their country is already giving too much. 'Our infrastructure does not have the capacity to receive that number of people,' Senator and former health minister Daniel Rivera told Reuters, saying the priority was expanding healthcare for Dominicans. Local doctors said many Haitian women are afraid to attend prenatal checkups and tend to arrive late at night or when they are about to give birth, due to the risk of deportation. National health service director Martin Ortiz noted that migration officials are not permitted to enter to make arrests inside hospitals. 'Our mission is to provide care,' he said. 'The same care is given equally.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominican-republic-ramping-up-deportation-of-haitian-migrants-/7952850.html	2025-01-28T03:35:17-08:00	
Serbian prime minister to resign as popular protests persist	BELGRADE — Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic on Tuesday announced his resignation, becoming the highest ranking official to leave since anti-corruption protests spread across the country. Belgrade has seen daily anti-government protests since a roof collapsed in November at a railway station in Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, killing 15 people. Protesters including students, teachers and other workers have turned out in their thousands, blaming the disaster on corruption within the government of President Aleksandar Vucic. 'I opted for this step in order to reduce tensions,' Vucevic told a news conference on Tuesday, announcing his intention to resign. He said the mayor of Novi Sad will also resign. 'With this we have met all demands of the most radical protestors.' Vucevic has been the head of the ruling center-right Serbia Progressive Party since 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-prime-minister-to-resign-as-popular-protests-persist-/7952835.html	2025-01-28T03:19:29-08:00	
ICC prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan's West Darfur	UNITED NATIONS — The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Monday that his office will be seeking arrest warrants for those accused of atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region, which has seen reported ethnic cleansing by paramilitary forces that have been fighting government forces for 19 months. Karim Khan told the U.N. Security Council that crimes are being committed in Darfur 'as we speak and daily' and are being used as a weapon of war. He said that conclusion is the result of 'a hard-edged analysis' based on evidence and information collected by his office. Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Khan told the council in January there were grounds to believe both government forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, which was born out of the Janjaweed, may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur. The Biden administration, just before it left office this month, determined that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide in Sudan's civil war. And the ICC prosecutor told the council Monday that there are 'very clear echoes' in the current conflict of what happened 20 years ago. 'The pattern of crimes, the perpetrators, the parties, tracked very closely with the same protagonists, the same targeted groups as existed in 2003' and led the Security Council to refer Darfur to the ICC, Khan said. 'It’s the same communities, the same groups suffering, a new generation suffering the same hell that has been endured by other generations of Darfuris, and this is tragic.' Human Rights Watch in a major report last May said the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias carried out attacks against the ethnic Masalit and other non-Arab groups in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state, from April to June 2023, with attacks intensifying that November. At least thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced during the attacks, according to the report by the leading rights group. 'I can confirm today that my office is taking the necessary steps to put forward applications for warrants of arrest in relations to crimes we allege are being committed and have been committed in West Darfur,' Khan told the council on Monday. He gave no details on the specific crimes or the people the ICC wants arrested. But he did say his office is particularly concerned about a stream of allegations of gender crimes against women and girls, which he said were 'a priority' for the ICC. He said the last six months have seen 'a tailspin into deeper suffering, deeper misery for the people of Darfur,' with famine present, conflict increasing, children targeted, girls and women subjected to rape and the whole landscape 'one of destruction.' Khan had a simple message for those on the ground in El Geneina in West Darfur, the city of El Fasher in North Darfur, which is besieged by RSF forces, and elsewhere in Darfur: 'Now, better late than never, for goodness sake, comply with international humanitarian law, not as a charity, not out of some political necessity, but out of the dictates of humanity.' Khan told the council he made efforts to engage with the RSF to obtain information relevant to the ICC’s investigations, and members of his office met with representatives of the paramilitary force last week. 'I do expect, and hope, and require swift and meaningful action, and will be monitoring that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-seeking-arrest-warrants-for-those-accused-of-atrocities-in-sudan-s-west-darfur-/7952822.html	2025-01-28T02:55:30-08:00	
Fast-moving fires torch national parks in southeast Australia	SYDNEY — Firefighters were desperately trying to stop a cluster of fast-moving blazes in southeast Australia on Tuesday, as thousands of acres of national park burned and a farming community was forced to evacuate. Lightning strikes on Monday evening ignited several fires in the Grampians National Park, a forested mountain range about 300 kilometers west of Victoria's state capital Melbourne. A separate fast-moving fire in Little Desert National Park in the west of the state has torn through almost 65,000 hectares in less than 24 hours, emergency services said, scorching an area almost as large as Singapore. That fire had forced the evacuation of rural Dimboola before threat levels were downgraded on Tuesday afternoon. 'I'm incredibly thankful that no lives have been lost and we have no reports of injury either,' emergency management commissioner Rick Nugent told reporters. Chris Hardman from Forest Fire Management Victoria warned that weather conditions over the next few days are increasing the possibility the fires will spread. 'Right now firefighters are planning to do everything in their powers to protect communities,' he said. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Kevin Parkyn said stifling heatwave conditions would settle over parts of Victoria on Saturday, escalating fire risks. 'When we look at the next seven to 10 days, the main message is that there will be a hot dome over Victoria. 'Once we get into the weekend don't be surprised if we see heatwave conditions unfold across the state, and continue to intensify into next week. 'The landscape is dry, and if we continue to see these hot conditions, it will continue to dry the landscape out further.' Hotter temperatures are fueling increasingly severe natural disasters across Australia, researchers have found. Scientists have documented a marked increase in extreme fire weather across the country since the 1950s. The unprecedented 'Black Summer' bushfires of 2019-2020, for example, killed 33 people and millions of animals, razed vast tracts of forest and blanketed major cities in thick smoke.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fast-moving-fires-torch-national-parks-in-southeast-australia/7952808.html	2025-01-28T02:12:53-08:00	
Italian ship carrying migrants picked up offshore reaches Albania	TIRANA, ALBANIA — An Italian navy ship carrying 49 migrants picked up in international waters arrived in Albania on Tuesday, amid a new attempt by Italy to push ahead with a legally contested plan to relocate migrants to the neighboring country. The navy ship Cassiopea with the migrants reached the Albanian port of Shengjin early on Tuesday, according to a Reuters witness. They will be identified at a facility there and then moved to a detention center some 20 kilometer away. The navy did not provide details on the migrants. The Italian government of Giorgia Meloni has built two reception centers in Albania, the first such deal by a European Union nation to divert migrants to a non-EU country in a bid to limit sea arrivals to its territory. But the facilities have been empty since November after judges in Rome questioned the validity of the relocation plan and ordered the first two batches of migrants previously detained in Albania to be moved back to Italy. The controversy surrounding the plan, which Meloni sees as a cornerstone of her government's aim to curb immigration, revolves around a ruling by the European Court of Justice last year, which was not related to Italy. The Court said no nation of origin could be considered safe if even just a part of it was dangerous, undermining Rome's idea of deporting migrants to Albania who hailed from a selected list of 'safe' countries with a view to swiftly repatriate them. Ilaria Salis, a European Parliament deputy from a left-wing Italian party, on Monday criticized the Italian government for forcibly transferring 'innocent people fleeing war and misery' despite violations of international law and human rights. The European court is set to review Italy's plan in the coming weeks and clarify whether it is in compliance with EU law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-ship-carrying-migrants-picked-up-offshore-reaches-albania/7952804.html	2025-01-28T01:58:08-08:00	
More than 300,000 Palestinians returned to Gaza City, authorities say	The Hamas-run government in the Gaza Strip said more than 300,000 people displaced by the Israel-Hamas war returned Monday to northern Gaza after Israel opened checkpoints and allowed people back into the area. The Palestinians, mostly on foot, lugged what personal belongings they could manage as they headed back to see whether their one-time homes were still standing after they were forced to leave in the early stages of the war. But much of the region has been leveled during the Israeli bombardment targeting Hamas militants and buildings booby-trapped by Hamas. About a million people were ordered out of northern Gaza as the Israeli offensive began in October 2023. The military, until now, had prevented their return. The Palestinians’ return to Gaza City comes in the early stages of a six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has resulted in the release of seven hostages held in Gaza, the freeing of 300 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israeli officials said Monday that Hamas had provided information about the rest of the hostages due to be released in the first stage of the cease-fire, including that eight of those still being held are dead. The next round of hostage releases is due to take place later this week. U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend said he wants Jordan and Egypt to take in more displaced Palestinians as part of an effort to 'clean out' Gaza. But the two countries rejected the suggestion, saying the only way forward was creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The U.S. has long supported Palestinian statehood, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at the idea. The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military said the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 60 hostages and the remains of about 30 others, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel.

New Zealand reviews its aid to Kiribati after the Pacific island nation snubs an official's visit	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand is reconsidering all development funding to the aid-dependent island nation of Kiribati, following a diplomatic snub from the island nation's leader, government officials said. The unusual move to review all finance to Kiribati was prompted by the abrupt cancellation of a planned meeting this month between President Taneti Maamau and New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Peters' office told The Associated Press on Monday. It followed months of growing frustration from Australia and New Zealand — jointly responsible for more than a third of overseas development finance to Kiribati in 2022 — about a lack of engagement with the island nation. Tensions have risen since Kiribati aligned itself with China in 2019 and signed a series of bilateral deals with Beijing. A strategically important island nation The bond between Kiribati — population 120,000 — and its near neighbor New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, might not appear the South Pacific's most significant. But the acrimony reflects concern from western powers that their interests in the region are being undermined as China woos Pacific leaders with offers of funding and loans. That has provoked a contest for influence over Kiribati, an atoll nation that is among the world's most imperiled by rising sea levels. Its proximity to Hawaii and its vast exclusive economic zone — the world's 12th largest — have boosted its strategic importance. Powers vie for sway with aid Kiribati, one of the world's most aid-dependent nations, relies heavily on international support, with foreign assistance accounting for 18% of its national income in 2022, according to data from the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. About 10% of development finance that year came from New Zealand — which contributed 102 million New Zealand dollars ($58 million) between 2021 and 2024, official figures show. However, officials in Wellington and Canberra have expressed frustration over a lack of engagement from Tarawa regarding development projects. Frictions escalated when Kiribati suspended all visits from foreign officials in August, citing a need to focus on the government formation process after elections that month. Kiribati switched its allegiance from pro-Taiwan to pro-Beijing in 2019, joining a growing number of Pacific nations to do so. Self-governing Taiwan is claimed by China and since the shift, Beijing has increased aid to Kiribati. An official snub provokes backlash Peters was scheduled to meet Maamau, who has led the country since 2016, in Kiribati on Jan. 21 and Jan. 22, Peters' office said, but was told a week before the trip that Maamau could not accommodate him. It would have been the first visit by a New Zealand minister in more than five years. 'The lack of political-level contact makes it very difficult for us to agree joint priorities for our development program, and to ensure that it is well targeted and delivers good value for money,' a statement supplied by Peters' office said. New Zealand will review all development cooperation with Kiribati as a result, the statement added. The government of Kiribati did not respond to a request for comment, although Education Minister Alexander Teabo told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday that Maamau had a long-standing engagement on his home island — and denied a snub. New Zealand cautioned that the diplomatic rift could have broader consequences, including impacting New Zealand resident visas for Kiribati citizens and participation in a popular seasonal work scheme that brings Pacific horticulture and viticulture workers to New Zealand. New Zealand — home to large populations of Pacific peoples — is a popular spot for those from island nations to live and work. 'In the meantime, New Zealand stands ready, as we always have, to engage with Kiribati at a high level,' said the statement. Australia's softer approach The decision to review all development funding is a 'different, and more forceful approach' than New Zealand has taken before, said Blake Johnson, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and contrasted with a different tack taken recently by Australia — which is Kiribati's biggest funder. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles traveled to the island nation this month as planned to deliver a patrol boat promised to Kiribati in 2023 — even though he did not meet with Maamau. Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the country 'remains committed to its longstanding partnership with Kiribati.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-reviews-its-aid-to-kiribati-after-the-pacific-island-nation-snubs-an-official-s-visit/7952756.html	2025-01-27T23:29:50-08:00	
White House pauses federal grant, loan other assistance programs	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has temporarily paused grant, loan and other financial assistance programs at the Office of Management and Budget, according to a memo seen by Reuters, prompting criticism from congressional Democrats. The memo referenced the executive orders, including those seeking to dismantle programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), President Donald Trump has signed since taking office last week. 'In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be impacted by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,' Matthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in the memo. The suspension goes into effect on Jan. 28 at 5 p.m. eastern time, according to the memo. Top Democratic congressional budget appropriation lawmakers responded to reports of the memo by sending a letter demanding the OMB reverse its decision. 'The scope of what you are ordering is breathtaking, unprecedented, and will have devastating consequences across the country. We write today to urge you in the strongest possible terms to uphold the law and the Constitution and ensure all federal resources are delivered in accordance with the law,' Democratic Senator Patty Murray and Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro wrote. Agencies have until Feb. 10 to submit detailed information on any programs, projects or activities subject to the pause, the memo states. The suspension will provide the administration with time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of funding for those programs consistent with the law and Trump's priorities, it added. Agencies must identify legally mandated actions or deadlines for assistance programs before completing the analysis, it added. Vaeth directed federal agencies to halt all activities associated with open notices of funding opportunities. 'This memorandum requires federal agencies to identify and review all federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the president's policies and requirement,' Vaeth wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-pauses-federal-grant-loan-other-assistance-programs/7952752.html	2025-01-27T23:11:06-08:00	
Colombia sends air force planes to bring home migrants deported from the US	A Colombian Air Force jet was expected to land back in the country early Tuesday carrying 110 Colombians deported from the United States. The flight from San Diego, along with another traveling from Houston back to Colombia, follows a dispute sparked Sunday when Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to allow U.S. military planes to send deported Colombians back home. Petro said such treatment was disrespectful. His refusal prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten to impose tariffs, which Petro said he would reciprocate before the two countries announced they had reached an agreement to defuse the situation. Petro said the Colombian Air Force flights would allow the migrants to travel home 'without being handcuffed.' 'This provision: dignity for deportees, will be applied to all countries that send deportations to us,' Petro said. Trump has quickly moved to carry out deportations, one of his campaign pledges, since taking office last week. He said Monday that if countries do not accept their migrants fast, 'they’ll pay a very high economic price, and we’re going to immediately install massive tariffs.' While Colombia balked at the U.S. military flights, Guatemala has accepted several U.S. Air Force flights carrying Guatemalan migrants deported from the United States in recent days. The latest flight took place Monday, with 64 Guatemalans returning home. Guatemala’s Vice President Karin Herrera said Monday she was monitoring the care and condition of migrants arriving from the United States. 'Guatemalan migrants are people with rights and dignity. Our commitment is to guarantee that their arrival in the country, to their land, is in the best conditions,' Herrera said. U.S. deportation flights are not new, with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement carrying out hundreds of the flights each year. But the use of military flights is new, with the agency previously using commercial and chartered flights to deport people who are illegally in the United States. Some material for this article came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-sends-air-force-planes-to-bring-home-migrants-deported-from-the-us/7952750.html	2025-01-27T23:02:22-08:00	
China to prioritize physical education in schools as obesity rates rise	HONG KONG — China is aiming to beef up physical education in schools, making it core to the curriculum rather than a secondary subject, authorities said as they push for a more 'holistic education' amid growing concerns about the rise in childhood obesity. Primary and secondary schools must ensure physical education teachers are treated 'the same as their colleagues in subjects such as Chinese, math and English, and intensify efforts to develop key sports such as soccer, basketball and volleyball,' the official Xinhua news agency said, citing the country's Ministry of Education. 'These measures are part of a broader push for a more holistic approach to education, integrating physical fitness with academic development to cultivate well rounded students who are prepared for the future,' the Ministry said. The measures come after China issued its first national plan in January to build a 'strong education nation' by 2035. The policies included mandating primary and secondary school students to have at least two hours of physical activity daily, to effectively control myopia, or nearsightedness and obesity rates. In mid-2022 there was a nationwide shortage of around 120,000 physical education teachers, with rural areas the most affected, Xinhua said, adding that the new measures would encourage the recruitment of retired athletes and military veterans to help close the gap. Physical education teachers will receive equal compensation to their peers in other subjects, with performance based salary adjustments for after-school sports duties and team coaching, it said. Youth obesity has accelerated since 2019 due to decreased physical activity during COVID lockdowns and more online ordering of junk food. Doctors expect obesity to rise over the next 10-12 years as the economy slows and suffers structural changes that lead to poor eating habits and less physical activity. The proportion of obese boys in China jumped to 15.2% in 2022 from 1.3% in 1990, trailing the United States 22%, but higher than Japan's 6%, Britain's and Canada's 12% and India's 4%. Obesity in girls rose to 7.7% in 2022 from 0.6% in 1990. 'Obesity has become a major public health issue in China, ranking as the sixth leading risk factor for death and disability in the country,' the country's National Health Commission said in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-prioritize-physical-education-in-schools-as-obesity-rates-rise/7952745.html	2025-01-27T22:40:56-08:00	
Thailand denies mistreating detained gambling tycoon wanted by China	BANGKOK — Thailand denies abusing a jailed gambling tycoon fighting extradition to China over charges he ran illegal online gambling operations in Southeast Asia, the country's justice minister said on Tuesday. China-born She Zhijiang claims he received inhumane treatment in a Thai prison, including violence that has left him unable to stand, according to a letter his lawyers sent to Interpol and seen by Reuters. 'Our conduct towards him is like others (inmate) with regular access to lawyers,' Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong told reporters at Government House in Bangkok. Tawee said that there are security cameras in place that would prevent any abuse or torture of inmates. The minister did not comment on allegations by She's lawyers in the letter to Interpol that Chinese embassy officials visited the tycoon in prison against his will to persuade him to return to China. The gambling tycoon, who says the case against him is politically motivated, was arrested in Bangkok in 2022 on an international warrant and an Interpol red notice sought by Beijing. A Thai court in 2023 ordered his extradition to China but She is appealing the ruling. Tawee said Cambodia had also asked for She to be extradited as he is a Cambodian citizen. Tawee said She's extradition destination will be decided by the Appeal Court. According to media reports, She is the chairman of Yatai International Holdings Group, which has made gaming investments in Cambodia, the Philippines and, most recently, developed a $15 billion casino, entertainment and tourism complex in Myanmar's Karen State called Shwe Kokko. China's Foreign Ministry told Reuters in a statement on Sunday that She was a Chinese national and a 'key figure in online gambling and telecom fraud crimes,' saying the evidence against him was 'conclusive.' Southeast Asia - especially border areas between Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia - has become a hub for telecom and other online fraud since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the United Nations, which says hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to work in scam centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-denies-mistreating-detained-gambling-tycoon-wanted-by-china/7952744.html	2025-01-27T22:37:57-08:00

DOJ official: Trump administration fires team of lawyers who prosecuted him	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration on Monday fired more than a dozen Justice Department lawyers who brought two criminal cases against him, an official said, as the Republican moves swiftly to exert greater control over the department. The officials were fired after Acting Attorney General James McHenry, a Trump appointee, concluded they could not be trusted 'because of their significant role in prosecuting the President,' a Justice Department official said. McHenry cited Trump's power as chief executive under the U.S. Constitution to justify the firings, according to a copy of the termination letter seen by Reuters. The lawyers worked with Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions of Trump that the department dropped after his November election. Smith resigned from the department earlier this month. The norm-shattering move was made even though rank-and-file prosecutors by tradition remain with the department across presidential administrations and are not punished by virtue of their involvement in sensitive investigations. The firings are effective immediately. News of the firings came the same day that Ed Martin, the top federal prosecutor in Washington and a Trump appointee, opened an internal review into the use of a felony obstruction charge in prosecutions of people accused of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to a source familiar with the matter. The U.S. Supreme Court raised the legal bar for that offense in a 6-3 ruling last year, prompting prosecutors to drop the charge in several cases. Monday's moves came after the Trump administration already reassigned up to 20 senior career Justice Department officials, including Bradley Weinsheimer, the top ethics official, and the former chief of the public corruption section, Corey Amundson, from their roles. Amundson, whose section provided advice to Smith's prosecutors, announced his resignation on Monday. The moves to shake up the Justice Department's workforce have happened before the U.S. Senate votes on Trump's attorney general nominee Pam Bondi. Bondi's nomination is set to be voted on by a Senate panel on Wednesday. Smith, who was appointed by former Attorney General Merrick Garland, brought cases accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents at his Florida social club and attempting to interfere with the certification of the 2020 election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and argued the cases reflected a 'weaponization' of the legal system. Smith dropped both cases after Trump's election, citing a longtime policy against prosecuting a sitting president. Many of those who worked on Smith's cases were longtime public corruption and national security prosecutors who remained in the department when Smith closed his investigation earlier this month.

Rubio and Lammy reaffirm US-UK partnership on Indo-Pacific security, China challenges	State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with his British counterpart, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, on Monday to discuss a range of pressing global issues and joint initiatives aimed at promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable. 'They affirmed the depth of the U.S.-UK Special Relationship and the crucial nature of our partnership in addressing issues like the conflict in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and China’s malign influence,' State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. The U.K. government said that Lammy and Rubio look forward to meeting in person soon. 'They both welcomed the opportunity for the UK and the US to work together in alignment to address shared challenges including the situation in the Middle East, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, the challenges posed by China and the need for Indo-Pacific security,' the British statement read. The call between Rubio and Lammy came amid a report by The Guardian that China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Britain next month for the first U.K.-China strategic dialogue since 2018. In Beijing, Chinese officials did not confirm Wang’s plans to visit the U.K. but noted what they described as 'sound and steady growth' in relations between the two countries. 'China and the U.K. are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and major economies in the world,' Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stated during a briefing on Monday. She added it is in the common interest of the two countries to enhance strategic communication and deepen political mutual trust. Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference between Feb. 14 and 16, making it likely that his visit to the U.K. will take place either before or after the event. In the past, U.S. Secretaries of State have typically attended the high-profile annual gathering at the Munich Security Conference. The State Department has not responded to VOA’s inquiry about whether Rubio plans to hold talks with Wang during the conference. Last week, the State Department outlined U.S. policy toward China under President Donald Trump’s administration. 'Strategic competition is the frame through which the United States views its relationship with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The United States will address its relationship with the PRC from a position of strength in which we work closely with our allies and partners to defend our interests and values,' the State Department said on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-and-lammy-reaffirm-us-uk-partnership-on-indo-pacific-security-china-challenges/7952715.html	2025-01-27T20:20:57-08:00

Afghan women take scholarship tests offered by Pakistan	WASHINGTON — It took Susan Salih about eight hours to travel from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Peshawar, Pakistan, to take a scholarship exam the Pakistani government offers to Afghan students. Salih, 25, and a group of other young Afghan women who took the exam at the Institute of Management Sciences in Peshawar told VOA that despite being able to take the test online, they traveled, accompanied by family members, to sit for the exam in person 'to not miss the opportunity.' 'I hope this will pay off at least for those girls who now have the chance [to pursue their higher education],' said Salih, who could not pursue her dream of a post-graduate degree in Afghanistan after the Taliban banned women from attending universities in 2022. Pakistan's Higher Education Commission said about 5,000 young women were among 21,000 applicants for the 2,000 scholarships announced for Afghan students. These scholarships are part of the 4,500 Allama Muhammad Iqbal Scholarships for Afghan Students, the commission said. The Pakistan government said the undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships are fully funded, covering tuition fees, hostel dues, and living, book and travel allowances. Tests for the scholarships took place in-person and online on Saturday and Sunday in Peshawar and Quetta. Muhammad Waqar Khan, senior project manager at the Higher Education Commission, said students will be 'short-listed' for scholarships based on merit. 'After this [the tests], we will conduct interviews' with those students, Khan said. Pakistani officials earlier told VOA on the condition of anonymity that the Taliban agreed to let female students pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians are granted visas to accompany them. But the Taliban, who seized power of Afghanistan in 2021, denied Monday that they reached any 'conditional agreement' regarding the scholarships. The Taliban have 'no agreement with Pakistan or any other country regarding scholarships for girls. ... Such unfounded claims are propaganda by certain malicious groups against the Islamic Emirate,' said a statement posted on the Taliban's Ministry of Higher Education website. The Taliban banned women from traveling long distances without a chaperone, working with the government and nongovernment organizations, and going to public baths, beauty salons and public parks. Pakistan's Higher Education Commission said the scholarships aim to 'strengthen [the] bilateral relationship' between the two countries. Salih said these scholarships offer Afghan women hope. 'We want to be a beacon of hope for those still in Afghanistan,' said Salih, adding that 'even in tough times and with many limitations, there is always hope and a path forward.'

China's DeepSeek AI rattles Wall Street, but questions remain	Chinese researchers backed by a Hangzhou-based hedge fund recently released a new version of a large language model (LLM) called DeepSeek-R1 that rivals the capabilities of the most advanced U.S.-built products but reportedly does so with fewer computing resources and at much lower cost. High Flyer, the hedge fund that backs DeepSeek, said that the model nearly matches the performance of LLMs built by U.S. firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta, but does so using only about 2,000 older generation computer chips manufactured by U.S.-based industry leader Nvidia while costing only about $6 million worth of computing power to train. By comparison, Meta’s AI system, Llama, uses about 16,000 chips, and reportedly costs Meta vastly more money to train. Open-source model The apparent advance in Chinese AI capabilities comes after years of efforts by the U.S. government to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them. Over the past two years, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. put multiple export control measures in place with the specific aim of throttling China’s progress on AI development. DeepSeek appears to have innovated its way to some of its success, developing new and more efficient algorithms that allow the chips in the system to communicate with each other more effectively, thereby improving performance. At least some of what DeepSeek R1’s developers did to improve its performance is visible to observers outside the company, because the model is open source, meaning that the algorithms it uses to answer queries are public. Market reaction The news about DeepSeek’s capabilities sparked a broad sell-off of technology stocks on U.S. markets on Monday, as investors began to question whether U.S. companies’ well-publicized plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data centers and other infrastructure would preserve their dominance in the field. When the markets closed on Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by 3.1%, and Nvidia’s share price had plummeted by nearly 17%. However, not all AI experts believe the markets’ reaction to the release of DeepSeek R1 is justified, or that the claims about the model’s development should be taken at face value. Mel Morris, CEO of U.K.-based Corpora.ai, an AI research engine, told VOA that while DeepSeek is an impressive piece of technology, he believes the market reaction has been excessive and that more information is needed to accurately judge the impact DeepSeek will have on the AI market. 'There's always an overreaction to things, and there is today, so let's just step back and analyze what we're seeing here,' Morris said. 'Firstly, we have no real understanding of exactly what the cost was or the time scale involved in building this product. We just don't know. … They claim that it's significantly cheaper and more efficient, but we have no proof of that.' Morris said that while DeepSeek’s performance may be comparable to that of OpenAI products, 'I've not seen anything yet that convinces me that they've actually cracked the quantum step in the cost of operating these sorts of models.' Doubts about origins Lennart Heim, a data scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA that while it is plain that DeepSeek R1 benefits from innovative algorithms that boost its performance, he agreed that the general public actually knows relatively little about how the underlying technology was developed. Heim said that it is unclear whether the $6 million training cost cited by High Flyer actually covers the whole of the company’s expenditures — including personnel, training data costs and other factors — or is just an estimate of what a final training 'run' would have cost in terms of raw computing power. If the latter, Heim said, the figure is comparable to the costs incurred by better U.S. models. He also questioned the assertion that DeepSeek was developed with only 2,000 chips. In a blog post written over the weekend, he noted that the company is believed to have existing operations with tens of thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used to do the work necessary to develop a model that is capable of running on just 2,000. 'This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving their models to customers,' he wrote. He also pointed out that the company’s decision to release version R1 of its LLM last week — on the heels of the inauguration of a new U.S. president — appeared political in nature. He said that it was 'clearly intended to rattle the public’s confidence in the United States’ AI leadership during a pivotal moment in U.S. policy.' Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, was also cautious about declaring that DeepSeek R1 has somehow upended the AI landscape. 'I think Silicon Valley and Wall Street are overreacting to some extent,' he told VOA. 'But at the end of the day, R1 means that the competition between the U.S. and China is likely to remain fierce, and that we need to take it seriously.' Export control debate The apparent success of DeepSeek has been used as evidence by some experts to suggest that the export controls put in place under the Biden administration may not have had the intended effects. 'At a minimum, this suggests that U.S. approaches to AI and export controls may not be as effective as proponents claim,' Paul Triolo, a partner with DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told VOA. 'The availability of very good but not cutting-edge GPUs — for example, that a company like DeepSeek can optimize for specific training and inference workloads — suggests that the focus of export controls on the most advanced hardware and models may be misplaced,' Triolo said. 'That said, it remains unclear how DeepSeek will be able to keep pace with global leaders such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta and others that will continue to have access to the best hardware systems.' Other experts, however, argued that export controls have simply not been in place long enough to show results. Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown’s University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology told VOA that it would be 'very premature' to call the measures a failure. 'The CEO of DeepSeek has gone on record saying the biggest constraint they face is access to high-level compute resources,' Bresnick said. 'If [DeepSeek] had as much compute at their fingertips as Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc, there would be a significant boost in their performance. So … I don't think that DeepSeek is the smoking gun that some people are claiming it is [to show that export controls] do not work.' Bresnick noted that the toughest export controls were imposed in only 2023, meaning that their effects may just be starting to be felt. He said that the real test of their effectiveness will be whether U.S. firms are able to continue to outpace China in coming years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-deepseek-ai-rattles-wall-street-but-questions-remain-/7952661.html	2025-01-27T17:42:45-08:00	
Survivors, world leaders mark 80th anniversary of Auschwitz death camp liberation	Around 50 survivors joined world leaders Monday at the site of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland, on the 80th anniversary of its liberation in World War II – marked around the world as International Holocaust Memorial Day.

CDC ordered to stop working with WHO immediately	NEW YORK — U.S. public health officials have been told to stop working with the World Health Organization, effective immediately. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, John Nkengasong, sent a memo to senior leaders at the agency on Sunday night telling them that all staff who work with the WHO must immediately stop their collaborations and 'await further guidance.' Experts said the sudden stoppage was a surprise and would set back work on investigating and trying to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus and mpox in Africa, as well as brewing global threats. It also comes as health authorities around the world are monitoring bird flu outbreaks among U.S. livestock. The Associated Press viewed a copy of Nkengasong's memo, which said the stop-work policy applied to 'all CDC staff engaging with WHO through technical working groups, coordinating centers, advisory boards, cooperative agreements or other means — in person or virtual.' It also says CDC staff are not allowed to visit WHO offices. President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from WHO, but that did not take immediate effect. Leaving WHO requires the approval of Congress and that the U.S. meets its financial obligations for the current fiscal year. The U.S. also must provide a one-year notice. His administration also told federal health agencies to stop most communications with the public through at least the end of the month. 'Stopping communications and meetings with WHO is a big problem,' said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert who collaborates with WHO on work against sexually transmitted infections. 'People thought there would be a slow withdrawal. This has really caught everyone with their pants down,' said Klausner, who said he learned of it from someone at CDC. 'Talking to WHO is a two-way street,' he added, noting that the two agencies benefit from each other's expertise. The collaboration allows the U.S. to learn about new tests, new treatments and emerging outbreaks — information 'which can help us protect Americans abroad and at home,' Klausner said. The CDC details nearly 30 people to WHO and sends many millions of dollars to it through cooperative agreements. The U.S. agency also has some of the world's leading experts in infectious diseases and public health threats, and the two agencies' staffers are in daily contact about health dangers and how to stop them. The collaboration halt isn't the only global health effect of Trump's executive orders. Last week, the president froze spending on another critical program, PEPFAR or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The anti-HIV program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. It was included in a Trump administration freeze on foreign aid spending slated to last at least three months. PEPFAR provides HIV medication to more than 20 million people 'and stopping its funding essentially stops their HIV treatment,' International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement. 'If that happens, people are going to die and HIV will resurge.' A U.S. health official confirmed that the CDC was stopping its work with WHO. The person was not authorized to talk about the memo and spoke on condition of anonymity. A WHO spokesperson referred questions about the withdrawal to U.S. officials. Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. And CDC officials didn't respond to the AP's request to speak with Nkengasong about the memo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-ordered-to-stop-working-with-who-immediately/7952673.html	2025-01-27T17:23:39-08:00	
Google Maps to rename 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' for US users	WASHINGTON — Google Maps will change the name of 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' once it is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System, it said in an X post on Monday. The change will be visible in the U.S., but it will remain 'Gulf of Mexico' in Mexico. Outside of the two countries, users will see both names. The Trump administration's Interior Department said on Friday it had officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and the Alaskan peak Denali to Mount McKinley. Google Maps, which is owned by Alphabet's Google, will make a similar change with Mount McKinley. President Donald Trump ordered the name changes as part of a flurry of executive actions hours after taking office last Monday, making good on a campaign promise. 'As directed by the President, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America and North America's highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley,' the Interior Department said in a statement last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-maps-to-rename-gulf-of-mexico-to-gulf-of-america-for-us-users/7952630.html	2025-01-27T16:35:18-08:00	
Full-scale replica of Anne Frank's hidden annex opens in New York City	NEW YORK — A full-scale replica of the secret annex where Anne Frank penned her famous diary opened in New York City on Monday as the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The exhibit at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan represents the first time the annex has been completely recreated outside of Amsterdam, where the space is a central part of the Anne Frank House museum. But while the original annex has been intentionally left empty, the New York reconstruction shows the five rooms as they would have looked while the Frank family and others lived in hiding. The spaces are filled with furniture and possessions, including a reconstruction of the writing desk where Frank wrote her diary. Ronald Leopold, director of the Anne Frank House, said furnishing the recreated space was important to tell Anne's story in a new and immersive way, especially for those who may not get to visit the Amsterdam museum, which also houses Frank’s original diary. 'We very much hope that we will be able to touch people’s hearts here, because education is the focus of this exhibition,' Leopold said at Monday's opening. 'And education starts with empathy — empathy with what happened here, what happened in Amsterdam during those years, what was done to Anne Frank.' The Frank family hid with other Jews for two years in the attic of patriarch Otto Frank’s office in Amsterdam as the Nazi German army occupied the Netherlands during World War II. They were eventually discovered in 1944 and sent to concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was liberated by Soviet troops 80 years ago Monday. Anne and her older sister Margot died of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Their father, Otto, was the only person from the annex to survive the Holocaust. After the war, he published his 15-year-old daughter’s diary, which is considered one of the most important works of the 20th century. Frank died in 1980 at the age of 91. Hannah-Milena Elias, the granddaughter of Anne Frank’s cousin, Buddy Elias, said she found it emotional walking through the exhibit rooms. 'It is quite overwhelming and quite touching to see what a tiny space the families had to stay in and live for more than two years,' said the 29-year-old, who lives in Switzerland. Her sister, Leyv-Anouk Elias, hoped the exhibit would encourage visitors to reflect on what it means to face discrimination or be a minority today. 'History, unfortunately, is repeating itself in different ways,' the 27-year-old Berlin resident said. 'We have to be very, very careful how to act and to do stuff against it, to not ever make this happen again.' The New York exhibit, which runs through April 30, spans more than 696 square meters (7,500 square feet) and includes more than 100 photos and other artifacts — many never before displayed publicly, according to officials. Among the items are Anne Frank’s first photo album and her handwritten poetry, as well as a replica of her famous diary. There are also nearly 80 translated editions of her diary and even the Oscar won by Shelley Winters for the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. The installation is presented chronologically, tracing the Frank family's life in Germany through the rise of the Nazi regime, the family’s flight to Amsterdam and their life in hiding and eventual capture. Henry Byrne, a junior at Xavier, a Catholic high school in Manhattan, said learning about the family's saga helped him grasp the enormity of the Holocaust. 'It taught me a lot about how just because you see one story, walk into these rooms and all the beds and the tables, that’s just one person’s life,' the 16-year-old said. 'And there were millions that were lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/full-scale-replica-of-anne-frank-s-hidden-annex-opens-in-new-york-city/7952619.html	2025-01-27T16:18:01-08:00

VOA Mandarin: What is Stargate? Is China catching up in AI?	The multibillion-dollar Stargate Project announced by U.S. President Donald Trump will focus on building data centers with the goal of turning the U.S. into a computing power empire, according to experts. Some believe the significant boost in U.S. computational capabilities will widen the gap with China in artificial intelligence. 'And this is an industrial buildout that, at least right now, China really is not in a position to do because of the [semiconductor] export controls that the United States is placing,' said Dean W.

Belarusian opposition, Western leaders denounce Lukashenko's reelection	Belarus’ opposition activists and Western officials have denounced the reelection of Alexander Lukashenko to serve his seventh five-year presidential term. The 70-year-old leader began his iron-fisted rule in 1994. He received nearly 87% of the ballots cast in Sunday’s election in the Eastern European country, according to the Belarus Central Election Commission. His victory was not surprising as he has imprisoned many of his opponents, while others have fled abroad to live in exile. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya labeled Lukashenko’s successful reelection as 'sheer nonsense.' Before Sunday’s vote, she had encouraged voters to cross out every candidate’s name on the ballot. The four challengers in Sunday’s election had all praised Lukashenko’s leadership, according to The Associated Press. The European Union, Britain, Australia and New Zealand issued a joint statement condemning 'the sham presidential elections in Belarus and the country’s human rights violations under Lukashenko.' Britain’s Foreign Office said Monday that it has sanctioned six Belarus citizens and three defense sector firms, after the Sunday polls in Belarus. The sanctioned individuals include the head of the Belarusian Central Election Commission and two prison chiefs. 'Following Lukashenko's brutal crackdown in which critical voices within Belarus have been silenced, yesterday's sham election failed to meet international standards and has been condemned by international partners,' the Foreign Office said. The Foreign Office also said that the sanctions were being placed in coordination with Canada. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement, 'The world has become well-accustomed to Lukashenko's cynical pretense of democracy in Belarus, while in reality he brutally represses civil society and opposition voices to strengthen his grip on power.' Lukashenko's successful presidential bid in 2020 set off months of protests in which thousands of people were beaten and more than 65,000 were arrested. He was roundly condemned by the West, which imposed sanctions. However, he survived the protests with the help of his close ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Lukashenko depends on for subsidies, as well as political support. Putin called Lukashenko Monday to congratulate him on his 'convincing victory.' Chinese President Xi Jinping also congratulated the Belarusian leader. The Viasna Human Rights Center, an exiled Belarusian nongovernmental organization, said in a statement that Belarus has over 1,250 political prisoners in custody. Some information in this story was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarusian-opposition-western-leaders-denounce-lukashenko-s-reelection/7952376.html	2025-01-27T16:02:14-08:00	
Scott Bessent wins Senate confirmation as US Treasury secretary	The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed Scott Bessent to be President Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, giving the billionaire hedge fund manager a central role in shaping the new administration's policy ambitions around tax cuts and spending and managing economic relationships with allies and adversaries alike. As the 79th Treasury secretary, Bessent will have sway over the nation's tax collections and its $28 trillion Treasury debt market, with vast influence over fiscal policy, financial regulations, international sanctions and investments from overseas. The vote was 68-29, with 16 Democrats supporting the nomination. Bessent, 62, is already shaping up to be a forceful advocate for Trump's economic agenda, which centers on reducing taxes and imposing steep tariffs that Democrats, and some economists, argue could undo some of the progress the Federal Reserve has made in getting inflation under control. In his confirmation hearing, Bessent warned that failure to renew $4 trillion in tax cuts expiring at the end of this year would be a 'calamity' for middle-class Americans, and made the case that tariffs would help combat unfair trade practices, increase revenues, and bolster U.S. leverage in international negotiations. He also pushed back against the idea that Trump's policies would be inflationary, and said that the administration's efforts to increase oil production would actually help bring down prices. As Trump's top economic official, Bessent will face a range of challenges, the most immediate of which will be managing federal cash flows after the government hit its statutory debt limit on Trump's second day in office. Even before he was sworn in, the Treasury Department was using 'extraordinary measures' to avoid breaching the cap and triggering a catastrophic default. Bessent told senators in his confirmation hearing that there would be no default on his watch. Bessent will also need to deal with the prospect of rising budget deficits and added government debt estimated to run into the trillions of dollars, if tax cut extensions and other promised tax breaks cannot be offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. If precedent holds, he will be a central actor working with Congress on the size and shape of any tax reforms. More than 60% of the federal debt is scheduled to roll over on his watch — and that's before taking into account issuance growth that has been running at more than $2 trillion a year since the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Out of control' Worries about rising budget deficits and stickier inflation have in recent weeks sent long-term bond yields up as investors demand more compensation for risk. That in turn has driven up the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to more than 7%, a pain point with saliency for Americans looking to buy a home. Bessent used his confirmation hearing to talk tough on deficits, declaring that government spending is 'out of control,' though it is not clear how much he could do to rein it in. He backed Trump's pledge not to touch the Social Security retirement program and Medicare insurance plan for seniors, among the biggest line items in the federal budget, along with interest expense, determined by market rates that the Treasury does not control. Born and raised in South Carolina, Bessent says he still listens to farm radio. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Yale University and has spent his career in finance, working for investors George Soros and Jim Chanos, and running his own firm Key Square. Bessent — as fifth in line to the presidency — is also the highest ranking openly gay federal official in history. He is married with two children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scott-bessent-wins-senate-confirmation-as-us-treasury-secretary/7952378.html	2025-01-27T16:01:15-08:00

Earthquake rattles houses in Maine, felt as far away as Pennsylvania	SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A 3.8-magnitude earthquake centered near the Maine coast rattled houses in northern New England on Monday and was felt by surprised residents of states hundreds of miles away. The earthquake took place at about 10:22 a.m. Monday and was centered about six miles (10 kilometers) southeast of York Harbor in southern Maine, the United States Geological Survey reported. It was reported at a depth of about eight miles (13 kilometers) the survey said. Officials said the quake could be felt in every state in New England and as far away as Pennsylvania. In southern Maine, many residents reported feeling houses and buildings shake as the surprising earthquake interrupted a sunny winter morning. The quake sent residents and officials in Maine and New Hampshire looking to assess any possible damage. In most cases, residents and businesses reported confusion over what had happened. Many shared stories on social media indicating they initially thought there may have been a nearby car accident or possibly an explosion. The Maine Emergency Management Agency asked residents to only call 911 in the event of an emergency. The earthquake did not appear to cause any major damage, said Vanessa Corson, a spokesperson for the agency. Corson also said local emergency management agencies did not report any damage. New Hampshire’s Department of Safety said the state's 911 number did not receive any calls about damage or injuries. 'We have not received word of any issues. We’ve spoken with the directors at York and Cumberland County EMA, and everything seems to be in order,' Corson said. Justine Wenger, a freelance copywriter working from her Scarborough home, said she was texting with a friend when she felt the earthquake. The vibrations lasted about 30 seconds and shook her house. At first, she thought it was a passing truck, then feared her furnace might blow up so she went out onto her deck. 'I wasn’t terrified, but this felt different than a normal rumbling,' she said. 'It felt substantial. There was an instinct to get out of the house.' Authorities said residents who felt the earthquake could report it to the USGS website. Earthquakes in the center and eastern parts of the U.S. are less frequent than in western states, but they are typically felt over a much broader region, the survey said on its website. It’s common for there to be two small earthquakes a year in New England, the survey said. A slightly stronger earthquake based in New Jersey shook the Northeast in April. 'People in New England, and in its geological extension southward through Long Island, have felt small earthquakes and suffered damage from infrequent larger ones since colonial times,' according to the survey’s website. An earthquake of close to 4.0 or slightly higher in magnitude in the Northeast states 'is not particularly common, but it’s not all that rare, either,' said Maureen Long, the chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Yale University. Long cited the April earthquake in New Jersey as an example. A 2002 earthquake in upstate New York was measured at a magnitude of 5.1. There was also a magnitude 4.7 event near Hollis Center, Maine, in 2012, Long said. Residents of cities including Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, also reported feeling the quake. In Kennebunk, Maine, school superintendent Terri Cooper assured parents via e-mail that staff was looking through schools for any damage and everything seemed fine. 'Our operations department has checked all district buildings and systems to ensure they are in working order and no damage has been discovered,' Cooper’s e-mail said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-rattles-houses-in-maine-felt-as-far-away-as-pennsylvania/7952380.html	2025-01-27T15:56:32-08:00

Serbian farmers join striking university students' 24-hour traffic blockade in Belgrade	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbia's striking university students on Monday launched a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the capital, Belgrade, stepping up pressure on the populist authorities over a deadly canopy collapse in November that killed 15 people. Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability of the deadly accident in the northern city of Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption. A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the populist government's firm grip on power in Serbia. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, later on Monday urged dialogue with the students, saying, 'We need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.' Students in the past have refused to meet with Vucic, saying the president is not entitled by the constitution to hold talks with them. 'Any kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy,' said Vucic. 'Such a situation in society is not good for anyone.' Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. He has accused the students of working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government. Several incidents have marked the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming into the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured. Traffic police on Monday secured the student blockade to help avoid any similar incidents. Protesting students set up tents at the protest site, which is a key artery for the city commuters and toward the main north-south motorway. Some students played volleyball, others sat down on blankets on the pavement or walked around on a warm day. The students also held a daily 15-minute commemoration silence at 11:52, the exact time when the canopy at a train station in Novi Sad crashed on Nov. 1. Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy fell because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. Serbia's prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister, Goran Vesic, has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation's independence. The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-farmers-join-striking-university-students-24-hour-traffic-blockade-in-belgrade/7952334.html	2025-01-27T15:24:29-08:00

Hundreds of US visa appointments canceled in Colombia following spat with Trump over deportations	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — Visa appointments at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia were canceled Monday following a dispute between President Donald Trump and his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro over deportation flights from the U.S. that nearly turned into a costly trade war between the two countries. Dozens of Colombians arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota and were handed letters by local staff that said their appointments had been canceled 'due to the Colombian government's refusal to accept repatriation flights of Colombian nationals' over the weekend. Later on Monday, Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the government was sending a Colombian Air Force plane to San Diego to pick up a group of Colombians who were on a deportation flight that was not allowed to land on Sunday morning. The victory claimed in Washington turned Colombia into an example of what other nations could face if they stand in the way of Trump's illegal immigration crackdown. It also put on display a clash with a leftist leader of a country that had long been a U.S. partner against drug trafficking. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Monday the Trump administration will take action if countries do not abide by their agreements, such as accepting deportees. 'This was about reminding Colombia that there is a price to pay if you go against your agreements, things that you promise,' she said in an interview on Fox News' 'The Story.' 'Ultimately, what one would expect to happen did happen. They said, 'Oh, our bad,' and they reversed everything.' Colombians, like most non-U.S. citizens, require a visa to travel to the United States for tourism, business or other purposes. But in Colombia, it can take up to two years to get a visa appointment at the U.S Embassy in Bogota, which has also been handling visa requests from neighboring Venezuela for several years. Those who had their Monday appointments canceled will likely have to wait several months for a new appointment. And many said they were frustrated with the unexpected cancellations. 'President Petro did not represent our interests,' said Elio Camelo, a U.S. visa seeker from the city of Cali who had traveled to Bogota for his appointment. 'There is a lot of uncertainty now over what will happen next,' said Mauricio Manrique, who had his Monday morning appointment canceled. He had traveled from Popayan, about 600 kilometers (about 370 miles) south of Bogota, for his appointment. Tensions between Colombia and the United States escalated Sunday after Petro wrote an early morning message on X saying he would not allow two U.S. Air Force planes carrying Colombian deportees to land in the country. Petro also shared a video that showed another group of deportees reportedly arriving in Brazil with shackles on their legs. He said Colombia would only accept deportation flights when the United States had established protocols that ensured the 'dignified treatment' of expelled migrants. Trump responded with a post of his own on Truth Social, in which he called for 25% emergency tariffs on Colombian exports to the United States and also said that the U.S. visas of Colombian government officials would be revoked, while goods coming from the South American country would face enhanced customs inspections. Meanwhile, the State Department said Sunday it would stop issuing visas to Colombian nationals until deportation flights resumed. Tensions decreased Sunday night following negotiations between the countries, with the White House saying in a statement that Colombia had allowed the resumption of deportation flights and 'agreed to all of President Trump's terms,' including the arrival of deportees on military flights. Last year, Colombia accepted 124 deportation flights. But those were charter flights organized by U.S. government contractors. The White House said tariffs on Colombian exports would be put on hold but added that visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced custom inspections would remain 'until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.' The State Department has not responded to requests for comment on the resumption of visa appointments. Last year, more than 1.6 million Colombians traveled to the U.S. legally, according to a report by the Ministry of Commerce. The report said the United States was the top destination for Colombians traveling abroad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-us-visa-appointments-canceled-in-colombia-following-spat-with-trump-over-deportations/7952343.html	2025-01-27T15:16:04-08:00	
Woman gets more than 3-year prison term in ‘US birthright tourism’ case	Los Angeles — A California woman was sentenced Monday to more than 3 years in prison in a long-running case over a business that helped pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States to deliver babies who automatically became American citizens. U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave Phoebe Dong a 41-month sentence and ordered her immediately taken into custody from his federal court in Los Angeles. Dong and her husband were convicted in September of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy Baby. The sentencing came as birthright citizenship has been thrust into the spotlight in the United States with the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. Since taking office, Trump issued an executive order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship, a move quickly blocked by a federal judge who called it 'blatantly unconstitutional.' Dong and her husband, Michael Liu, were among more than a dozen people charged in an Obama-era crackdown on so-called 'birth tourism' schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies while traveling to the United States to give birth. Such businesses have long operated in various states catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria and elsewhere. Under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is an American citizen. Many have seen these trips as a way to help their children secure a U.S. college education and a better future — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent residency once the children turn 21. During her sentencing hearing, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled growing up without siblings due to China’s strict 'one-child' policy and told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an abortion. Moving to the United States was challenging, she said, but Dong grew hopeful after having children of her own and saw she could help Chinese women who want to have additional children in California. 'I don’t want to lose my kids,' she told the court. 'I hope you can give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.' Federal prosecutors sought a more than five-year sentence for Dong and argued that she and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States. They said the pair worked with others to coach women on how to trick customs officials by flying into airports believed to be more lax while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide their pregnancies. 'For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous customers deceive U.S. authorities and buy U.S. citizenship for their children,' prosecutors said in court filings. They declined to comment after the sentencing. In December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong's lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term after Liu completes his sentence because of their three children. The youngest is 13. Federal prosecutor Kevin Fu agreed to the delay, but Klausner refused and had her taken into custody immediately. Dong removed a necklace and gave it to a family member before she was led away. The USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader probe into businesses that helped Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The operator of another business is believed to have fled to China, McNicholas wrote in court filings, while another was sentenced in 2019 to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa fraud for running the company known as 'You Win USA.' McNicholas said he feels Dong was given a much longer sentence because the government and Klausner blame her for the babies that were born U.S. citizens. That, he said, is unrelated to the allegations that she and Liu helped women travel to the United States to give birth. 'Our position was these children are born in America. They’re citizens,' McNicholas said, adding that Dong will appeal. 'Implicitly, he’s saying being born here is not enough.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/woman-gets-more-than-3-year-prison-term-in-us-birthright-tourism-case/7952350.html	2025-01-27T15:13:41-08:00	
Pakistani journalists fear amended cybercrime law will further curb freedoms	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is pressing ahead with amendments to its digital crimes act to stem what it says is an influx of fake news. But media rights groups warn the changes, if passed, will suppress freedom of expression by exposing journalists and social media users to legal action. New amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (2025), commonly known as PECA, call for a three-year prison term and a fine of over $7,000 for spreading fake and false information. The amendments also broaden the definition of content that authorities can block and set up four new bodies to regulate online content. The amended law now awaits passage in the Senate after its Standing Committee on Interior approved the amendments Monday. The National Assembly, the lower house of the country’s bicameral parliament, passed the amended bill last Thursday as opposition members and journalists walked out in protest. 'The fact that [the] interior ministry is involved in this clearly shows that this is being turned into a national security matter,' said Nayyar Ali, secretary of the National Press Club that represents journalists in Islamabad and neighboring Rawalpindi. The law Originally promulgated as Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (2016), PECA, as it is commonly known, was meant to curb cybercrime, online harassment, and the spread of hateful content that could instigate violence. Media and human rights groups call the law 'draconian' and say successive governments have used it to muzzle dissent. Press freedom groups have recorded more than 200 incidents of journalists and media persons investigated since PECA became law in 2017. The latest changes to the law come just days before Pakistan marks a year since its elections last Feb. 8 were marred by allegations of widespread fraud. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan, one of the most popular leaders, remains in jail and his party is deprived of its share of seats reserved for women and minorities. However, his supporters continue to run a formidable online campaign when most TV channels avoid saying the leader’s name. 'State and private players have been able to tame mainstream media,' said journalist Arifa Noor about the decline in press freedom over the past several years. 'It has pushed a considerable amount of the commentary and reporting onto social media, and this is why they now want to go after social media. 'They can’t tame it and they want to tame it,' she said. Pakistan ranks a low 152 out of 180 countries on Reporters without Borders' global press freedom index, where 1 shows the best media environment. Freedom House ranks it 'not free' for internet freedoms. Amendments PECA (2025) as approved by the national assembly expands the definition of unlawful content to include information that is false, harmful, and damages the reputation of a person including members of the judiciary, armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly. It also broadens the definition of 'person' to include state institutions and corporations. Critics worry this will muzzle dissent and open doors for the powerful military to target civilians. Minister for Information for Punjab province Azma Bukhari rejected the concerns as 'undue.' 'The [military] institution also belongs to this country,' he said. 'If the institution has an objection over someone, should it not object [just] because it’s an institution?' The amendments come as Pakistan’s military routinely faces criticism online for its role in civilian affairs as well as for its alleged interference in political affairs, which it denies. Faced often with smear campaigns, the military’s top brass has repeatedly called for a crackdown on 'digital terrorism.' 'What we need is strong civil laws that treat defamation as a civil problem,' Noor said. The amended law stipulates a punishment of up to three years in prison and a fine of more than $7,000 for intentionally disseminating information that a person knows or believes is 'false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest in general public or society.' 'What is fake news? They don’t bother to define it,' Noor, the journalist, said. 'They want to call everything that they don’t like fake news.' Journalists’ bodies say the impact of the amended law will not be limited to social media content makers. 'All the media is digital now,' said Ali, secretary of the National Press Club, as mainstream media outlets and prominent journalists use social media to deliver information that can draw state backlash if delivered on TV channels. New powers The bill proposes creating a Digital Rights Protection Authority, a Social Media Complaint Council, a Social Media Protection Tribunal and a National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority. Decisions made by the tribunal can only be challenged in the Supreme Court, bypassing the traditional appeals process that includes provincial high courts. Punjab information minister Bukhari defended the amendment saying, 'we are giving access to the highest forum in the country.' However, the Press Club’s Ali said most citizens do not have the financial means to approach the country’s top court through lawyers. Bukhari, who has been a target of an AI-generated smear campaign, told VOA that Pakistan needs such a law. 'Those who deal in fake news should be fearful of this law,' she said. 'Those who file with checks and balances should not worry.' However, Noor said journalists are also caught in a bind when government officials give contradictory information that causes the spread of false information. Rushed passage Some journalists’ bodies have said they support government efforts to regulate digital spaces, however they are questioning the speedy passage of the amended law in the National Assembly and approval of amendments by the Senate committee. Expressing concern over the chilling effects of the amendments, the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan as well as Amnesty International last week called on the government to consult journalist bodies before turning the bill into law. In a statement Thursday, the Joint Action Committee, a coalition of major media bodies of the country 'rejected any PECA amendments that are passed or approved without consultation with media bodies.' The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has called for nationwide protests on Tuesday afternoon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-journalists-fear-amended-cybercrime-law-will-further-curb-freedoms-/7952337.html	2025-01-27T14:56:09-08:00	
Auschwitz liberation at 80: Survivors, world leaders mark milestone	LONDON — Around 50 survivors and dozens of world leaders attended memorial events at the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland on Monday to mark the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Soviet Red Army in World War II. January 27 is marked around the world as International Holocaust Memorial Day. Six million people were killed in the Holocaust as the Nazis attempted to eliminate the Jewish race. In front of the so-called 'Death Gate,' through which more than a million Jews and other prisoners were led to their deaths, the survivors gathered in a heated tent, joined by heads of state and delegates from across the world. They lit candles and laid wreaths of remembrance for the estimated 1.1 million people who perished at the camp. Tova Friedman, who was 2 years old when she was taken to the camp at Auschwitz, is the youngest of the survivors. 'We were victims in a moral vacuum,' she told delegates. 'But today, however, we have an obligation not only to remember, which is very, very important, but also to warn and to teach that hatred only begets more hatred.' Auschwitz liberation On Jan. 27, 1945, Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz, the largest of the six Nazi extermination camps. What they found continues to haunt humanity. Industrial-scale human slaughter spread across a vast factory complex of dormitories, gas chambers, crematoria and mass graves — the apparatus of a regime determined to wipe out the entire Jewish race. A genocide conducted over 4-and-a-half years, planned and executed with meticulous detail. It was part of the Nazis’ 'final solution to the Jewish problem' — a strategy of mass murder agreed at the Wannsee Conference in 1942. An estimated 1.1 million people were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, around 960,000 of them Jews. Poles, Roma, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners of war and other nationalities were also murdered in the thousands. Victims were stripped of their clothing and forced into packed chambers filled with cyanide-based Zyklon-B gas. By summer 1944, an estimated 12,000 people a day were being gassed to death. Thousands of others were shot or beaten to death or died from disease, starvation and exposure. Bodies were burned or buried in mass graves. 'Burning bodies' Janina Iwanska was taken to Auschwitz by train from another Polish transit camp in August 1944 at age 14. 'As soon as I got off the wagon, I was immediately hit by the smell, the one I knew from Treblinka [concentration camp] — the smell of burning bodies,' she told Reuters. 'There were small children there who were brought with their mothers. After leaving the ‘disinfection’ room, they were separated, torn off them. The mothers almost ripped the hands of these children off because they did not want to let them go. Besides, some of the children could not recognize their mothers, because not only were the clothes different but also the heads. A shaved head and a head with hair are two completely different heads,' Iwanska said. As Red Army troops approached the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp from the east, Nazi soldiers attempted to cover up their crimes. Around 60,000 prisoners were forcibly transferred in so-called 'death marches' to other camps farther west. It’s estimated that up to 15,000 died along the way. By the time the Russian troops entered Auschwitz, around 7,000 prisoners remained, most on the brink of death. Thousands died before receiving medical help. ‘Culture of remembrance’ Germany now embraces 'Erinnerungskultur,' an official 'culture of remembrance,' or a duty to take responsibility for the Holocaust. 'We keep alive the memory of the breach of civilization committed by Germans in the Holocaust and convey it to every generation in our country again and again. Our responsibility never ends,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said ahead of the anniversary. But the 80th anniversary comes amid growing fears over the rise of the far-right in Germany, Europe and beyond. Such concerns were voiced by many Auschwitz survivors, including Leon Weintraub, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and now lives in Sweden. 'Be attentive and be vigilant,' Weintraub told delegates. 'We, the survivors, we understand that the consequences of being considered different is active persecution, the effects of which we have personally experienced on our own skin. So, let us be very serious, and let us take seriously what the enemies of democracy preach. They generally seek to implement these slogans they promote,' he said. German fears The German government has repeatedly warned of the dangers of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Party, which is polling in second place, or around 20%, ahead of February elections. The AfD is being monitored by German intelligence services as a potentially 'extremist' party. In a recent televised conversation with Elon Musk, the U.S. billionaire and ally of President Donald Trump, AfD’s leader Alice Weidel said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was not right-wing but a 'communist.' Speaking at an AfD conference Saturday by video link, Musk, who is an open supporter of the party, questioned Germany’s approach to its past. 'I think there’s frankly too much of a focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that. Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents or even let alone their parents, the great-grandparents, maybe even,' Musk said. Israel conflict The Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and the brutal Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, have overshadowed memorial events in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not attend the Auschwitz commemorations. Netanyahu faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for suspected war crimes committed during Israel’s war on Hamas, which he strongly denies. The United States, a close ally of Israel, has condemned the warrant and threatened sanctions against the court in The Hague. Poland assured Netanyahu that he would not be arrested if he attended the Auschwitz memorial events. However, the Israeli prime minister instead spent Monday in a Tel Aviv court as his long-running corruption trial resumed. Israel was instead represented by Education Minister Yoav Kisch. Relatives of the dozens of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza traveled to Poland for the Auschwitz liberation anniversary, while survivors of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre joined survivors of the Holocaust for commemorative events in Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/auschwitz-liberation-at-80-survivors-world-leaders-mark-milestone/7952314.html	2025-01-27T14:26:23-08:00	
Fight for control of major Congolese city 'ongoing,' says UN official	UNITED NATIONS — A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of the Congo said Monday that fighting between Rwandan-backed rebels and the Congolese army for an important provincial capital in the country’s east is 'not over yet,' despite claims by the rebels to have captured the city of Goma. 'Fighting is still very much ongoing,' said Bruno Lemarquis, U.N. resident coordinator in the DRC. 'It's a very, very fluid situation. It's a very dangerous situation.' He told reporters via a video call from DRC’s capital, Kinshasa, that 'active zones of combat have spread to all quarters' of Goma in North Kivu province. Lemarquis said there have been severe disruptions to water, electricity, internet and phone service. Humanitarian warehouses have been looted. In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. says the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province. The United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior U.N. officials are calling for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. 'On behalf of the humanitarian community, I call on all parties to agree on temporary humanitarian pauses in the most affected areas and establish humanitarian corridors to ensure humanitarian activities resume at scale. And more importantly, also to facilitate the safe evacuation of wounded individuals and civilians trapped in combat zones,' Lemarquis added. The United Nations announced Sunday a $17 million disbursement from its central emergency fund for urgent humanitarian needs in DRC. Lemarquis said nonessential U.N. staff, foreign and Congolese, are being temporarily evacuated from Goma to either Kinshasa or to a U.N. base in Entebbe in neighboring Uganda. The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels’ advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery. 'At this critical juncture now, the onus really is and has to be about bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities,' U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters on the same video call, speaking from Damascus, Syria, where he is on a mission. 'The fate of the millions of civilians living in Goma or having been displaced is really the priority, along with the safety and security of U.N. personnel,' he said. In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict. Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country’s valuable mineral deposits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fight-for-control-of-major-congolese-city-ongoing-says-un-official/7952272.html	2025-01-27T13:36:09-08:00

Rwanda, Congo presidents to meet as rebels take Goma, Kenya's leader says	GOMA, CONGO — Kenyan President William Ruto said Monday that the presidents of Rwanda and Congo have agreed to attend a meeting Wednesday to discuss developments in eastern Congo, where M23 rebels say they have seized control of Goma on the Congo-Rwandan border. 'We are all in agreement that now more than ever it is an existential issue, not just for the people of eastern DRC, but for this region,' Ruto said during a press briefing, referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo, also called Congo. 'The situation in eastern DRC now demands our collective focus.' The apparent takeover of Goma, a city of about 2 million, has prompted fears of further violence and mass displacement. A journalist in Goma told VOA by telephone that fighting was now going on around the city’s airport, and that it appeared to be escalating. While he was speaking, gunfire could be heard in the background, and he cut off the call to seek shelter. For years, Congo has repeatedly accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels — an accusation Kigali denies. The Congo government said Monday that Rwandan government troops are in Goma. There was no immediate response from officials in Kigali. The Congolese government 'continues to work to avoid carnage and loss of human life,' said government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya in a Monday post on X. Muyaya said that the government is urging Goma residents to stay indoors and refrain from looting. M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka told VOA that the rebel group took control of the city over the weekend after intense clashes with Congo government forces. The violence around the city has sparked widespread panic among its residents and displaced people, many of whom had already fled violence in surrounding areas. Mugunga, one of the largest camps for displaced people near Goma, is experiencing a flurry of new arrivals. 'We fled Sake last year because of fighting, and now we are running again,' said one woman who declined to be named for security reasons. 'We have no food, no shelter, and no idea where we’ll end up. This is no life.' As the rebels fight to take full control of Goma, the situation remains fluid in nearby Sake, a key town west of the city in North Kivu province. Reports indicate that fierce fighting continues between M23 and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, known by its French acronym FARDC. On Friday, General Sylvain Ekenge, a Congo military spokesperson, announced the death of North Kivu Governor Major General Peter Cirimwami. The spokesperson said on state media that the governor was 'wounded and evacuated to Kinshasa, where all efforts were made to take him abroad for appropriate care. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his wounds.' Humanitarian needs deepen The conflict has exacerbated the region’s already dire humanitarian situation. The United Nations reports that over 5.5 million people are displaced in Congo, many of them in North Kivu. People like Lomoo Biondo Manuel, an internally displaced person, want the violence to stop. We are facing 'a lot of hardships,' Manuel told VOA’s Swahili Service. 'We want to go back to our original homes. We want peace.' In Mugunga camp, residents have been forced to seek shelter in schools, abandoned buildings, and even open fields. One displaced woman pleaded for immediate intervention, saying, 'We call on the government to end this war so we can return to our homes.' The M23’s resurgence has drawn renewed scrutiny of regional actors. A recent United Nations report said that Rwanda has played a direct role in M23’s operations, a charge that Rwandan officials have dismissed as baseless.

EU renews sanctions against Russia, eases them on Syria	PARIS — European Union foreign ministers agreed Monday to continue sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, but to ease some sanctions against Syria following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad. Weeks of stalling by Hungary ended Monday, allowing the EU to renew sanctions against Russia for another six months. But in return, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban — considered close to Moscow — is pushing for Ukraine to reopen a gas pipeline to central Europe after letting a transit deal expire. The bloc also earmarked aid for Moldova’s energy needs, which Europe says are threatened by Russia. The 27-member bloc moved in the opposite direction when it came to Syria — agreeing to scale up humanitarian aid and ease some sanctions, now that the country is under new leadership. 'This could give a boost to the Syrian economy and help the country get back on its feet,' said Kaja Kallas, EU’s foreign policy chief. Syria’s foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, has called the EU’s move a 'positive step.' European foreign ministers also discussed a raft of other thorny issues, from the Gaza ceasefire to Iran and the conflict in eastern Congo. Another key topic: relations with the new Trump administration. 'As the United States shifts to [a] more transactional approach, Europe needs to close ranks. We are stronger when we are united — that was a view that everybody shared,' Kallas said. She described Washington as Europe’s closest ally, but tensions have surfaced over trade, military spending and Greenland, after President Donald Trump indicated he wanted to acquire the territory. 'We are not negotiating on Greenland,' Kallas said. 'Of course, we are supporting our member state, Denmark, and its autonomous region, Greenland.' Kallas also noted the many ways the EU and U.S. are interlinked. But she said Europe needs to take into account its own strengths, in discussions with partners as well as with adversaries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-renews-sanctions-against-russia-eases-them-on-syria/7952186.html	2025-01-27T12:39:38-08:00	
UN special envoy in Zambia to assess freedom of expression	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — A United Nations special rapporteur is on a 10-day visit to Zambia to assess accusations that the government is stifling dissent. According to the U.N., Irene Khan will also focus on Zambia’s legal and policy framework and the safety of journalists, activists and human rights defenders in the country. Upon her arrival in Lusaka on Friday, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion told journalists that her visit to Zambia will give her the chance to hear from all sides and make recommendations. 'I can also discuss … recent developments or legislative developments, other issues of how to strengthen your government’s commitment to human rights, especially freedom of opinion and expression,' Khan said. In May of last year, police in Zambia arrested two opposition lawmakers, two opposition party leaders and an activist on espionage charges. This followed their accusation that the government played a role in the alleged abduction of an independent lawmaker, Emmanuel Jay Jay Banda. The government has denied that accusation. Meanwhile, Zambian journalist Thomas Zgambo has been arrested three times in 13 months after writing articles critical of the government. He is facing sedition charges. And last August, the government warned it would tighten cybersecurity laws to curb online hate speech, propaganda and defamation. The ruling party later withdrew the bill after it was denounced by human rights groups. Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mulambo Haimbe, told VOA that his government has nothing to hide and invited the special rapporteur to Zambia. Haimbe defended his government’s record on human rights, saying it has upheld rights guaranteed in the Zambian constitution. 'We have Article 11, which protects the freedoms of individuals, protection of fundamental rights of individuals. And in particular, with regard to freedom of expression, Article 20 is very clear that all citizens and all persons in Zambia will enjoy an inalienable right to the freedom of expression and opinion,' he said. Chishala Kateka, leader of the opposition New Heritage Party, told VOA that Khan’s visit is very timely. 'We are experiencing arbitrary arrests and transfer of individuals to distant provinces without due process,' she said. 'There’s also a systematic denial of our right to assemble and express ourselves freely. We have selective application of the law where opposition members are unfairly targeted while those from the ruling party are above the law.' Juliet Chibuta, a human rights activist, told VOA the visit of the U.N. special rapporteur is an opportunity to hear from both sides and offer solutions. 'The special rapporteur will offer an independent scrutiny and provide unbiased analysis of the situation on the ground, as she is not affiliated to any institution in Zambia. Her visit will also raise awareness on issues regarding censorship, harassment of journalists, restrictions on online expression and other threats of freedom of speech,' Chibuta said. In August, U.N. experts expressed concern about the allegations of arbitrary arrests of political opponents in Zambia. The experts said the arrests and restrictions in Zambia have had a chilling effect on freedom of opinion, expression, association and assembly, which are critical for a functioning democracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-special-envoy-in-zambia-to-assess-freedom-of-expression/7952115.html	2025-01-27T12:16:15-08:00	
Zimbabwe's war veterans demand President Mnangagwa's resignation	Harare, Zimbabwe — A group of Zimbabwe’s liberation war veterans has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down. The veterans, affiliated with the ruling Zanu-PF Party, accuse the president of nepotism, corruption and failing to address the moribund economy. Zanu-PF Party leaders say they are not taking the calls seriously. At a press conference streamed online, Blessed Runesu Geza, a veteran of Zimbabwe’s 1960s and ’70s liberation war and a member of Zanu-PF's central committee, called for the president to step down immediately. He accused Mnangagwa of failing to live up to the promises he made in 2017 when he came to power with the army's help. Geza said many of those who died fighting for the country’s liberation do not have decent graves and that the country is being turned into 'a banana republic.' He also spoke of looting and the struggles of people in the country. 'We are saying — as war veterans — enough is enough. You have shown that you have failed. It can’t get any worse,' he said in Shona at the press conference. 'Corruption has become a security threat because these people are being protected by Emmerson. So, as war veterans, including masses, we are being asked, ‘Why did you give us this kind of a person? We no longer like him.’ So, we are pleading with you: Leave peacefully. If you don’t, people will use the constitution for you to go.' In an interview with VOA, Zanu-PF spokesman Farai Marapira dismissed the calls for Mnangagwa to step down. 'The party position is clear; the party position is given to clear channels. So, we cannot dignify rogue rantings by responding to them,' Marapira said. 'People who speak their mind outside of the party, that's part of democracy. But the position is clear: We had a conference, and that is what we will deal with, and that is what we work with, and anything else is just ranting.' At a recent Zanu-PF conference, party leaders passed a resolution that Mnangagwa should seek a third term in 2028, assuming the party can force through amendments to the constitution. In an interview with VOA, Eldred Masunungure, a political professor at the University of Zimbabwe, said the war veterans are feeling genuine frustration, as things have not worked out the way they expected after Mnangagwa toppled Robert Mugabe in November 2017. 'The political clouds are extremely difficult to read under the circumstances, but what is clear [is] they expressed in unambiguous terms their exasperation with the way things have been going on in the last couple of years in the second republic,' Masunungure said. 'That is certain. But the outcome of what they are doing, what they are advocating for, that is — in my view — deeply uncertain.' The second republic refers to Mnangagwa’s presidency after Mugabe’s 37 years in power. Brighton Chipamhadze, a Harare-based independent political commentator, said Geza’s announcement shows the divisions within the ruling party. 'As Comrade Geza points out, there are certain individuals benefiting from Mnangagwa’s rule, calling for [an] extension of Mnangagwa’s term,' Chipamhadze said. 'Yet there is also a section of the ruling party which is against Mnangagwa extending his term of office.' Zimbabwe’s constitution, adopted in 2013, allows parliament to impeach and remove the president if lawmakers feel he is incapacitated. Mnangagwa is one of Africa’s oldest heads of state. In 2028, he will be 86 years old.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-s-war-veterans-demand-president-mnangagwa-resignation/7952114.html	2025-01-27T12:05:58-08:00	
Trump's sanctions could force Russia's Putin to negotiating table, some experts say	WASHINGTON — On Jan. 22, Donald Trump — just two days after being inaugurated for his second term as U.S. president — again called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the 'ridiculous' war with Ukraine, but this time he added a threat. 'If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,' Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. The following day, Trump told reporters that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he’s ready to negotiate an end to the war. In an interview with Fox News aired that same day, Trump said Zelenskyy is 'no angel' and 'shouldn't have allowed this war to happen.' Does the new U.S. administration have sufficient economic leverage over Russia to force it to make peace, or at least talk about peace? According to Konstantin Sonin, John Dewey distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and former vice rector of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics, the U.S. has economic leverage, but some of its levers are clearly weaker than others. 'Russia's trade with the U.S. is very small — less than $3 billion a year,' he told Danila Galperovich of VOA’s Russian Service. 'Accordingly, even if any opportunity for U.S. companies to trade with Russia is completely closed, the damage to Russia will be small. There is an opportunity to strengthen secondary sanctions — that is, additional pressure, first of all, on China, on India, on other countries, so that they more strictly comply with the primary sanctions. 'There is also an opportunity to continue what [former U.S. President Joe] Biden did with sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet,' Sonin added, referring to vessels that Russia uses to sell oil and evade Western sanctions. 'This requires great international cooperation, but, in principle, it can be done,' said Sonin. Economist Vladislav Inozemtsev, a special adviser to the Russian Media Studies Project at MEMRI, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and director of the Moscow-based Center for Post-Industrial Studies, also stressed the significance of secondary sanctions on countries that do business with Russia. 'Trump can somehow influence other countries so that they do not buy Russian products,' Inozemtsev told VOA. 'For example, let's say he can say that if India buys Russian oil, then the United States will impose 15% duties on all goods from India. This would have the most radical consequences. [I]f… countries trading with Russia are getting serious problems in the United States for all their products, then I think that this will be a very sobering moment. If it is possible to impose a virtually complete trade blockade through U.S. sanctions, then these will be devastating sanctions, of course.' Sonin said that, over the longer term, deregulating oil production internationally would reduce world oil prices and thereby hinder Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations against Ukraine. 'Trump is famous for his good relations with Saudi Arabia, although they are unlikely to be so good that they will reduce oil prices at his request,' he said. 'But nevertheless, it is possible to work towards lowering oil prices, which even without sanctions will reduce Russian income.' Trump spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a Jan. 22 telephone call. Still, Sonin said that economic levers, in and of themselves, cannot force Putin to do anything. 'I would say that the most direct impact is still the supply of more powerful weapons to Ukraine. I do not know to what extent Trump wants to do this, but he mentioned it, and, in principle, it is possible to supply Ukraine with more powerful weapons in larger quantities.' Inozemtsev, however, said that Putin, who has not previously changed his behavior in response to ultimatums, could do so this time. 'Trump is a person whose degree of radicalism and unpredictability corresponds to Putin's,' he said. 'Here, perhaps, it would be better for Putin to change his mind a bit. If Trump offers him: 'Vladimir, let's go, we'll meet there, sit down at the negotiating table, bring your team, I'll bring mine, and we'll agree on something, we'll discuss it for a day or two, but the issue needs to be resolved,' I think Putin will go.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sanctions-could-force-russia-putin-to-negotiating-table-some-experts-say/7952066.html	2025-01-27T11:49:56-08:00	
Egypt, Jordan reject Trump proposal to resettle Palestinian refugees	CAIRO — Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal over the weekend to resettle residents of the Gaza Strip in Egypt or Jordan. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the Egyptian government supports 'the Palestinian people's insistence to remain on their land, defending their legitimate rights and respecting international law.' Egyptian public opinion remains firmly opposed to the resettlement of Palestinians on Egyptian territory. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi recently told a crowd of military officers that it would be easy to resettle some Palestinians in the Sinai, but the difficulty would be getting anyone in Egypt to accept the idea. Khattar Abou Diab, who teaches political science at the University of Paris, told VOA that despite the difficult economic situation in Egypt and the fact that there could be a significant economic windfall in accepting Trump's proposal to resettle some Palestinians in the country, a large segment of the Egyptian public would refuse to do so. Paul Sullivan, a former professor at the American University of Cairo and fellow at the Atlantic Council, agreed, telling VOA that such a proposal is unacceptable to Egyptians. 'No Egyptian leader who wants to stay in power would agree to such a request,' he said. 'It would destabilize Egypt and likely lead to greater regional instability.' Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also rejected Trump's proposal, saying that 'Palestine is for the Palestinians and Jordan is for the Jordanians and that the solution to the Palestinian problem is located on Palestinian soil and embodied by a Palestinian state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/egypt-jordan-reject-trump-proposal-to-resettle-palestinian-refugees-/7951964.html	2025-01-27T10:28:15-08:00	
Flood victims rescued by boat as Storm Herminia hits northern France	RENNES, FRANCE — Residents in western France used boats to escape their flooded homes Monday as rivers and waterways broke their banks after successive storms battered Normandy and Brittany. The national weather service had issued flood and wind warnings as Storm Herminia hit Spain, France on parts of the U.K. Normandy and Brittany were already waterlogged after the passage of last week's Storm Éowyn — which left two people dead from fallen trees and more than 1 million people without electricity in Ireland and Britain. Storm Herminia caused road closures in some areas of France. About 400 people were evacuated from homes in and around the city of Rennes, at the heart of the hardest-hit region. The mayor called it the city's worst flooding in more than 40 years and said in a statement that the waters weren't expected to start receding until Wednesday. A 73-year-old British sailor was reported missing off the Atlantic coast near Bordeaux over the weekend, according to the regional maritime authority. France's weather service issued further flood and wind warnings for Tuesday for all regions on the western coast, from Brittany down to the Spanish border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/flood-victims-rescued-by-boat-as-storm-herminia-hits-northern-france-/7951953.html	2025-01-27T10:26:34-08:00	
Taliban caution US against bounty threats over alleged American detainees	ISLAMABAD — A diplomat from Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban cautioned the United States on Monday against threatening retaliatory measures in response to detentions of U.S. nationals in the country. 'Our policy is to reach a solution through peaceful means,' Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban ambassador to Qatar, told VOA in written remarks. He spoke two days after the new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened that Washington may place a 'very big bounty' on Taliban leaders, suggesting they might hold more American hostages in the country than previously known. Last week, the de facto Afghan authorities released two Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, in exchange for a Taliban member serving a life sentence in a U.S. federal prison on drug and terrorism charges. The swap was negotiated by former President Joe Biden’s administration. 'In the face of pressure and aggression, the jihad [holy war] of the Afghan nation in recent decades is a lesson that everyone should learn from,' Shaheen stated. The Taliban have not revealed how many foreigners are still in their custody in Afghanistan. However, relatives and U.S. officials report the detention of at least two additional Americans. They are George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio wrote on social media platform X on Saturday. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden.' The chief U.S. diplomat did not elaborate or specify the number of Americans being detained in Afghanistan. Washington offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden for planning the deadly Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States. Congress subsequently authorized the secretary of state to increase the bounty to a maximum of $50 million. U.S. forces searched for bin Laden in Afghanistan for years before finding his hideout and killing him in neighboring Pakistan in 2011. Meanwhile, a former Canadian soldier detained by the Taliban was freed Sunday after more than two months of imprisonment in a deal brokered by Qatar. 'I just spoke with David Lavery upon his safe arrival in Qatar from Afghanistan. He is in good spirits,' Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly announced on X. Joly credited the tiny Gulf nation’s prime minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani with helping in Lavery’s release. 'Thank you to my Qatari counterpart, @MBA_AlThani_, for helping facilitate the release of our Canadian citizen,' she wrote. The Taliban waged a lethal insurgency in Afghanistan that persisted for nearly two decades, ultimately regaining power in 2021, mere days before a hasty and chaotic withdrawal of all U.S.-led Western troops from the country along with thousands of Afghan allies. Taliban leaders have since imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, banning girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade, prohibiting most women from workplaces, and blocking women’s access to public life at large. The United Nations has designated the restrictions as 'gender apartheid,' and the international community has refuted the Taliban’s request for legitimacy to their government due to their severe treatment of the female Afghan population. The restrictions stem from numerous decrees issued by the reclusive Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, from his base in the southern city of Kandahar, with his aides defending the government as in line with Sharia. Last week, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague announced that he had applied for arrest warrants for Akhundzada and Afghanistan’s chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, accusing them of persecuting women and girls. The Taliban rejected the allegations as baseless and condemned the arrest warrants for their leaders as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-caution-us-against-bounty-threats-over-alleged-american-detainees/7951874.html	2025-01-27T09:21:34-08:00	
New US defense secretary promises agility, accountability	Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promised more changes are coming to the country’s military before even walking through the doors of the Pentagon. Hegseth, a decorated veteran and a former Fox News host, was greeted just outside the Pentagon by General Charles Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after arriving for his first full day of work. Hegseth said serving as defense secretary was the honor of a lifetime, telling reporters that the Defense Department will operate at a faster tempo. 'The lawful orders of the president of the United States will be executed inside this Defense Department swiftly and without excuse,' Hegseth said. 'We're going to hold people accountable.' Hegseth won Senate confirmation late Friday by a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking ballot. He was sworn in on Saturday and spoke Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in what the Pentagon described as an 'introductory call.' 'We will be no better friend to our allies and no stronger adversary to those who want to test us and try us,' Hegseth told reporters Monday before entering the Pentagon. He said that President Donald Trump is expected to sign additional executive orders on Monday impacting the military, including orders calling for a U.S. version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, the removal of all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives from the Pentagon, and the reinstatement of troops forced to leave the military after refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccination. Hegseth also said the Pentagon will make sure Trump has all the resources needed to secure the U.S. southern border. 'Whatever is needed at the border will be provided,' the defense secretary said. 'This is a shift. It's not the way business has been done in the past.' 'The Defense Department will support the defense of the territorial integrity of the United States of America, the southern border, to include reservists, National Guard and active duty in compliance with the Constitution and the laws of our land and the directives of the commander in chief,' he added. Asked about the fate of Afghans who worked alongside the United States before the U.S. withdrawal in August 2021, Hegseth said, 'We’re going to make sure there's accountability for what happened in Afghanistan and that we stand by our allies.' Hegseth also deflected questions about whether he plans to fire the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. 'I'm standing with him right now,' Hegseth said. 'I look forward to working with him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-us-defense-secretary-promises-agility-accountability/7951867.html	2025-01-27T09:15:05-08:00	
Relief group pulls workers out of DRC's Goma as M23 rebels advance	Nairobi, Kenya — Amid fighting between M23 rebels and government forces in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, some organizations are relocating staff because they no longer feel safe. This comes after the reportedly Rwandan-backed rebels said over the weekend they had taken control of Goma, the biggest city in the region. Rose Tchwenko, the DRC’s country director for Mercy Corps, told VOA that since last week, the humanitarian group has closely monitored the situation as government forces and M23 clashed in and around Goma, a city of around 2 million people. 'From Wednesday last week, with the fall of Minova, followed by the fall of Sake, which are key supply routes into Goma, the situation looked a little bit more dire with the imminent takeover or incursion into Goma itself by the rebel forces,' she said. 'We made some decisions, first to move out non-essential staff, pull back our teams from the ground where it was no longer safe to continue to provide humanitarian services.' But that changed quickly, as the situation grew more unstable in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, which is on the border with Rwanda. 'On Sunday with the escalation of the conflict around Goma, we had to pull out even the senior team into Gisenyi (across the border in Rwanda) so that we can continue to operate and provide the necessary support to our teams across the country,' she said. She told VOA the situation was dire. 'As of yesterday, we know that the airport in Goma is closed and under M23 control,' she said. 'We have heard reports of sporadic fighting throughout the center of Goma city. Some of us on this side of the border could actually [hear] gunshots at some point during the night. We are aware of M23 presence in Goma but still uncertain of what the actual situation is.' As M23 rebels last week made advances into Goma, three U.N. peacekeepers died and seven South African soldiers and three from Malawi, serving in a separate Southern African Development Community mission, also were killed, according to U.N. and South African officials. At an emergency meeting on Sunday, the United Nations Security Council called for an end to the hostilities. Bintou Keita, the head of the U.N. mission in Congo, addressed the Council via video link, painting a bleak picture. 'Roads are blocked and the airport can no longer be used for evacuation or humanitarian efforts,' he said. 'M23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed. In other words, we are trapped.' Jack Mongi, a Goma resident who sent VOA an audio message in French via WhatsApp, said that fighting was still going on around the airport. 'As I speak, you can hear gunshots, we are under our mattresses, under our beds and if you listen, you can hear the gunshots....' The Congolese minister of foreign affairs told the U.N. Security Council that this is 'a frontal assault, a declaration of war.' VOA reached out to the Rwandan government for comment but has not immediately heard back. Many countries represented at the special Security Council meeting condemned the attacks, including the acting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Dorothy Shea, who called for a ceasefire. 'The United States will consider all the tools at its disposal in order to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining armed conflict, instability and insecurity,' she said. In Nairobi, Kenya's President William Ruto said he spoke to both Congolese and Rwanda presidents and called for an 'immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities.' Ruto, who’s also the chair of the East African Community, says he’ll be convening an extraordinary EAC summit in coming days to try to chart a way forward in this crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/relief-group-pulls-workers-out-of-drc-s-goma-as-m23-rebels-advance/7951757.html	2025-01-27T07:56:25-08:00

Civilians at increased risk as M23 rebels capture DRC's Goma, rights advocates warn	Nairobi, Kenya — Human Rights Watch is expressing concern about civilians in the eastern Congolese city of Goma now that M23 rebels have taken control of the city. Fighting between M23 and Democratic Republic of the Congo forces has displaced 400,000 since the start of this year, according to the United Nations. Goma’s capture by the rebel group further threatens civilian lives and could cause more displacement, the rights group said. Residents of Goma in eastern DR Congo shared videos Monday of M23 rebels patrolling the city, with some cheering as the fighters walked through the streets. Blaise Karege is a Congolese political and security researcher in eastern Congo. He said the rebel group has been received well, and the reasons for the ongoing conflict have changed. 'The residents are singing in the streets, and they are behind the rebel group,' he said. 'I don't know if all of that is for the love, or fear, of M23. I cannot tell. Previous conflicts were much about politics, but today, the conflict has a more tribal dimension, too, and today, it appears M23 has a lot of support.' The M23 rebel group launched an offensive to seize Goma several weeks ago, taking areas closest to the border with Rwanda, which is widely believed to support M23 — something the Kigali government denies. The Congolese army and its allied militias, Wazalendo, have fled the city, according to local reports. The U.N. mission in Goma said it has received some men in Congolese uniforms and some in plain clothes who handed over their weapons. Human Rights Watch said it's now concerned about the safety of Goma civilians, many of whom fled to the city to escape violence and abuse from eastern Congo’s many armed groups, including M23. Clementine de Montjoye, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, said concerns of rights groups and NGOs for civilians are at an all-time high. 'We have documented extensively how they have executed people,' she said. 'There have been cases of rapes, gang rapes, arbitrary detention, and extortion, and last night, we heard reports of looting inside Goma by the Wazalendo armed group. At the same time, M23 also has a long history of committing abuses against civilian populations, and since the resurgence of M23 ... we have documented how they have executed people they accuse of supporting the Congolese army or Congolese government.' M23 says it is fighting to protect communities who have faced abuse and attacks from the Congolese army and other militia groups. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has called on M23 to end hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories in eastern Congo. Karege said the group won't be vacating the city that easily. 'Today, they say they are not going to leave the city because they are protecting their parents and children,' he said. 'But this is going to give them a certificate to speak and engage with the government in Kinshasa so that they can resolve this issue without conflict. Leaving Goma, Masisi, and Ruchuru won't happen,' he said, referring to other population centers in the region. M23 first captured Goma in 2012 but agreed to leave after signing a peace agreement with the Congolese government. The fighters launched a new offensive in 2021, accusing the Congolese government of failing to honor the peace agreement from eight years before. The government in Kinshasa insists the group must disarm before any negotiations can take place.	https://www.voanews.com/a/civilians-at-increased-risk-as-m23-rebels-capture-drc-goma-rights-advocates-warn/7951639.html	2025-01-27T06:12:57-08:00	
DeepSeek's 'Sputnik moment' prompts investors to sell big AI players	LONDON/SINGAPORE — Investors hammered technology stocks on Monday, sending the likes of Nvidia and Oracle plummeting, as the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model cast doubts on Western companies' dominance in this sector. Startup DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players' models, possibly marking a turning point in the level of investment needed for AI. Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid almost 4%, suggesting the index could see its biggest daily slide since September 2022 later on Monday, if those losses are sustained. Those on the S&P 500 dropped 2%. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia fell more than 11%, rival Oracle dropped 8.5% and AI data analytics company Palantir lost 6.5% in pre-market trading. DeepSeek, which by Monday had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in terms of downloads on the Apple Store, offers the prospect of a viable, cheaper AI alternative which has raised questions about the sustainability of the level of spending and investment on AI by Western companies, including Apple and Microsoft. From Tokyo to Amsterdam, shares in AI players tumbled. 'We still don’t know the details and nothing has been 100% confirmed in regards to the claims, but if there truly has been a breakthrough in the cost to train models from $100 million+ to this alleged $6 million number this is actually very positive for productivity and AI end users as cost is obviously much lower meaning lower cost of access,' Jon Withaar, a senior portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management, said. The hype around AI has powered a huge inflow of capital into the equity markets in the last 18 months in particular, as investors have bought into the technology, inflating company valuations and sending stock markets to record highs. Little is known about the small Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek. Its researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 model, launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million - the figure referenced by Pictet's Withaar. H800 chips are not top-of-the-line. Initially developed as a reduced-capability product to get around restrictions on sales to China, they were subsequently banned by U.S. sanctions. 'Sputnik moment' Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek's R1 model was AI's 'Sputnik moment,' referencing the former Soviet Union's launch of a satellite that marked the start of the space race in the late 1950s. 'Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world,' he said in a separate post. In Europe, ASML which counts Taiwan's TSMC, Intel and Samsung as its customers, dropped almost 7.5%, while Siemens Energy lost nearly 18%. In Japan, startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%. Last week it announced a $19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-center joint venture with OpenAI. Given the volatility, investors sought out safe-havens such as U.S. Treasuries, which pushed 10-year yields down nearly 10 basis points to 4.52%, while low-yielding currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc soared against the dollar. Big Tech has ramped up spending on developing AI capabilities and optimism over the possible returns has driven stock valuations sky-high. Nvidia alone has risen by over 200% in about 18 months and trades at 56 times the value of its earnings, compared with a 53% rise in the Nasdaq .IXIC, which trades at a multiple of 16 to the value of its constituents' earnings, according to LSEG data. Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore said the market was questioning the capex spend of the major tech companies. Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management said: 'The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies in America, like Nvidia and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally, there's concern that this perspective might start to change.' 'I think it might be a bit premature,' Ichikawa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deepseek-s-sputnik-moment-prompts-investors-to-sell-big-ai-players-/7951643.html	2025-01-27T06:11:47-08:00	
US M113 armored personnel carriers prove crucial to Ukraine's fighting forces	Part of a U.S. military aid package to Ukraine in April 2022, the M113 armored personnel carrier has proved vital in conducting assault operations and providing protection for Ukrainian infantry.

Saving sorghum: The push to reclaim Southern Africa’s native grain	Climate change is making it harder for African farmers to grow the continent’s staple crop, maize.

Reporting from Johannesburg, Zaheer Cassim explores the benefits of sorghum and why this indigenous African grain is disappearing from grocery shelves.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saving-sorghum-the-push-to-reclaim-southern-africa-s-native-grain-/7951588.html	2025-01-27T05:31:03-08:00	
Chinese and Indian diplomats call for warmer relations but make no public mention of border dispute	BEIJING — The top diplomats of China and India called for their nations to provide further mutual support but avoided publicly mentioning a long-standing border dispute in the Himalayas when they met Monday in Beijing. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told top Indian foreign affairs official Vikram Misri that the sides 'should seize the opportunity, meet each other halfway, explore more substantive measures, and strive to understand, support and achieve each other, rather than be suspicious of, alienate and consume each other,' China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. It cited Misri as saying the nuclear-armed Asian giants have 'properly managed and resolved differences and promoted the restart of practical cooperation in various fields.' Ties have been stable since the leaders of the two countries met last year on the sidelines of a multinational summit in Russia. Days before that meeting, India announced the two sides had agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a spike in tensions that began with a deadly clash in 2020. That turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi have since limited their joint public comments to pleasantries without openly discussing the border. India said the 2024 agreement would lead to the 'disengagement' of troops at the Line of Actual Control, the long shared border in the Himalayas, although it's unclear whether that meant the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed along their disputed border in the Ladakh region. The Line of Actual Control separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India's eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. India and China fought a deadly war over the border in 1962. Both India and China have withdrawn troops from face-off sites on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but they maintain extra troops at Demchok and Depsang Plains. The army standoff damaged business ties between the two nations with halted investments from Chinese firms and major projects banned. India also banned Chinese-owned apps, including TikTok, which is operated by Chinese internet firm Bytedance. It cited privacy concerns that it said threatened India's sovereignty and security. Chinese products are ubiquitous in India, from toys to smartphones to made-in-China Hindu idols. According to Indian government data, two-way trade has grown by the tens of billions in the past two decades, with the balance strongly favoring China, while China has drawn many Indian specialists and students, particularly in the medical field.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-and-indian-diplomats-call-for-warmer-relations-but-make-no-public-mention-of-border-dispute-/7951523.html	2025-01-27T04:27:31-08:00	
Sweden intercepts Bulgarian ship over damaged Baltic cable	Sofia, Bulgaria — The Swedish coast guard chased and intercepted a Bulgarian ship after a fiber-optic cable under the Baltic Sea linking Sweden to Latvia was damaged, its owner said on Monday. Latvia sent a warship on Sunday to investigate the damage, while Swedish prosecutors opened an 'aggravated sabotage' investigation. Nations around the Baltic Sea have scrambled to bolster defenses after the suspected sabotage of undersea cables in recent months, with some observers blaming Russia. The Bulgarian vessel on Sunday 'was chased by the Swedish coast guard with instructions for the ship to go into their territorial waters and it is now on anchor where an investigation ... is ongoing,' Alexander Kalchev, CEO of Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar), owner of the Vezhen, told AFP. He denied involvement in any sabotage. 'I am convinced that we cannot say ... that this was a malicious act,' he added. The Malta-flagged vessel carrying fertilizer from Ust-Luga in Russia and headed for South America was sailing in 'extremely bad weather' on Saturday based on the information given to him by the crew, Kalchev said. An inspection on Sunday found that 'one of the ship's anchors was damaged and the anchor had dropped into the sea, which means that it was possible that it had dragged along the sea floor,' he said, adding the anchor was then pulled up. 'Full solidarity' Navibulgar, Bulgaria's biggest shipping company, said it had appointed an agent in Sweden and hired a lawyer 'to defend the interests of the crew and the company.' The ship, constructed in 2022, has a crew of eight Bulgarians and nine Myanmar nationals. 'Staff from the Swedish authorities have been on board the ship since yesterday evening to carry out investigative measures,' an intelligence official told AFP. The damage to the cable occurred in Swedish territorial waters at a depth of at least 50 meters, officials said. The cable belongs to Latvia's state radio and television center (LVRTC) which said in a statement that there had been 'disruptions in data transmission services.' The company said alternatives had been found and end users would mostly not be affected although 'there may be delays in data transmission speeds.' Latvia's navy on Sunday said it had identified a 'suspect vessel,' the Michalis San, near the location of the incident along with two other ships. Prime Minister Evika Silina said Riga had notified the Swedish authorities and that the two countries were working together on the incident. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed he had been in contact with Silina during the day, and Sweden, Latvia and NATO are closely cooperating on the matter. Experts and politicians have accused Russia of orchestrating a hybrid war against the West as the two sides square off over Ukraine. NATO this month announced it was launching a new monitoring mission in the Baltic Sea involving ships and aircraft to deter attempts to target undersea infrastructure. European Union President Ursula von der Leyen expressed 'full solidarity' with countries affected by the incident. 'The resilience and security of our critical infrastructure is a top priority,' von der Leyen wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-intercepts-bulgarian-ship-over-damaged-baltic-cable/7951464.html	2025-01-27T04:15:38-08:00	
Ukraine says Russian drone attacks hit infrastructure in several regions	Russian drone attacks damaged infrastructure sites in western, central and eastern Ukraine on Monday. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 57 of the 108 total drones that Russian forces launched overnight. The intercepts took place over the Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Officials in Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk and Sumy said drone attacks hit 'critical infrastructure.' Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak also said on Telegram that Russian shelling Monday injured at least five people in the city of Nikopol. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 32 Ukrainian drones, including intercepts over Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk, Oryol and Tver. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that a Ukrainian drone attack damaged a house, but did not hurt anyone. A Kremlin spokesperson said Monday that Russia had not received any signals about a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. The comment came days after Putin said he and Trump should discuss the war in Ukraine as well as energy prices.

Palestinians return to Gaza City amid Israel-Hamas ceasefire	Palestinians began arriving back in Gaza City early Monday, as Israeli forces opened checkpoints and allowed people back into northern areas that had been closed off since the early days of Israel’s war against Hamas. Thousands of people, mostly on foot, were on the roads to Gaza City, which has seen largescale destruction during Israeli ground operations and airstrikes that the military said were aimed at destroying the militant group. Gaza City is one of many areas that came under Israeli evacuation orders, leaving people scrambling to find a safe place amid the war. Many of the evacuees were displaced multiple times and turned to tent camps for shelter. The Palestinians’ return to Gaza City comes amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has also included the release of some hostages held in Gaza, freeing Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. A last-minute dispute about the late release of an Israeli hostage delayed access, but Qatar announced early Monday an agreement under which Hamas will free Arbel Yehoud and two other hostages before Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed the agreement, saying an additional three hostages also will be released Saturday and that Hamas had provided a list with the status of all the hostages who are due to be released during this first phase of the ceasefire. There was violence Sunday in central Gaza as Israeli forces fired at Palestinians along a coastal road near a checkpoint, killing at least one person and injuring 18 others, according to a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat. The Israeli military said in a statement that it 'identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat.' The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 47,300 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 100 hostages, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during a six-week truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Seven Israeli hostages and nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners have been freed thus far. Violence Sunday also put pressure on a separate ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 22 were killed and 124 others injured as Israel confirmed it would not meet a 60-day deadline to withdraw its troops as part of the ceasefire it reached with Hezbollah in November. On Sunday, the White House released a statement that the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, would continue to be in effect until Feb. 18. 'The Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after October 7, 2023,' the statement said. Israel blamed the militants and the Lebanese army for failing to meet their own commitments under the truce. The Israeli military said that it fired 'warning shots' toward 'suspects' and that it had detained an unspecified number of people. Under terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat to the north away from the Israeli border and Israel was to pull out of Lebanon. In a statement, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned that it was 'imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.' It urged the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese people to adhere to the directives of the Lebanese military. 'Further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation,' the statement said.

Belarus strongman wins a 7th term in an election the opposition calls a farce	The smiling face of President Alexander Lukashenko gazed out from campaign posters across Belarus on Sunday as the country held an orchestrated election virtually guaranteed to give the 70-year-old autocrat yet another term on top of his three decades in power. 'Needed!' the posters proclaim beneath a photo of Lukashenko, his hands clasped together. The phrase is what groups of voters responded in campaign videos after supposedly being asked if they wanted him to serve again. And according to a nighttime statement by the Central Election Commission, the strongman leader won by a landslide, garnering nearly 87% percent of the vote. But his opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, would disagree. They call the election a sham — much like the last one in 2020 that triggered months of protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people. The crackdown saw more than 65,000 arrests, with thousands beaten, bringing condemnation and sanctions from the West. His iron-fisted rule since 1994 — Lukashenko took office two years after the demise of the Soviet Union — earned him the nickname of 'Europe’s Last Dictator,' relying on subsidies and political support from close ally Russia. He let Moscow use his territory to invade Ukraine in 2022, and even hosts some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons, but he still campaigned with the slogan 'Peace and security,' arguing he has saved Belarus from being drawn into war. 'It’s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,' Lukashenko said in his characteristic bluntness. Fearing a repeat of election unrest His reliance on support from Russian President Vladimir Putin — himself in office for a quarter-century — helped him survive the 2020 protests. Observers believe Lukashenko feared a repeat of those mass demonstrations amid economic troubles and the fighting in Ukraine, and so scheduled the vote in January, when few would want to fill the streets again, rather than in August. He faces only token opposition. According to official results, announced in the early hours of Monday, Lukashenko won 86.82% of the vote - compared to his nearest rival's 3.21%. According to the Central Election Commission, 3.60% of voters spoiled their ballots. In 2020, the electoral body claimed Lukashenko had taken 80.10% of the vote. 'The trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option, when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,' Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said. Lukashenko repeatedly declared that he wasn’t clinging to power and would 'quietly and calmly hand it over to the new generation.' His 20-year-old son, Nikolai, traveled the country, giving interviews, signing autographs and playing piano at campaign events. His father hasn’t mentioned his own health, even though he was seen having difficulty walking and occasionally spoke in a hoarse voice. 'The successor issue only becomes relevant when a leader prepares to step down. But Lukashenko isn’t going to leave,' Karbalevich said. Top political opponents imprisoned or exiled Leading opponents have fled abroad or were thrown in prison. The country holds nearly 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center. Since July, Lukashenko has pardoned more than 250 people. At the same time, authorities have sought to uproot dissent by arresting hundreds more in raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners. Authorities detained 188 people last month alone, Viasna said. Activists and those who donated money to opposition groups have been summoned by police and forced to sign papers saying they were warned against participating in unsanctioned demonstrations, rights advocates said. Lukashenko's four challengers on the ballot are all loyal to him. 'I’m entering the race not against, but together with Lukashenko, and I’m ready to serve as his vanguard,' said Communist Party candidate Sergei Syrankov, who came in second place. He favors criminalizing LGBTQ+ activities and rebuilding monuments to Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Candidate Alexander Khizhnyak, head of the Republican Party of Labor and Justice, led a voting precinct in Minsk in 2020 and vowed to prevent a 'repeat of disturbances.' Oleg Gaidukevich, head of the Liberal Democratic Party, supported Lukashenko in 2020 and urged fellow candidates to 'make Lukashenko’s enemies nauseous.' The fourth challenger, Hanna Kanapatskaya, managed 1.7% of the vote in 2020 and says she's the 'only democratic alternative to Lukashenko,' promising to lobby for freeing political prisoners but warning supporters against 'excessive initiative.' Opposition leader calls election ‘a senseless farce’ Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after challenging the president in 2020, told The Associated Press that Sunday's election was 'a senseless farce, a Lukashenko ritual.' Voters should cross off everyone on the ballot, she said, and world leaders shouldn't recognize the result from a country 'where all independent media and opposition parties have been destroyed and prisons are filled by political prisoners.' 'The repressions have become even more brutal as this vote without choice has approached, but Lukashenko acts as though hundreds of thousands of people are still standing outside his palace,' she said. The European Union rejected the election in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened new sanctions. 'Today’s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement. Shortly after voting in Minsk on Sunday, accompanied by his white Pomeranian dog, Lukashenko told journalists that he did not seek recognition or approval from the EU. 'The main thing for me is that Belarusians recognize these elections and that they end peacefully, as they began,' he said. Speaking at an hours-long news conference, Lukashenko said that he didn't rule out running for the top job again in 2030. Media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint against Lukashenko with the International Criminal Court over his crackdown on free speech that saw 397 journalists arrested since 2020. It said that 43 are in prison. Fears of vote-rigging According to the Central Election Commission, there are 6.8 million eligible voters. However, about 500,000 people have left Belarus and aren't able to vote. After polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT), the commission said that turnout stood at a record 85.70%, but a dearth of independent monitoring made that figure near-impossible to verify. At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko's government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship. Polling stations have removed the curtains covering ballot boxes, and voters are forbidden from photographing their ballots — a response to the opposition's call in 2020 for voters to take pictures to make it more difficult for authorities to rig the vote. Police conducted large-scale drills before the election. An Interior Ministry video showed helmeted riot police beating their shields with truncheons as a way to prepare for protest dispersals. Another featured an officer arresting a man posing as a voter, twisting his arm next to a ballot box.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-strongman-wins-a-7th-term-in-an-election-the-opposition-calls-a-farce-/7951359.html	2025-01-26T23:47:44-08:00	
China captures scam center suspect with Thailand's help	BEIJING — Police have detained a man suspected of involvement in the case of a Chinese actor who was duped into travelling to Thailand for a film job and then trafficked to Myanmar, China's Public Security Ministry said. The joint efforts of the ministry's task force and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand, helped by Thai law enforcement, led to the arrest of a 'major criminal suspect' on Saturday, the ministry said in a notice late on Sunday. The ministry added that the suspect was surnamed Yan and returned to China on Saturday, but did not elaborate. Wang Xing, a 22-year-old Chinese actor, traveled to Thailand early this month after receiving an unsolicited offer to join a film that was shooting in Thailand. When Wang got to Bangkok, he was kidnapped, authorities said, and taken to an online scam compound, one of hundreds of thousands of people the United Nations says have been trapped into working for criminal networks running fraudulent telecommunications operations across the region. Wang's case drew national interest after his girlfriend began a social media campaign about his plight, and he was later freed by Thai police who found him in Myanmar. The ministry said the police would step up their efforts to crack down on the scam centers, deepen international law enforcement cooperation, and coordinate with countries involved to detain the criminals and rescue Chinese citizens. The scam compounds that have proliferated in Southeast Asia since the COVID-19 pandemic defraud people across the globe and generate billions of dollars every year for organized crime groups, many of Chinese origin. Last week, officials from China, Myanmar and Thailand reached a consensus on eradicating the centers in Myanmar. China and Thailand also agreed to set up a coordination center in Bangkok to investigate and combat the scam complexes that have mushroomed along Thai borders with Myanmar and Cambodia. The initiative is expected to start operations next month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-captures-scam-center-suspect-with-thailand-s-help/7951349.html	2025-01-26T23:15:09-08:00	
China bans livestock product imports from numerous countries on disease worries	BEIJING — China has prohibited imports of sheep, goat, poultry and even-toed ungulates from African, Asian and European countries due to outbreaks of livestock diseases such as sheep pox, goat pox and foot-and-mouth-disease. The ban, which also includes processed and unprocessed products, comes after the World Health Organization released information of disease outbreaks in various countries, according to a series of announcements by China's General Administration of Customs dated Jan. 21. The ban from the world's largest meat importer affects Ghana, Somalia, Qatar, Congo (DRC), Nigeria, and Tanzania, Egypt, Bulgaria, East Timor and Eritrea. China also said it has stopped imports of sheep, goat and related products from Palestine, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh due to sheep pox and goat pox outbreaks. It also blocked the imports of even-toed ungulates and related products from Germany following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-bans-livestock-product-imports-from-numerous-countries-on-disease-worries/7951334.html	2025-01-26T22:20:27-08:00	
Chiefs, Eagles reach Super Bowl	The Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are set to face off in the National Football League’s Super Bowl, with the Chiefs looking to become the first team to win three consecutive championships and the Eagles trying to avenge their loss from two years ago. The Chiefs reached the Feb. 9 championship game in New Orleans with a 32-29 win on Sunday night over the Buffalo Bills. Kansas City’s star quarterback Patrick Mahomes ran for two touchdowns and threw for another score to reach his fifth Super Bowl in six years. That included the 2023 Super Bowl in which the Chiefs defeated the Eagles 38-35. The Eagles earned their Super Bowl spot with a resounding 55-23 win Sunday over the Washington Commanders. Philadelphia outscored Washington 21-0 in the game’s final quarter to secure the victory. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts ran for three touchdowns and added another through the air, while running back Saquon Barkley added three rushing touchdowns. Oddsmakers made Kansas City the narrow early favorite for the game.

New Zealand loosens visitor visa rules to welcome digital nomads	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand will introduce looser visa rules to allow holiday makers to work remotely while visiting the country, to boost its tourism sector and economy, it said on Monday. Erica Stanford, Immigration Minister said in a statement that the visitor visa would change from Jan. 27 to allow people to work while traveling in the country. 'This is a brand-new market of tourist New Zealand can tap into. We want people to see our country as the ideal place to visit and work while they do it,' she said. She added in a press conference following the announcement that she was unsure how many people would take up the opportunity, but digital nomad visas had been 'extraordinarily popular' overseas and that New Zealand was targeting people who would like the opportunity to work and travel here. 'I expect in their time here that they will spend longer than they normally would, they will spend more because they’re here for longer, and the thing that we’re really hoping, is that they fall in love with the place,' she said. New Zealand’s economy sank into a technical recession in the third quarter of 2024 and the government is looking for ways to boost growth. The tourism sector has not fully bounced back from the closure of borders during the COVID-19 pandemic with international visitors at around 86% of 2019 levels. 'The government's ambition is that new visa rules will put New Zealand boldly on the map as a welcoming haven for the world's talent,' said Nicola Willis, Minister of Economic Growth. 'We hope that in some cases, it will encourage those people and the firms they represent to consider doing more business with New Zealand in the future,' Willis added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-loosens-visitor-visa-rules-to-welcome-digital-nomads/7951306.html	2025-01-26T20:03:51-08:00	
Rwanda-backed rebels in DRC say they have taken control of Goma	GOMA, Democratic Republic of the Congo — Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo's largest city, Goma, early Monday, as the United Nations described a 'mass panic' among its 2 million people and Congo's government said the rebel advance was a 'declaration of war.' The M23 rebels announced the city's capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons expired. In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium. The M23 rebels' offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa's longest wars and further displace civilians. According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation. Late Sunday night, UN peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying that the country is 'in a war situation where the news is changing.' Late Sunday, the U.N.'s special representative for Congo told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that with the airport shut down and roads blocked in the vast region's humanitarian and security hub, 'we are trapped.' Congo late Saturday broke off relations with Rwanda, which has denied backing the M23 despite evidence collected by U.N. experts and others. The surge of violence has killed at least 13 peacekeepers over the past week. And Congolese were again on the run. The M23 has made significant territorial gains along Congo's border with Rwanda in recent weeks, after months of regional attempts to make peace failed. On Sunday night, the rebels called on Congo's army to surrender their arms and present themselves at a local stadium by 3 a.m. or they would take the city. The Uruguayan army, who are in Goma serving with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said in a statement on X late Sunday that some Congolese soldiers have laid down their weapons. 'More than a hundred FARDC soldiers are sheltered in the facilities of the 'Siempre Presente' base awaiting the (Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration) process,' the statement said. In photos shared with the statement, armed men are seen registering with the peacekeepers in a mix of military uniforms and civilian clothing. The U.N. special representative, Bintou Keita, told the Security Council that despite U.N. peacekeepers' support for the Congolese armed forces, M23 and Rwandan forces entered the Munigi neighborhood on Goma's outskirts, 'causing mass panic.' Munigi is 9 kilometers (5 miles) from the city. Keita said M23 fighters were advancing and using residents 'as human shields' as others fled for their lives. 'M23 has declared the airspace over Goma closed,' she added. 'In other words, we are trapped.' She said the U.N. was temporarily relocating nonessential personnel from the city. Congo's foreign minister, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, told the Security Council that Rwanda was committing 'a frontal aggression, a declaration of war which no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.' Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, did not confirm or deny Congo's claims. He blamed Congo's government, saying the crisis could have been been averted if it had 'demonstrated a genuine commitment to peace.' The United States and France called for a ceasefire and appealed to Rwanda to withdraw its support to M23, with acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea warning that the U.S. would 'consider all the tools at its disposal' to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining the armed conflict. In the past 48 hours, two U.N. peacekeepers from South Africa and one from Uruguay were killed and 11 others were injured and hospitalized, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman said ahead of the Security Council meeting. The U.N. chief reiterated his 'strongest condemnation' of the M23 offensive 'with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces,' and called on the rebel group to immediately halt all hostile action and withdraw, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Congo cuts ties with Rwanda Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda's government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate up to 4,000 Rwandan forces are in Congo. Congo's foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling all diplomatic staff from the country 'with immediate effect.' Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told The Associated Press on Sunday that the decision to cut ties was a unilateral move by Congo. 'For us, we took appropriate measures to evacuate our remaining diplomat in Kinshasa, who was under permanent threat by Congolese officials,' Nduhungirehe said. The M23 took Goma once before in 2012, withdrawing after considerable international pressure was put on Rwanda. Civilians flee the rebel advance On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, a few kilometers (miles) from the front line. Scores of children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo for displaced people, near the Rwandan border. 'We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,' said Safi Shangwe, who was heading into the city. Some of the displaced worried they would not be safe in Goma, either. 'I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don't know where to go,' said Adèle Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda. Migration officers at a border crossing east of Goma carefully checked travel documents. 'I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,' Goma resident Muahadi Amani told the AP. U.N. deputy humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya said the situation was rapidly deteriorating. 'If hostilities spill into Goma – a densely populated urban center – the impact on civilians could be devastating,' she said. Congo's army has said it was fending off the M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. peacekeepers and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. In addition to the two South African peacekeepers, seven South African troops with SAMIDIRC have been killed in recent days, South Africa's defense ministry said. Since 2021, Congo's government and allied forces — including the 14,000-strong U.N. mission — have been keeping M23 away from Goma. Goma resident Bahati Jackson's family has been hearing gunfire and remembers fleeing M23's seizure of the city in 2012. But this time, they're staying. 'If we're going to die, it's better to die here,' Jackson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rwanda-backed-rebels-in-drc-say-they-have-taken-control-of-goma/7951304.html	2025-01-26T19:56:49-08:00	
South Korea reports initial findings of Jeju Air crash to ICAO, U.S. and Thailand	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea's authorities investigating last month's Jeju Air plane crash have submitted a preliminary accident report to the U.N. aviation agency and to the authorities of the United States, France and Thailand, an official said on Monday. The investigation into the deadliest air disaster on the country's soil remains ongoing, the report made available on Monday said, focused on the role of 'bird strike' and involving an analysis of the engines and the 'localiser' landing guidance structure. 'These all-out investigation activities aim to determine the accurate cause of the accident,' it said. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.N. agency, requires accident investigators to produce a preliminary report within 30 days of the accident and encourages a final report to be made public within 12 months. The Boeing BA.N 737-800 jet, from Bangkok and scheduled to arrive at Muan International Airport, overshot the runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into the localiser structure, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board on Dec. 29. The localiser aids navigation of an aircraft making an approach to the runway, and the structure built of reinforced concrete and earth at Muan airport supporting the system's antennae was likely a cause of the disaster, experts have said. The report highlighted much of the initial findings by the South Korean investigators that was shared with the families of the victims on Saturday, including the pilots discussing a flock of birds they spotted on its final approach. The exact time of a bird strike reported by the pilots remains unconfirmed, the accident report said, but the aircraft 'made an emergency declaration (Mayday x 3) for a bird strike during a go-around.' 'Both engines were examined, and feathers and bird blood stains were found on each,' it said. 'After the crash into the embankment, fire and a partial explosion occurred. Both engines were buried in the embankment's soil mound, and the fore fuselage scattered up to 30-200 meters from the embankment,' it said. The report does not say what may have led to the two data recorders to stop recording simultaneously just before the pilots declared mayday. The aircraft was at an altitude of 152 meters flying at 298 kmh at the moment the blackboxes stopped recording, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-reports-initial-findings-of-jeju-air-crash-to-icao-u-s-and-thailand/7951299.html	2025-01-26T19:44:21-08:00	
Sweden opens sabotage probe into Baltic undersea cable damage	STOCKHOLM/VILNIUS — An undersea fiber optic cable between Latvia and Sweden was damaged on Sunday, likely as a result of external influence, Latvia said, prompting NATO to deploy patrol ships to the area and triggering a sabotage investigation by Swedish authorities. Sweden's Security Service has seized control of a vessel as part of the probe, the country's prosecution authority said. 'We are now carrying out a number of concrete investigative measures, but I cannot go into what they consist of due to the ongoing preliminary investigation,' senior prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said in a statement. NATO was coordinating military ships and aircraft under its recently deployed mission, dubbed 'Baltic Sentry.' The effort follows a string of incidents in which power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines have been damaged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said her government was coordinating with NATO and other countries in the Baltic Sea region to clarify the circumstances surrounding the latest incident. 'We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant,' Silina told reporters following an extraordinary government meeting. Latvia's navy said earlier on Sunday it had dispatched a patrol boat to inspect a ship and that two other vessels were also subject to investigation. Up to several thousand commercial vessels make their way through the Baltic Sea at any given time, and a number of them passed the broken cable on Sunday, data from the MarineTraffic ship tracking service showed. One such ship, the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Vezhen, escorted to Swedish waters by a Swedish coastguard vessel on Sunday evening, MarineTraffic data showed. It later anchored outside the Swedish naval base in Karlskrona in southern Sweden. It was not immediately clear if the Vezhen, which passed the fiber optic cable at 0045 GMT on Sunday, was subject to investigation. A Swedish coastguard spokesperson declined to comment on the Vezhen or the position of coastguard ships. Bulgarian shipping company Navigation Maritime Bulgare, which listed the Vezhen among its fleet, did not immediately reply to requests for comment outside of office hours. NATO cooperation Swedish navy spokesperson Jimmie Adamsson earlier told Reuters it was too soon to say what caused the damage to the cable or whether it was intentional or a technical fault. 'NATO ships and aircrafts are working together with national resources from the Baltic Sea countries to investigate and, if necessary, take action,' the alliance said in a statement on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country was cooperating closely with NATO and Latvia. NATO said last week it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure and reserved the right to take action against ships suspected of posing a security threat. Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed. Finland's prime minister in a statement said the latest cable damage highlighted the need to increase protection for critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. The cable that broke on Sunday linked the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden's Gotland island and was damaged in Sweden's exclusive economic zone, the Latvian navy said. Communications providers were able to switch to alternative transmission routes, the cable's operator, Latvian State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC), said in a statement, adding it was seeking to contract a vessel to begin repairs. 'The exact nature of the damage can only be determined once cable repair work begins,' LVRTC said. A spokesperson for the operator said the cable was laid at depths of more than 50 meters (164 feet). Unlike seabed gas pipelines and power cables, which can take many months to repair after damage, fiber optic cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea have generally been restored within weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-opens-sabotage-probe-into-baltic-undersea-cable-damage/7951298.html	2025-01-26T19:42:06-08:00	
Russia says its troops have captured a strategic town in eastern Ukraine	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia on Sunday claimed its troops had captured a strategically important town in eastern Ukraine as part of a grinding campaign to weaken Kyiv's grip on the country's industrial heartland, while uncertainty over the continued flow of U.S. funding has reportedly halted the work of some Ukrainian NGOs, including those helping war veterans. Russia's Defense Ministry announced the fall of Velyka Novosilka, which had around 5,000 residents before the war, following a monthslong battle. Its statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine claimed its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain areas. But if confirmed, it would make Velyka Novosilka the first significant town to capitulate in 2025 under Moscow's onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region against Ukraine's weary and short-handed army. The war is set to reach its three-year milestone in February. Ukrainian forces withdrew from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said in a statement on its official Telegram channel Sunday. The brigade is active in that patch of the frontline. Analysts have long predicted that it's only a matter of time until Russian forces capture the settlement, which lies only 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. The brigade said though they have approximate parity with Russian forces in terms of artillery and drones, the Russians have a huge advantage in manpower. 'Our units, using the weather conditions, skillfully withdrew from areas where there was a threat of encirclement. This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues . All actions are aimed at minimizing our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy,' the statement said. The brigade said the withdrawal will make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle. 'The enemy (…) will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones,' the statement said. Russia captured the Donetsk cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year after long and grueling battles. Those cities were largely leveled by Russian artillery, glide bombs and drones before they fell. Russian forces have also been trying for months to capture the key Donetsk strongholds of Pokrovsk and Chasiv Yar. Elsewhere, Ukrainian NGOs catering to the needs of war veterans and their families have claimed a suspension of U.S. funding is forcing them to halt their work, days after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later claimed that military aid to Ukraine would continue, but did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Kyiv relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs. According to news reports, Ukrainian NGOs receiving funding from Washington this weekend began receiving 'stop work' orders, requiring them to pause all projects and related travel. Veteran Hub, an NGO that provides legal and psychological support to war veterans and their families, was forced to halt operations of two of its three largest service units as a result, the organization said in its official Facebook page. It said the suspension has led it to ask for public donations for the first time. 'Since 2018, we have refrained from public fundraising because we believe that donations are primarily needed for the military. Today, we are forced to publicly ask for support for the first time,' the organization said. With the Trump administration questioning the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks. For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine's defenses in the eastern Donetsk region. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-its-troops-have-captured-a-strategic-town-in-eastern-ukraine/7951296.html	2025-01-26T19:36:03-08:00	
Percival Everett's 'James' awarded Carnegie Medal for fiction	NEW YORK — For author Percival Everett, libraries have long been a source of knowledge and discovery and pleasure, even of the forbidden kind. 'I remember making friends at age 13 with the librarian at the University of South Carolina, and she used to let me go through the stacks when I wasn't supposed to,' Everett, who spent part of his childhood in Columbia, said during a telephone interview Sunday. 'One of the wonderful things about libraries is that when you're looking for one book, it's surrounded by other books that may not be connected to it. That's what you get (online) with links, but (in libraries) no one's decided what the links are.' Everett's latest honor comes from the country's public libraries. On Sunday, the American Library Association announced that Everett's 'James' was this year's winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, which includes a $5,000 cash award. Kevin Fedarko's 'A Walk in the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand Canyon' was chosen for nonfiction. Everett's acclaimed reworking of Mark Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' from the perspective of Jim, Huck Finn's enslaved companion, has already received the National Book Award and the Kirkus Prize and is a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award. 'James' has even topped The New York Times fiction hardcover list, a rare feat in recent years for a literary work that wasn't a major book club pick or movie tie-in. 'Percival Everett has written a modern masterpiece, a beautiful and important work that offers a fresh perspective from the eyes of a classic character,' Allison Escoto, chair of the award's selection committee, said in a statement. 'Kevin Fedarko's unforgettable journey through the otherworldly depths of the Grand Canyon shows us the triumphs and pitfalls of exploration and illuminates the many vital lessons we can all learn from our precious natural world.' Fedarko is a former Time magazine correspondent whose work also has appeared in The New York Times and Esquire. A Pittsburgh native fascinated by distant places, Fedarko has a long history with libraries — Carnegie libraries. He remembers visiting two while growing up, notably one in the suburb of Oakmont near the hairdressing salon his parents ran. He would read biographies of historical figures from George Washington to Daniel Boone, and otherwise think of libraries as 'important threads running through his life,' windows to a 'wider world.' Now a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fedarko says that he relied in part on the library at the nearby Northern Arizona University campus for both 'A Walk in the Park' and its predecessor, also about the Grand Canyon, 'The Emerald Mile.' 'The library has an important and unique collection about the Grand Canyon, and it's the backbone of the kind of history that helps form the framework of both books,' he says. 'Neither of them could have been done without the library.' Previous winners of the medals, established in 2012 with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, includes Donna Tartt's 'The Goldfinch,' Colson Whitehead's 'The Underground Railroad' and Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'The Bully Pulpit.' This year's finalists besides 'James' in the fiction category were Jiaming Tang's 'Cinema Love' and Kavin Akbar's 'Martyr!' Adam Higginbotham's 'Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space' and Emily Nussbaum's 'Cue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV' were the nonfiction runners-up. All three fiction nominees were published by Penguin Random House and all three nonfiction finalists by Simon & Schuster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/percival-everett-s-james-awarded-carnegie-medal-for-fiction/7951293.html	2025-01-26T19:13:55-08:00	
Sierra Leone investigating reports Dutch drug kingpin took refuge in country	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Sierra Leone's information ministry said Sunday it was investigating media reports that European cocaine kingpin Jos Leijdekkers is in the country and benefiting from high-level protection there. Two sources told Reuters on Friday that Leijdekkers, who was sentenced last June in absentia to 24 years in prison by a Dutch court for smuggling more than 7 tons of cocaine, had been in Sierra Leone since at least early 2023. A spokesperson for the Dutch prosecutors' office said in response to questions from Reuters about Leijdekkers' whereabouts that he has been living in Sierra Leone for at least six months. Leijdekkers is on Europol's list of most wanted fugitives. In a statement, the Sierra Leonean ministry said the country's police were ready to collaborate with the Dutch government, Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies about the case. The statement said the country's president 'attended numerous family events during the festive season' and 'has no knowledge about the identity and the issues detailed in the reports about the individual in question.' Reuters was not able to reach Leijdekkers. Videos and photos verified by Reuters of a church Mass in Sierra Leone on Jan. 1, 2025, show Leijdekkers, 33, sitting two rows behind Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio. In the images, Leijdekkers was sitting next to a woman who three sources said was Bio's daughter Agnes and who they said was married to Leijdekkers. Reuters could not confirm the relationship. Bio's daughter and the Dutch lawyer who last represented Leijdekkers in the Netherlands did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Three sources told Reuters Leijdekkers was benefiting from high-level protection in Sierra Leone, which international law enforcement officials say is a transshipment point for large volumes of Latin American cocaine headed to Europe. The Sierra Leonean information ministry said the government had not received any formal communication on Leijdekkers from any state or institution, and was resolute in ensuring the country would not become a haven for any organized crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sierra-leone-investigating-reports-dutch-drug-kingpin-took-refuge-in-country/7951251.html	2025-01-26T17:30:32-08:00	
Canadian ex-soldier detained by Afghan Taliban freed	Doha, Qatar — A Canadian ex-soldier detained by the Taliban government in Afghanistan was freed Sunday after over two months of imprisonment in a deal brokered by Qatar, a source with knowledge of the release told AFP. David Lavery was detained by Taliban authorities in Kabul in November 2024 and had made headlines three years earlier helping in the evacuation of Afghans during the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces from the country. 'Lavery has been released from Afghanistan and is now in Doha, Qatar,' the source said on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, adding his freedom 'was secured following a request from the Canadian government to Qatar.' 'Qatari mediators coordinated with senior Canadian officials and utilized their contacts in Afghanistan to dispatch a medical team to Kabul to assess Lavery's condition and provide care, while also facilitating contact between Lavery and his family,' the source said. 'Following a breakthrough in the talks, Mr. Lavery (is) in Doha now united with his family. He underwent a medical assessment upon his arrival,' the source added. In 2021, Lavery helped an estimated 100 Afghans flee Kabul during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces. He spent decades in the Canadian military and is said to have been a key member of its elite Joint Task Force 2 special operations unit. More recently, Lavery has reportedly operated a private security firm in Kabul. The former soldier's release follows the liberation last week by the Taliban government of two U.S. citizens from prison in return for an Afghan fighter held in the United States, in another deal brokered by Qatar. Ryan Corbett, who had been detained in 2022, and William McKenty were released in exchange for Khan Mohammed, who was convicted of narco-terrorism by a U.S. court. The Afghan foreign ministry said Mohammed was 'an Afghan fighter' who had been 'imprisoned in America.' Two other U.S. citizens are believed to remain in detention in Afghanistan, former airline mechanic George Glezmann and naturalized American Mahmood Habibi. Gas-rich Qatar hosted Taliban representatives during years of peace talks with the United States leading up to the 2021 withdrawal and in recent years has hosted rounds of Afghan dialogue which the Taliban authorities joined in June 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadian-ex-soldier-detained-by-afghan-taliban-freed/7951254.html	2025-01-26T17:00:18-08:00	
Italy resumes migrant transfers to processing centers in Albania	Rome — Italy said Sunday it was transferring 49 migrants picked up in the Mediterranean to new processing centers in Albania, in the third such attempt facing hurdles by courts. The navy vessel Cassiopea with the migrants on board was expected to reach the Albanian port of Shengjin on Tuesday morning, port officials said. The Interior Ministry said Sunday that 53 other migrants 'spontaneously presented their passports' after they were told that it would avoid their transfer to Albania. Where the nationality is confirmed, processing generally takes less time as people who are determined by Italy to be ineligible to apply for asylum in the European Union are repatriated via a fast-track procedure. Italian judges refused to validate the detention of the first two small groups in the Albanian centers, built under a contentious agreement between Rome and Tirana. Their cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice, which had earlier established that asylum applicants could not undergo a fast-track procedure that could lead to repatriation if their country of provenance was not deemed completely safe. The European court hearing on the case is scheduled for Feb. 25. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government had vowed to reactivate the two centers in Albania that have remained dormant following the Italian courts’ decisions. The premier’s position was partially backed by a ruling in late December by Italy’s highest court, which said Italian judges could not substitute for government policy in deciding which countries are safe for repatriation of migrants whose asylum requests are rejected. The decision does allow lower courts to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis, short of setting overall policy. Italy has earmarked $675 million (650 million euros) to run the centers over five years. They opened in October ready to accept up to 3,000 male migrants a month picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. Meloni has repeatedly stressed that plans to process migrants outside EU borders in Albania had received strong backing from other European leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-resumes-migrant-transfers-to-processing-centers-in-albania/7951226.html	2025-01-26T16:00:22-08:00	
Germany holds commemoration for 2 people killed in knife attack	Berlin — Government officials and residents attended a solemn Mass Sunday to honor a child and a man killed in a knife attack in Germany, an assault that amplified the debate about migration ahead of the Feb. 23 general election. The ecumenical religious service at the Catholic Basilica of St. Peter and Alexander in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was briefly suspended for the tolling of the city’s bells at the exact time that the attack took place Wednesday, 11:45 a.m. Bavaria Governor Markus Soder, Aschaffenburg Mayor Jurgen Herzing and Muslim imam Zischan Mehmood addressed the congregation that included rescuers, to express grief and disbelief at the loss of lives. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser was also present. 'Compassion, solidarity and cohesion are more important than ever, because there are many dividers and agitators around us,' Mehmood told the people gathered in and outside the church. 'We must never allow grief and pain to tear us apart.' Soder said the attack was a 'senseless, brutal and disturbing crime.' 'Good and evil are not a question of origin, nationality, ethnicity or faith,' Soder said, and stressed that the killings should not lead to divisions because 'incitement is the wrong answer.' Before attending the service, Faeser and Soder laid wreaths at the site of the attack. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election as migration policy is among the top campaign issues. A 2-year-old boy of Moroccan origin, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who apparently intervened to protect the children in a city park. The arrested suspect is a 28-year-old former asylum-seeker from Afghanistan who had been told to leave Germany. Officials said he had received psychiatric treatment and there was no immediate indication that he was motivated by extremism. He is being held in a psychiatric hospital, according to the German news agency, dpa. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were also wounded in the attack and hospitalized but there was no danger to their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-holds-commemoration-for-2-people-killed-in-knife-attack/7950989.html	2025-01-26T15:25:10-08:00	
Lebanon, Gaza ceasefires with Israel teeter on shaky ground	Israeli ceasefires with Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza appeared to be on fragile ground Sunday as Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians in both regions, killing at least 23 people and injuring dozens. In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said at least 22 were killed and 124 others injured as Israel confirmed it would not meet the 60-day deadline to withdraw its troops as part of the ceasefire it reached with Hezbollah in November. On Sunday, the White House released a statement that the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, would continue to be in effect until February 18. 'The Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after Oct. 7, 2023,' the statement said. Israel blamed the militants and the Lebanese army for failing to meet their own commitments under the truce. The Israeli military said that it fired 'warning shots' toward 'suspects' and that it had detained an unspecified number of people. Under terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat to the north away from the Israeli border and Israel was to pull out of Lebanon. In a statement, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned that it was 'imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.' It urged the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese people to adhere to the directives of the Lebanese military. 'Further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation,' the statement said. In Gaza, the long-awaited return of Palestinians from the central and southern regions of the territory to the northern sector was delayed in a dispute over the release of a female hostage held by Hamas. Israel said it would not retreat from the heavily fortified Netzarim Corridor, which divides the enclave, until another female hostage, Arbel Yehoud, an Israeli civilian, is freed. She was supposed to have been released Saturday. Israeli forces fired at Palestinians along a coastal road near the checkpoint, killing at least one person and injuring 18 others, according to a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza. The Israeli military said in a statement that it 'identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat.' The violence exhibited the tenuous nature of the two ceasefires, both of which were brokered in part by the United States in contentious negotiations during the final months of the administration of President Joe Biden. Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, participated in the talks to reach the Gaza ceasefire. Trump on Saturday called on Egypt and Jordan to take in more Palestinians from Gaza to 'clean out' the enclave after much of it has been leveled by 15 months of Israeli-Hamas fighting. The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 47,000 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials, although the Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 100 hostages, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during a six-week truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Seven Israeli hostages and nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners have been freed thus far.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-gaza-ceasefires-with-israel-teeter-on-shaky-ground/7950986.html	2025-01-26T15:07:18-08:00

UN chief calls for Rwandan forces to leave DR Congo	United Nations, United States — U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called Sunday on Rwandan forces to withdraw from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and halt support for fighters advancing on the key Congolese city of Goma. M23 fighters backed by several thousand Rwandan troops have been quickly advancing toward the city, which lies along DRC's eastern border and is home to more than a million people. Several foreign peacekeepers have been killed in the mounting violence around Goma. 'The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by the escalating violence' and 'calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease support to the M23 and withdraw from DRC territory,' said a statement from his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. Guterres had previously referred to a U.N. experts' report citing Kigali's backing of the M23 but had not explicitly called on Rwanda to withdraw from DRC territory. In his statement Sunday, made after three U.N. peacekeepers in eastern DRC had been killed within 48 hours, Guterres emphasized that 'attacks against United Nations personnel may constitute a war crime.' The U.N. in the meantime has begun to evacuate 'non-essential' staff from the major city of Goma in eastern DRC, a United Nations source told AFP. During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council session Sunday, permanent member states France, Britain and the United States called on Rwanda to pull its forces back. But others, including China and the African nations holding rotating council seats, did not specifically name Kigali. The Security Council as a whole has yet to accuse Rwanda of taking part directly in the conflict, simply underlining the importance of the DRC's territorial integrity. But the French ambassador to the U.N., Nicolas de Riviere, indicated Sunday he was working on a Security Council statement that would 'call a cat a cat,' a phrase essentially meaning to state directly what something is without sugarcoating it. He urged the Council to condemn what he said was a grave threat to regional peace and security. Congolese foreign minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner went further, urging the Council to impose sweeping economic and political sanctions on Kigali. She accused Rwanda of having sent new troops into eastern DRC on Sunday, actions which she said amounted to a 'declaration of war.' But Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, rejected the accusations, accusing Kinshasa of being responsible for the deteriorating situation and failing to make a 'genuine commitment to peace.' He suggested that the U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC had joined a 'coalition' seeking regime change in Rwanda. The fighting in the region has forced some 230,000 to flee their homes. Eastern DRC has vast mining resources and is a complex landscape of rival armed militias which has seen violence ebb and flow since the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-calls-for-rwandan-forces-to-leave-dr-congo/7950969.html	2025-01-26T14:01:15-08:00	
Islamist militants kill at least 20 Nigerian troops, security sources say	MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — Suspected Islamist fighters killed at least 20 Nigerian soldiers, including a commanding officer, after attacking an army base in a remote town in northeastern Borno state, security sources and residents said Sunday. Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have mainly operated in Borno, targeting security forces and civilians, in the process killing and displacing tens of thousands of people. The latest assault happened Friday, when ISWAP members arrived on gun trucks and attacked the army's 149 Battalion in Malam-Fatori town, gateway to the border with Niger, two soldiers and residents said. One of the soldiers who survived the attack told Reuters by phone that troops were taken by surprise as the militants 'rained bullets everywhere.' 'We tried so much to repel the attacks and after more than three hours of gun duel, they overpowered us, killing our commanding officer, a lieutenant colonel,' the soldier said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. He said 20 soldiers died while several were injured. A Nigerian army spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Residents who left the town said some of the militants were seen in Malam-Fatori as late as Saturday night. Malakaka Bukar, a member of the local militia recruited to help the army, said the militants also burned buildings, forcing some residents to flee the town. 'They preached to some of the residents,' said Bukar. Although weakened by military assaults and internal fighting over the years, Boko Haram and ISWAP have stepped up attacks in Borno since the turn of the year, killing dozens of farmers and fishermen in series of raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamist-militants-kill-at-least-20-nigerian-troops-security-sources-say/7950960.html	2025-01-26T13:48:19-08:00	
Kenyan tech firm turns plastic waste into 3D images; boosts learning, cuts emissions	Plastic waste accounts for 10 to 12 percent of all solid waste in Kenya, according to the United Nations Environmental Program.

Trump orders tariffs, visa restrictions on Colombia over rejection of deportation flights	Bogota, Colombia — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was ordering tariffs, visa restrictions and other retaliatory measures to be taken against Colombia after its government rejected two flights carrying migrants. Trump said the measures were necessary, because the decision of Colombian President Gustavo Petro 'jeopardized' national security in the United States. 'These measures are just the beginning,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.' Earlier Sunday, Petro said that his government won't accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with 'dignity.' Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. 'A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,' Petro said. 'That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants.' Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the United States from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. Last year, Colombia and other countries began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama. The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia. Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, added that his country would receive Colombians in 'civilian airplanes' and 'without treatment like criminals.' As part of a flurry of actions to make good on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations. Two Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people. In announcing what he called 'urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,' Trump explained that he ordered '25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States,' which would be raised to 50% in one week. He said he also ordered 'A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations' on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters. 'All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,' Trump wrote will be subject to 'Visa Sanctions.' He didn't say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions. Trump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-tariffs-visa-restrictions-on-colombia-over-rejection-of-deportation-flights/7950941.html	2025-01-26T13:01:22-08:00

India celebrates Republic Day with Indonesian president observing	New Delhi — India celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday with a colorful parade displaying its military might and cultural diversity on a boulevard in the heart of country’s capital. Indonesian president was the guest of honor. Tens of thousands of people lined the road on a cold Sunday morning to watch the long parade to mark the anniversary of the official adoption of India’s Constitution on Jan. 26, 1950, nearly three years after independence from British colonial rule. Soldiers from India’s military and paramilitary, along with their bands, marched as the country’s leaders and other guests watched. Various floats displayed India’s cultural diversity with one showcasing the Maha Kumbh festival, the ongoing massive Hindu festival touted as the world’s largest religious gathering. The parade took place on Rajpath Avenue, built by India’s former British rulers and lined by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees. The avenue was redeveloped as part of the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Indian independence and renamed Kartavayapath, or the Boulevard of Duty, in 2022. Visiting Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto attended the event as the chief guest and was flanked by India’s president and prime minister. A 342-member band and marching contingent from the Indonesian National Armed Forces joined the parade, the first time the ASEAN country's troops have joined any foreign parade. India traditionally invites foreign leaders to witness the spectacle. French President Emmanuel Macron was the guest of honor last year and former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015. Ten Southeast Asian leaders watched the parade in 2018. Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president and the leader of the country’s independence struggle, was the chief guest at India’s first Republic Day celebration in 1950. Thousands of men and women in colorful costumes played marches, performed traditional dances and pulled motorbike stunts during the 90-minute parade. It also showcased India’s domestically built defense equipment and military systems, including tanks, infantry combat vehicles, radar systems and missile systems. Some 5,000 artists, carrying traditional props like spears, swords and drums, performed over 40 dance forms from different parts of India in a cultural performance that lasted about 10 minutes. The parade ended with a fly-past by air force fighters, including Rafale jets, transport planes and helicopters. The parade was broadcast live by television networks. Republic Day parades also took place in state capitals and other cities across India amid massive security arrangements. In Srinagar, the main city of disputed Kashmir, armed police and soldiers patrolled as regional officials celebrated Republic Day. Hundreds of people braved winter chills to witness the parade amid additional security, with police and soldiers checking vehicles and frisking pedestrians. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-celebrates-republic-day-with-indonesian-president-observing/7950904.html	2025-01-26T11:36:18-08:00	
Mel Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’ expands	New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s 'Flight Risk' managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a 'C' CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a 'special ambassador' to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar 'bump' that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted 'The Brutalist,' which is running with an intermission, as 'un-distributable,' Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release. In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for 'The Brutalist.' The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’ 'Nickel Boys.' Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s 'Presence,' a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. 'One of Them Days,' the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but 'One of Them Days' has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Flight Risk,' $12 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $8.7 million. 3. 'One of Them Days,' $8 million. 4. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $5.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $4.3 million. 6. 'Presence,' $3.4 million. 7. 'Wolf Man,' $3.4 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $3.1 million. 9. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $3 million. 10. 'The Brutalist,' $2.9 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mel-gibson-s-flight-risk-is-no-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands-/7950872.html	2025-01-26T10:54:08-08:00	
With Trump in power, US quickly deporting undocumented migrants	U.S. authorities are now arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States. 'We’re going to enforce immigration laws,' Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House. 'It’s going very well. We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out,' Trump told reporters Friday during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene. Without evidence, he said, 'These are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you’ve seen. We’re taking them out first.' The White House released photos of shackled migrants boarding a C-17 military transport aircraft for flights out of the United States. Trump’s 'border czar,' Tom Homan, told ABC’s 'This Week' show Sunday, 'There will be more arrests nationwide.' Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, 'You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.' He said the U.S. is deporting 'as many as we can' arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials. 'We’re in the beginning stages,' Homan said. 'It’s not OK to violate the laws of this country,' Homan said. He urged undocumented migrants, even those who have not been ordered out of the U.S., to return to their home countries voluntarily. About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport. 'We’re going to do what we can with the money we have,' Homan said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort. 'We haven't given the Trump team the resources,' Graham said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. He said Homan 'needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.' 'So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,' Graham declared. The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-trump-in-power-us-quickly-deporting-undocumented-migrants-/7950864.html	2025-01-26T10:34:50-08:00	
Iran's foreign minister meets Taliban in 1st visit to Kabul in 8 years	Top Taliban officials met Iran’s foreign minister Sunday to discuss tensions along their shared border, the treatment of Afghan refugees in Iran and water rights. It was the first visit by an Iranian foreign minister to the Afghan capital since 2017. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was committed to the return of some 3.5 million Afghan refugees and had no intention of interfering in its neighbor’s domestic politics, according to a statement from the Afghan government’s deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat. He also called for the full implementation of the Helmand River water treaty, which envisions shared water resources, the statement said. Acting Prime Minister Hassan Akhund asked Iran to treat Afghan refugees with respect and said it was not feasible to manage a large-scale repatriation within a short period. He also said incidents such as the execution of Afghans in Iran provoked public sentiment. Araghchi also met Afghanistan's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and Defense Minister Mohammad Yaqoob. Earlier Sunday, Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted Araghchi as saying he hoped for more economic ties and improved relations with Afghanistan, citing some 'ups and downs.' Iran doesn’t formally recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which seized power in 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country following two decades of war. But Tehran maintains political and economic ties with Kabul and has allowed the Taliban to manage Afghanistan’s Embassy in Iran's capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-meets-taliban-in-1st-visit-to-kabul-in-8-years-/7950827.html	2025-01-26T09:47:03-08:00	
As Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in store	Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump's priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement — something done rarely. Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including developing the Pentagon's massive budget, decisions about aid to Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday, Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has made that shift impossible to execute. Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains 'the strongest and most lethal force in the world.' He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an official photo saying Hegseth was 'ready to get to work on behalf of America’s warriors.' Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders, including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as 'drinking from a firehose' as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat zones. Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military. Many expect they will surface in the coming days. Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right away: Border deployments In trying to meet Trump's demand of securing the border, Hegseth will face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house, feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure none of this affects other national security requirements. One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to avoid. Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an executive order directing that his defense and homeland security secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during emergencies. During previous deployments, troops have been used for transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and conduct the law enforcement duties. Transgender troops In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in office. The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such in military paperwork. The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to track. The budget and Ukraine Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850 billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal — something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively about cutting waste. So Hegseth's imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how that's being done. Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine. The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what he will do on Ukraine aid. Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks Hegseth will take over the Pentagon's push to implement Trump's executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers fret over whether they will be fired for being 'woke,' as Hegseth has pledged to do. During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies 'divide' troops and do not prioritize 'meritocracy.' Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as other federal agencies have. But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example, temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came back online. Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from lawmakers. He most recently told senators that he's not aware that Trump wants to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs. Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards. Reproductive care After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care — including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due to medical privacy laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-hegseth-takes-charge-at-pentagon-here-are-what-changes-could-be-in-store/7950776.html	2025-01-26T08:06:33-08:00	
Thousands in Ireland still without power as officials say Storm Eowyn cleanup will take time	London — Ireland called in help from England and France on Sunday as repair crews worked to restore power to hundreds of thousands of people after the most disruptive storm for years. More than 1 million people in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland were left without electricity after Storm Eowyn roared through on Friday. In Ireland, which suffered the heaviest damage, the wind snapped telephone poles, ripped apart a Dublin ice rink and even toppled a giant wind turbine. A wind gust of 183 kph was recorded on the west coast, breaking a record set in 1945. The state electricity company, ESB Networks, said that more than 300,000 properties in Ireland still had no power on Sunday, down from 768,000 on Friday. The Irish military was also helping out, but the company said that it could be two more weeks before electricity is restored to everyone. Irish Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary said authorities were 'throwing everything at it.' 'We’re bringing additional people from England today and we’re looking for people from France, additional technicians,' he told broadcaster RTE. 'What we’re focused on is getting our infrastructure back up, getting our power back up, getting our water and connectivity back up as soon as is possible.' Another 75,000 people were still without power on Sunday in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and neighbors the Republic of Ireland. At least two people died during the storm. Kacper Dudek, 20, was killed when a tree fell on his car in County Donegal in northwest Ireland, local police said. Police in Scotland said that a 19-year-old man, who hasn't been named, died in a hospital on Saturday after a tree fell on his car in the southwestern town of Mauchline on Friday. More rainy and windy weather battered Britain and Ireland on Sunday, with a gust of 132 kph recorded at Predannack in southwest England.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-ireland-still-without-power-as-officials-say-storm-%c3%a9owyn-cleanup-will-take-time-/7950764.html	2025-01-26T07:58:19-08:00	
Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev for 2nd Australian Open title	MELBOURNE, Australia — There's all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominant Jannik Sinner was while outplaying and frustrating Alexander Zverev during the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutive Australian Open championship. The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach. Well, here's is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner. 'I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,' Zverev said. 'At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.' High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June and is not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal — also in straight sets. 'It's amazing,' Sinner said, 'to achieve these things.' The 'things' include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later. Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his. 'This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,' he said. 'I had more pressure.' Probably true, but it's hard to tell. Go to the start of 2024 and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches. 'There's always something that can get better,' said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. 'He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.' The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems, is the doping case in which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April. 'I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,' Sinner said Sunday. 'I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.' While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals, Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year's French Open. Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all. 'I’ll keep doing everything I can,' Zverev said, 'to lift one of those trophies.' Just before Zverev began speaking into a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends who accused him of physical abuse. During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived. A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic — who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev. This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes. 'The facts speak for themselves,' Zverev said. 'He’s in a different universe right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jannik-sinner-beats-alexander-zverev-for-2nd-australian-open-title/7950756.html	2025-01-26T07:49:44-08:00	
Pope Francis warns of 'scourge of antisemitism' ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned of the 'scourge of antisemitism' in his Angelus prayer on Sunday, the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, noting it marks 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. 'The horror of the extermination of millions of Jewish people and others of different faiths during those years must never be forgotten or denied,' Francis said, citing the example of Hungarian-born poet Edith Bruck, who lives in Rome. He noted that many Christians were also killed in Nazi concentration camps, 'among whom there were numerous martyrs.' 'I renew my appeal for everyone to work together to eradicate the scourge of antisemitism, along with every form of discrimination and religious persecution,' Francis said. 'Together, let us build a more fraternal, just world, educating young people to have hearts open to all, in the spirit of fraternity, forgiveness, and peace,' he added. The pontiff also launched an appeal for an end to the civil war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, saying it is causing 'the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world, with dramatic consequences even in South Sudan.' The pope also expressed concern for the situation in Colombia’s Catatumbo region, where many civilians have been killed by clashes between armed groups, which have forced over 30,000 people to leave their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-warns-of-scourge-of-antisemitism-ahead-of-holocaust-remembrance-day-/7950693.html	2025-01-26T06:16:32-08:00	
Congo severs ties with Rwanda as rebels close in on Goma, displacing thousands	GOMA, DRC — Congo severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda as fighting between Rwanda-backed rebels and government forces raged around the key eastern city of Goma, leaving at least 13 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers dead and displacing thousands of civilians. The M23 rebel group has made significant territorial gains along the border with Rwanda in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, the provincial capital of around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda's government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. The Congolese foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling out all diplomatic staff from the country 'with immediate effect.' Rwanda did not comment immediately. The U.N. Security Council moved up an emergency meeting on the escalating violence in eastern Congo to Sunday. Congo requested the meeting, which had originally been scheduled for Monday. On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, just a few kilometers from the front line, while scores of displaced children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo, right near the Rwandan border, and headed south to Goma. 'We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,' said Safi Shangwe, who was heading to Goma. 'We are tired and we are afraid, our children are at risk of starving,' she added. Some of the displaced worried they will not be safe in Goma either. 'We are going to Goma, but I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don't know where to go,' said Adèle Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda through the border crossings east of Goma on Sunday while migration officers carefully checked travel documents. 'I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,' Muahadi Amani, a resident of Goma, told The Associated Press. Earlier in the week, the rebels seized Sake, 27 kilometers from Goma, as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Congo's army said Saturday it fended off an M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. troops and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. Two South African peacekeepers were killed Friday, while a Uruguayan soldier was killed Saturday, a U.N. official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter publicly. Additionally, three Malawian peacekeepers were killed in eastern Congo, the United Nations in Malawi said Saturday. Seven South African soldiers from the SAMIDRC were also killed during clashes with M23 over the last two days, South Africa's Defense Department said. Since 2021, Congo's government and allied forces, including SAMIDRC and U.N. troops, have been keeping M23 away from Goma. The U.N peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-severs-ties-with-rwanda-as-rebels-close-in-on-goma-displacing-thousands-/7950644.html	2025-01-26T04:45:16-08:00	
South Korean president indicted as 'ringleader of an insurrection'	Seoul — South Korean prosecutors indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol Sunday for being the 'ringleader of an insurrection' after his abortive declaration of martial law, ordering the suspended leader to remain in detention. Yoon plunged the country into political chaos with his December 3 bid to suspend civilian rule, a move which lasted just six hours before lawmakers defied armed soldiers in parliament to vote it down. He was impeached soon after, and earlier this month became the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. That came after a weekslong holdout at his residence, where his elite personal security detail resisted attempts to detain him. In a statement, prosecutors said they had 'indicted Yoon Suk Yeol with detention today on charges of being the ringleader of an insurrection.' He has been held at the Seoul Detention Center since his arrest, and the formal indictment with detention means he will now be kept behind bars until his trial, which must happen within six months. The indictment was widely expected after a court twice rejected requests by prosecutors to extend his arrest warrant while their investigation proceeded. 'After a comprehensive review of evidence obtained during investigations [prosecutors] concluded that it was only appropriate to indict the defendant,' they said in a statement. The need to keep Yoon behind bars was justified by a 'continued risk of evidence destruction,' they said. The specific charge — being the ringleader of an insurrection — is not covered by presidential immunity, they added. 'Process of accountability' The opposition hailed the indictment. 'We need to hold not only those who schemed to carry out an illegal insurrection, but also those who instigated it by spreading misinformation,' said lawmaker Han Min-soo. Without providing evidence, Yoon and his legal team have pointed to purported election fraud and legislative gridlock at the opposition-controlled parliament as justification for his declaration of martial law. Yoon has vowed to 'fight to the end', earning the support of supporters who have adopted the 'stop the steal' rhetoric associated with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'This indictment will provide a sense of relief, reaffirming that the constitutional order is functioning as it should,' said Bae Kang-hoon, co-founder of political think tank Valid. Yoon also faces a series of Constitutional Court hearings, to decide whether to uphold his impeachment and strip him formally of the presidency. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and an election will be called within 60 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-indicted-as-ringleader-of-an-insurrection-/7950623.html	2025-01-26T03:26:48-08:00	
3 killed in Lebanon amid protests as Israeli forces remain	MAYS AL-JABAL, LEBANON — At least three people were killed and more than 40 others injured in southern Lebanon Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on protesters who had breached roadblocks the Israeli army set up a day before, Lebanon's health ministry reported. Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages in the border area to protest Israel's failure to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, said in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that 'Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.' He urged them to 'exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said in a statement that Sunday's bloodshed 'is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.' Lebanon's Health Ministry said in a statement that one protester was killed and 10 others injured in the border village of Houla. Another protester was killed in the village of Aitaroun and 11 injured. A third protester was killed in the village of Blida and one person injured. The health ministry also reported injuries in the areas of Mays al-Jabal, Markaba, Bani Hayyan, Odaisseh, Rab Thalatin and Kfar Kila. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the protests. The Israeli army's Arabic language spokesperson called Sunday morning in a post on X for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. An AP team was stranded overnight at a base of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. 'These are our houses,' said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. 'However much they destroy, we will rebuild.' Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. 'I don't know how much we're going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,' he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced, out of over 1 million displaced during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-lebanon-amid-protests-as-israeli-forces-remain/7950610.html	2025-01-26T02:36:54-08:00	
Facebook scammers use fake VOA article to push Russian cryptocurrency scheme	When American conservative commentator Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian IT entrepreneur Pavel Durov in April, he had an additional unexpected audience: scammers. After the video was published, a phony Russian-language transcript of the interview tried to attract 'investors' to a cryptocurrency scheme that promised monthly earnings of $13,000. That scheme came to VOA’s attention because its creators used a copy of a VOA Russian article page in their attempts to defraud internet users. It is one of many examples of legitimate media outlets being exploited for fraudulent purposes. These schemes buy advertising using Facebook accounts — often hacked without the user’s knowledge — spanning countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Afghanistan. The strategy and rhetoric follow a pattern, according to Jordan Liles, at American fact-checking site Snopes.com. 'There are so many scams online that pose as legitimate publishers,' he told VOA. 'Name any publisher – they’ve probably been used in scams to try to fool people who don’t look at their web address bar.' There is no indication that Durov or Carlson is involved in the scheme. VOA reached out to them for comment but received no response. In a statement, Facebook parent company Meta told VOA it takes scams seriously. 'Fraud is a problem that’s always persisted with new technology,' the company wrote. 'But that’s exactly why Meta always has — and always will — take a hard line against scams, fraud and abuse in all of its forms to help keep it off of our platforms.' Scammers have previously posed as Voice of America, using deepfakes in two separate cases that targeted VOA Russian journalists. Those cases relied on artificial intelligence. In contrast, the Durov scam takes a distinctly low-tech approach: It uses a Q&A-style text transcript in Russian that falsely claims to be a 'continuation' of Carlson’s interview. The founder of Russian social media site VKontakte and messenger app Telegram, Durov is a well-known tech entrepreneur. That makes him harder to impersonate. According to an April 2024 report by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, while deepfakes of public figures 'are relatively routine,' they also tend not to be believable. Layers of lies At the center of the cryptocurrency scam impersonating VOA is an intriguing promise and a trail of stolen accounts spanning the globe. The fake story claims that Durov told Carlson about his latest creation: ProTON-Invest, an open program that will allow even the least financially literate person to earn large sums of money with minimal effort. VOA attempted to trace the origins of the ProTON-Invest scheme and its promotional content, but the fraudsters had done a good job covering their tracks. When VOA approached the owners of the Facebook accounts that bought advertising for the scheme, those who responded said they had lost access to their pages. One of the accounts, called 'Simply News' in Russian, had previously been the page of a business in Calumpit, a provincial city in the Philippines, that sold house plants and baked goods during the coronavirus pandemic. The business’s co-owner, Dannie Roxas, told VOA that the page had been hacked. 'We do not have any access to it and we cannot take it back anymore,' she said in a Telegram message. 'We already have reported it.' Another Facebook page promoting the scam (but without the fake VOA story) was 'Golden News.' It formerly belonged to a travel agency in Kabul, Afghanistan. VOA wrote to the agency over WhatsApp. A man who did not identify himself said the most recent posts were not from the company and they had likely been hacked. When VOA inquired further, he declined to provide more information. VOA also identified several more accounts sharing the fake transcript or pushing the fraud scheme. Two appeared to belong to a graphic designer in the Punjab region of Pakistan. He did not respond to a request for comment. Another belonged to a Mexican rapper. The man behind that page did not respond to a request for comment but had previously written from his personal Facebook page that his music account was hacked. According to Facebook’s Page Transparency data, the stolen accounts often had managers supposedly located in multiple countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ukraine, China and the U.S. But it’s unclear how Facebook determines where the managers are located. Meta did not respond to a question from VOA about that. If the determination is based on an IP address, that can easily be spoofed using a virtual private network (VPN), a basic tool for maintaining privacy online. Trouble fighting back At its core, the ProTON-Invest scam appears to benefit from the current online environment. When hackers take over an account, they often change the password, recovery email and phone number. That makes it extremely difficult to retake the account. After cryptocurrency scammers took over his Facebook account in early 2024, it took journalist Yuri – who asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss the hack without his employer’s permission – nearly six months to regain control. Ultimately, he had to hire a lawyer to engage with Facebook parent company Meta. 'If the lawyer hadn’t helped me, I would have spent a long time writing to Meta,' Yuri said. The scams are also relatively inexpensive to create. Facebook advertising costs very little, according to Snopes’ Liles. Meanwhile, people who fall victim to the scams give them hundreds or even thousands of dollars. 'If [the scammer] spent only $100, their scam has, unfortunately, been successful,' Liles told VOA. So, how can internet users distinguish a scam from real VOA? Besides looking for an accurate VOA URL in the web address of any supposed VOA page, users should also look for specific signs that VOA social media pages are legitimate. 'In our branding, VOA uses specific colors, and the social media accounts’ names are the same across platforms. On Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, look for the verification check mark, and follow links to other social media platforms from our website or official social media accounts,' a representative of VOA Public Relations said. 'On X, not all of our accounts are verified because they require a paid subscription, so always crosscheck the link on the website or official social media accounts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-scammers-use-fake-voa-article-to-push-russian-cryptocurrency-scheme/7949807.html	2025-01-25T23:29:14-08:00	
Taipei pet shop strives to break down anti-snake prejudice	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the Year of the Snake approaches, a pet store in Taipei is offering adventurous customers an opportunity to enjoy the company of snakes while sipping coffee, hoping to break down some of the prejudice against the animal. Taiwan has been plastered with images of the reptile ahead of the start of the Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday and whose zodiac animal this year is the snake. The snake has a mixed reputation in traditional Taiwanese and Chinese culture as a symbol of either good or bad. Some of Taiwan's Indigenous peoples venerate snakes as guardian spirits, and while the island is home to species potentially deadly to humans, including vipers and cobras, deaths are rare given the wide availability of anti-venom. Luo Chih-yu, 42, the owner of the Taipei pet shop Pythonism which opened in 2017, is offering potential snake owners the chance to interact with snakes over a cup of coffee. 'I provide a space for people to try and experience, finding out whether they like them without any prejudice,' he said. Liu Ting-chih took his daughter to the shop, who looked curiously at the animals in their cages. 'Through this activity she can learn how to take care of small animals and cherish them,' Liu said. Sub-tropical and mountainous Taiwan is home to some 60 native snake species.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-pet-shop-strives-to-break-down-anti-snake-prejudice-/7949837.html	2025-01-25T23:28:31-08:00	
Indonesia showcases returned artifacts it had sought for decades from Netherlands	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Centuries-old stone Buddha statues and precious jewelry repatriated by the Dutch government to its former colony are on display at Indonesia's National Museum, providing a glimpse into the country's rich heritage that the government had struggled to retrieve. The collection is part of more than 800 artifacts that were returned under a Repatriation Agreement signed in 2022 between Indonesia and the Netherlands, said Gunawan, the museum's head of cultural heritage. The objects are not just those looted in conflict but also those seized by scientists and missionaries or smuggled by mercenaries during the four centuries of colonial rule. 'I was so amazed that we have all of these artifacts,' said Shaloom Azura, a visitor to the museum in Jakarta. She hoped other historical objects can be repatriated too, 'so we don't have to go to the Netherlands just to see our own cultural heritage.' The agreement to return cultural objects was inspired by the new era of global restitution and repatriation efforts. In 2021, France said it was returning statues, royal thrones and sacred altars taken from the West African nation of Benin. Belgium returned a gold-capped tooth belonging to the slain Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba. Cambodia in 2023 welcomed the return of priceless stolen artifacts that had been seized during periods of war and instability. Many of the items returned so far have come from the United States. And the Berlin museum authority said it would return hundreds of human skulls from the former German colony of East Africa. The Dutch government announced the same year the return of the Indonesian treasures and looted artifacts from Sri Lanka. Few objects made it back before deal was struck The repatriation 'is not something out of the blue' but followed a lengthy process, said I Gusti Agung Wesaka Puja, former Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands who also headed the government's team tasked to recover the objects. He said negotiations with the Dutch government have been ongoing since Indonesia's independence in August 1945, but it was only in July 2022 that Indonesia formally requested the return of its cultural objects with a list of specific items. 'This repatriation is important for us to reconstruct history that may be lost or obscured or manipulated,' Puja said. 'And we can fill the gap of the historical vacuum that has existed so far.' The Dutch government in 1978 returned the famous 13th-century statue of Princess Pradnya Paramita from the Javanese Singhasari Kingdom. During the same visit to Indonesia, then-Queen Juliana also returned a saddle and spear seized from Prince Diponegoro, a Javanese nobleman considered a national hero for his struggle against colonial rule in the 19th century. The prince's scepter was returned in 2015. In 2020, Dutch King Willem-Alexander handed over Diponegoro's gold-plated kris dagger in his first state visit to Indonesia. Also pending is the return of the 'Java Man' — the first known example of homo erectus that was collected by Dutch paleoanthropologist Eugene Dubois in the 19th century. 'The importance of the most recent repatriation is knowledge creation, that will give society a more complete knowledge of our past history,' said Puja. He said the recent repatriation efforts seem to also be motivated by practical considerations, such as when the Delf city administration sent back 1,500 objects in 2019. They were part of the bankrupted Nusantara Museum collection. Focus on protection of repatriated artifacts However, Marc Gerritsen, the Dutch ambassador to Indonesia, said the repatriation would only focus on cultural objects that are requested, rather than emptying out European museums. 'There is a huge interest from the Dutch public in Indonesian history and Indonesian culture, so we do know that if Dutch museums put these objects on display, there will be an interest,' Gerritsen said, 'But again, the heart of the matter is that the colonial collections artifacts that were stolen during the colonial period are returned on the basis of this process that was established.' He said the Netherlands, the largest investor from the European Union in Indonesia, has a unique relationship with Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 'Of course, we have elements of which we are not proud, but we are really grateful for the fact that Indonesia is so much attached to preserving that history,' Gerritsen said. To support its former colony in safeguarding its repatriated cultural heritage, the Dutch government has offered to assist in improving museum storage conditions and staff expertise. Some researchers have criticized Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation of 17,000 islands, for a lack of legal framework to protect its rich cultural heritage and natural conservation. At least 11 cases of museum theft were reported between 2010 and 2020, according to a 2023 report by Rucitarahma Ristiawan, a lecturer of cultural science at Gajah Mada University, and two other researchers. In 2023, dozens of ships dredged the bottom of the Batanghari River in Jambi province, and the crews looted archaeological objects including porcelain, coins, metal and gold artifacts, which are believed to have been sold abroad, the report said. 'I think there is a lot to be reviewed from our historical works that are still kept in other countries,' said Frengky Simanjuntak, who marveled at the Repatriation Exhibition at the National Museum, on display since October. 'So it's not just about bringing them back home, but how to protect them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-showcases-returned-artifacts-it-had-sought-for-decades-from-netherlands-/7949888.html	2025-01-25T23:27:56-08:00	
Polls open in Belarus with Lukashenko set to extend 30-year rule	MINSK, BELARUS — Belarusians began voting Sunday, with President Alexander Lukashenko expected to cruise to victory unchallenged for a seventh term, prolonging his three-decade authoritarian rule. Lukashenko, a 70-year-old former collective farm boss, has been in power in reclusive, Moscow-allied Belarus since 1994. Polls opened at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT) in Minsk's first presidential vote since Lukashenko suppressed mass protests against his rule in 2020. He has since allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022. The opposition and the West said Lukashenko rigged the last vote and the authorities cracked down on demonstrations, with more than a thousand people still jailed. All of Lukashenko's political opponents are either in prison -- some held incommunicado -- or in exile along with tens of thousands of Belarusians who have fled since 2020. 'All our opponents and enemies should understand: do not hope, we will never repeat what we had in 2020,' Lukashenko told a stadium in Minsk during a carefully choreographed ceremony Friday. Belarusians hope for 'no war' Most people in Belarus have only distant memories of life in the landlocked country before Lukashenko, who was 39 when he won the first national election in Belarus since it gained independence from the Soviet Union. Criticism of the strongman is banned in Belarus. Most people AFP spoke to in Minsk and other towns voiced support for him but were still fearful of giving their surnames. The other candidates running against Lukashenko have been picked to give the election an air of democracy and few know who they are. 'I will vote for Lukashenko because things have improved since he became president [in 1994],' said 42-year-old farmer Alexei in the tiny village of Gubichi in southeastern Belarus. He earns around 300 euros a month selling milk. But, like many in Belarus, he is worried about the war in neighboring Ukraine. In 2022, Russian troops entered Ukraine from several directions, including from Belarus. The following year, Russia sent tactical nuclear weapons to the country, which borders NATO countries. Alexei said he wished 'for there not to be a war.' The government's narrative has been to say that Lukashenko guaranteed peace and order in Belarus, accusing 2020 street protest leaders of sowing chaos. 'Farce' The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020 -- mostly to Poland and Lithuania -- out of a population of 9 million. They will not be able to cast ballots, with Belarus having scrapped voting abroad. Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya denounced the vote as a 'farce' in a January interview with AFP. Her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, has been held incommunicado for almost a year. She urged dissidents to prepare for an opportunity to change their country but conceded 'it was not the moment.' In the run-up to the election, the Lukashenko administration pardoned around 200 political prisoners. But former prisoners AFP spoke to say those released are under the close watch of security services and are unable to lead a normal life. Nobel Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is among those in prison in Belarus. Reliant on Russia While Lukashenko once carefully balanced his relations between the European Union and Moscow, since 2020 he has become politically and economically reliant on Russia. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called the election a 'sham' in a posting on X Saturday and said, 'Lukashenko doesn't have any legitimacy.' Known as 'Europe's last dictator' -- a nickname he embraces -- Lukashenko's Belarus has retained much of the Soviet Union's traditions and infrastructure. Unlike in Russia, the KGB security agency has kept its haunting name and Belarus still applies the death penalty. The country's economy is largely state-planned and Lukashenko scrapped Belarus's white-red-white flag in the 1990s -- which has since become the symbol of the opposition. Lukashenko prides himself for having kept the country's Soviet-era industries and agriculture enterprises in state hands. In his speech on Friday, he spoke about the 'pyatiletka' (Five Year Plan) -- an economic term used in the Soviet Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-belarus-with-lukashenko-set-to-extend-30-year-rule/7950578.html	2025-01-25T23:05:19-08:00	
WHO chief urges end to attacks on Sudan health care after 70 drone strike kills 70	The head of the World Health Organization called on Saturday for an end to attacks on health care workers and facilities in Sudan after a drone attack on a hospital in Sudan's North Darfur region killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens. 'As the only functional hospital in El Fasher, the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital provides services which include gyn-obstetrics, internal medicine, surgery and pediatrics, along with a nutrition stabilization center,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X after the Friday strike. 'We continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,' Tedros said. The war between Sudan's army and the Rapid Support Forces, which broke out in April 2023 due to disputes over the integration of the two forces, has killed tens of thousands, driven millions from their homes and plunged half of the population into hunger. The conflict has produced waves of ethnically driven violence blamed largely on the RSF, creating a humanitarian crisis. Darfur Governor Mini Minnawi said on X that an RSF drone had struck the emergency department of the hospital in the capital of North Darfur, killing patients, including women and children. Fierce clashes have erupted in El Fasher between the RSF and the Sudanese joint forces, including the army, armed resistance groups, police, and local defense units.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-urges-end-to-attacks-on-sudan-health-care-after-70-drone-strike-kills-70/7950576.html	2025-01-25T22:25:24-08:00	
Trump discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30 days	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days. 'I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great interest in TikTok,' Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight to Florida. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the discussions said Trump's administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's operations. Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters. However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he had not spoken to Oracle's Larry Ellison about buying the app. Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other investors to save TikTok, Trump said: 'No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.' The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as well as other regions. National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for TikTok's global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment. The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance's current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance's U.S. backers. Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment. Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said. Oracle responsible Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users' information to alleviate Washington's worries about Chinese government interference. TikTok's management would remain in place, to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources. The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19. Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported. Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake 'in the tens of billions,' but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying. Trump has said he 'would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture' in TikTok. NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House. Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden. The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days/7950571.html	2025-01-25T21:00:57-08:00	
Rubio threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan's Taliban leaders, sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in the country than previously thought. The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S. President Joe Biden. The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media, in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald Trump. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio wrote on X. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden,' he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces in 2011. Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions. In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022. Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little information has been released. The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life sentence in a California prison. Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the secretary of state to offer up to $50 million. No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan. Harder line on Taliban? Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a 'peacemaker.' In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and negotiated directly with the Taliban -- with Trump even proposing a summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat -- as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America's longest war. Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just after U.S. troops left. The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden, especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the city's airport. The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban government representatives but made little headway. Some members of Trump's Republican Party criticized even the limited U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and never routed through the Taliban. Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor on Thursday said he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the persecution of women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans/7950570.html	2025-01-25T20:41:40-08:00	
Trump wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more refugees	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday he'd like to see Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip — potentially moving out enough of the population to 'just clean out' the war-torn area to create a virtual clean slate. During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump also said he's ended his predecessor's hold on sending 907-kilogram bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point that had been meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire. 'We released them today,' Trump said of the bombs. 'They've been waiting for them for a long time.' Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, 'Because they bought them.' Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump said. 'You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'' Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, 'I'd love for you to take on more, ‘cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.' He said of such a mass movement of Palestinians, 'it could be temporary or long term,' adding that the area of the world that encompasses Gaza, has 'had many, many conflicts' over centuries. 'Something has to happen,' Trump said. 'But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there.' He added: 'So, I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' There was no immediate comment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Trump has offered nontraditional views on the future of Gaza in the past. He suggested after he was inaugurated on Monday that Gaza has 'really got to be rebuilt in a different way.' The new president added then, 'Gaza is interesting. It's a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It's like, some beautiful things could be done with it, but it's very interesting.' His resuming delivery of large bombs, meanwhile, is a break with then-President Joe Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled. 'Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,' Biden told CNN in May when he held up the weapons. 'I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.' The Biden pause had also held up 1,700 227-kilogram bombs that had been packaged in the same shipment to Israel, but weeks later those bombs were delivered. Trump's action comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an enduring halt to the fighting. The Israeli government has threatened to resume its war against Hamas — which launched a massive assault against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — if the remaining hostages are not released.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-jordan-and-egypt-to-accept-more-refugees/7950563.html	2025-01-25T20:20:08-08:00	
Rain in California will aid firefighters, create risk of toxic runoff	LOS ANGELES — Rain began falling in parched Southern California on Saturday in a boon for firefighters who were mopping up multiple wildfires. But heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring the threat of new troubles like toxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires. The two fires reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on January 7. Most of the region was expected to get about 2.5 centimeters of precipitation over several days, but 'the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario' of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. 'So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,' weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. 'That could be enough to create debris flows.' The rain started along the Central Coast before moving into Ventura and LA counties in the evening. It was forecast to increase throughout the weekend and possibly last into early Tuesday, Smith said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, and snow was likely in the mountains. Leaders take steps to speed cleanup Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order this week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. Los Angeles County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas. Fire crews filled sandbags for communities while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito up the coast from LA was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Twenty-three people died, and hundreds of homes were damaged. Several fires continue burning While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and dry conditions, several wildfires were still burning across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81%, and the Eaton Fire was at 95% containment. In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. And in San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire churning through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began October 1, the Los Angeles Times reported. Most of Southern California is now either in 'extreme drought' or 'severe drought,' according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rain-expected-in-california-will-aid-firefighting-but-could-lead-to-toxic-runoff-/7950548.html	2025-01-25T18:24:56-08:00	
CIA: COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in report	WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. The CIA 'continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' the agency wrote in a statement about its new assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was 'pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation,' and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment. 'Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,' Cotton said in a statement. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus 'most likely' spread after escaping from a lab. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that could change its assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report-/7950532.html	2025-01-25T17:28:11-08:00	
North Korea tests sea-to-surface cruise missiles, state media says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea has test-fired sea-to-surface strategic guided cruise missiles, state news agency KCNA reported Sunday, adding that the weapons 'precisely' hit their targets. 'The war deterrence means of the armed forces of the DPRK are being perfected more thoroughly,' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said as he oversaw Saturday's test, the agency reported. The missiles hit their marks after travelling along the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) elliptical and figure-eight orbits, the report said, adding that there was 'no negative impact on the security of neighboring countries.' KCNA did not say where the test took place. The weapons test by Pyongyang was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday. Shortly before his inauguration, North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the sea. Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim during his first term in office, said in an interview aired Thursday that he would reach out to Kim again, calling the North Korean leader a 'smart guy.' The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of United Nations sanctions. On Sunday, KCNA carried a statement from North Korea's foreign ministry criticizing Washington and Seoul, South Korea, for carrying out joint military drills in recent days. 'The reality stresses that the DPRK should counter the U.S. with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK,' the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym. 'This is the best option for dealing with the U.S.' Such joint military exercises regularly infuriate the nuclear-armed North, which decries them as rehearsals for invasion. In late October, North Korea test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It then fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles days later. U.S. and South Korean intelligence also believe that North Korea started in October to send thousands of troops to fight against Ukraine and has since suffered hundreds of casualties. Neither North Korea nor Russia has officially confirmed that Pyongyang's forces are fighting for Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nkorea-test-fires-sea-to-surface-strategic-cruise-missile-state-media-says-/7950531.html	2025-01-25T17:17:09-08:00	
Haitian leader: Trump administration's deportation plans will be 'catastrophic'	ROME — The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council said the Trump administration's decisions to freeze aid programs, deport migrants and block refugees will be 'catastrophic' for Haiti. Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti. 'I'm knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves Haiti, and he is eager to help,' Haiti's interim president said. The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with impunity. Half of Haiti's 11.4 million people are already hungry, according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the situation dramatically worse. 'Trump said that Haiti is a 'shithole,' so I don't think he will care about Haiti,' Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, 'the situation will be catastrophic.' During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies that welcome 'those who can contribute to our society.' Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the 'Temporary Protection System.' 'Trump says that he will expel all of them,' Voltaire said, adding that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally displaced people, cannot handle the influx. In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the International Organization for Migration represents a record for Haiti. IOM said that 'relentless gang violence' in Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic. Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding areas. Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti's multinational police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they can go ahead with elections this year. Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country's president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers. 'We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can do the election.' The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, 'I don't think they should be around the table.' More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-leader-trump-administration-s-deportation-plans-will-be-catastrophic-/7950530.html	2025-01-25T17:12:36-08:00	
US migrant deportation flights arrive in Latin America	GUATEMALA CITY, GUATEMALA — U.S. military planes carrying dozens of expelled migrants arrived in Guatemala, authorities said Friday, as President Donald Trump moved to crack down on illegal immigration. A total of 265 Guatemalans arrived on three flights — two operated by the military, and one a charter, the Central American country's migration institute said, updating earlier figures. Washington also sent four deportation flights to Mexico on Thursday, the White House press secretary said on X, despite multiple U.S. media reports that authorities there had turned at least one plane back. The Mexican government has not confirmed either the arrival of flights or any agreement to receive a specific number of planes with deportees. But Mexico's foreign ministry said Friday it was ready to work with Washington over the deportation of its citizens, saying the country would 'always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms.' The flights came as the White House said it had arrested more than 1,000 people in two days with hundreds deported by military aircraft, saying that 'the largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway.' Some 538 illegal immigrant 'criminals' were arrested Thursday, it said, followed by another 593 on Friday. By comparison, under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden deportation flights were carried out regularly, with a total of 270,000 deportations in 2024 — a 10-year record — and 113,400 arrests, making an average of 310 per day. 'Bad, hard criminals' The Guatemalan government did not confirm whether any of the migrants arrested this week were among the deportees that arrived Friday. 'These are flights that took place after Trump took office,' an official in the Guatemalan vice president's office told AFP. A Pentagon source told AFP that 'overnight, two DOD (Department of Defense) aircraft conducted repatriation flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.' Early Friday the White House posted an image on X of men in shackles being marched into a military aircraft, with the caption: 'Deportation flights have begun.' Trump told reporters that the flights were to get 'the bad, hard criminals out.' 'Murderers, people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you've seen,' he said. Friday's deportees were taken to a reception center at an air force base in Guatemala's capital, away from the media. Crackdown a campaign promise Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States. On his first day in office, he signed orders declaring a 'national emergency' at the southern border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport 'criminal aliens.' His administration said it would also reinstate a 'Remain in Mexico' policy under which people who apply to enter the United States from Mexico must remain there until their application has been decided. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Friday on X that program had been reinstated, and that Mexico had deployed some 30,000 National Guard troops to its border. The Mexican foreign ministry did not confirm either claim in its statement. The White House has also halted an asylum program for people fleeing authoritarian regimes in Central and South America, leaving thousands of people stranded on the Mexican side of the border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-migrant-deportation-flights-arrive-in-latin-america-/7950341.html	2025-01-25T15:58:54-08:00	
Italy's Meloni defends repatriation of Libyan warlord wanted by ICC	ROME — Italy's prime minister addressed growing criticism Saturday of the repatriation of a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, as Giorgia Meloni cited an appeals court order and security concerns. The repatriation of Ossama Anjiem to Libya, a key partner in Europe's efforts to keep migrants from crossing the Mediterranean and landing on its shores, sparked outrage from human rights groups and questions from Italy's opposition parties. Meloni said her government will ask the ICC to clarify why it took months to issue the arrest warrant for Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, and why it was issued only after he traveled through at least three European countries. 'Al-Masri was released by an order of Rome's Court of Appeal ... It was not a government choice,' Meloni told journalists during a trip to Saudi Arabia. Italy has close ties to Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli and relies on it to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Any trial of al-Masri in The Hague could bring unwanted attention to Italy's migration policies and its support of Libya's coast guard. Al-Masri leads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Deterrence Forces. He was arrested Sunday in Turin, where he reportedly attended the Juventus-Milan soccer match the night before. The ICC warrant, dated the day before his arrest, accused al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Mitiga prison, starting in 2015, that are punishable with life in prison. The court said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence. The prison holds political dissidents, migrants and others. Human rights groups for years have documented abuses in Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept. The ICC said the arrest warrant was transmitted to member states Saturday, including Italy, and that the court had told Italy to contact it 'without delay' if it ran into problems cooperating with the warrant. But Rome's court of appeals ordered al-Masri freed Tuesday, citing a 'procedural error' in his arrest. The ruling said Justice Minister Carlo Nordio should have been informed ahead of time since the ministry handles all relations with the ICC. Al-Masri was sent to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services. The ICC said it had not been given prior notice of the appeals court's decision, as required, and was 'yet to obtain verification from the authorities on the steps reportedly taken.' Meloni said Italy's government, 'faced with a dangerous individual, decided to expel him immediately and, as it happens in many cases with dangerous prisoners who are repatriated, didn't use a regular flight, also for passengers' safety.' She said Italy will provide all needed clarifications to the ICC. Opposition parties have asked Meloni to urgently explain the 'very serious' development, while calling on the justice minister to resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-meloni-defends-repatriation-of-libyan-warlord-wanted-by-icc-/7950350.html	2025-01-25T15:49:55-08:00	
Trump restores US participation in two anti-abortion pacts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump used his executive authority Friday to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the 'global gag rule' because they say it silences pro-choice advocates. Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to each of the 50 states. Trump said in his memorandum Friday he was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy 'to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.' Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts other forms of health care access and blocks nongovernmental organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their own money on abortion care. Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said research showed that the order has led to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended impact. 'Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United States back in advancing gender equality,' Madan Keller said, in part by limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the workforce. Rubio also announced Friday the United States was rejoining the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion access for millions of women and girls around the world. The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil, Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories. The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better health care for women and the preservation of human life, while also strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting each nation's sovereignty. The State Department said Friday that one of the four objectives of the pact was to 'protect life at all stages.' Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden's executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion. 'While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion access to people with low incomes,' the women's health care provider Planned Parenthood said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-restores-us-participation-in-two-anti-abortion-pacts-/7950342.html	2025-01-25T15:43:19-08:00	
Tens of thousands protest Germany's far right as Musk endorses AfD	HALLE, GERMANY — Tens of thousands of Germans rallied Saturday against the far right ahead of next month's legislative elections, as U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk again endorsed the anti-immigrant AfD party. Musk, speaking by video link, told thousands of AfD supporters gathered in the eastern city of Halle that their party was 'the best hope for the future of Germany.' AfD supporters at the rally shouted their approval as party co-leader Alice Weidel looked on smiling. Meanwhile, protesters against the AfD turned out in cities across Germany. The largest gatherings took place in Berlin and Cologne, police revising their turnout figures upward to 35,000 and 40,000 respectively. The protesters in Berlin used their mobile phones to form 'a sea of light for democracy' in front of the Brandenburg Gate, holding letters forming the word 'Resistance.' AfD polling a record AfD is polling at about 20% before Germany's February 23 elections, a record for a party that has shattered a decades-old taboo in post-war Germany against supporting the far right. The mainstream conservative CDU/CSU alliance leads with about 30%, with CDU leader Friedrich Merz the favorite to become chancellor after the elections. Musk, a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, told the AfD rally the election was important. 'I think it could decide the entire fate of Europe, maybe the fate of the world,' he said. Musk has rattled European politicians in recent weeks with comments on his social platform X supporting AfD and far-right politicians in other countries, including Britain. Like Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics, and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it claims limit free speech. Peaceful protests The anti-AfD rallies took place in about 60 towns following calls from a variety of organizations, attracting more people than the police expected. The protests passed peacefully, with banners saying, 'Nazis out' or 'AfD is not an alternative,' a reference to the far-right party's full name 'Alternative for Germany.' The CDU's Merz also came in for criticism. Many protesters fear he is tempted to break his party's policy of refusing to enter into coalition talks with the AfD. There was also a protest in the southern city of Aschaffenbourg, where a deadly knife attack recently by an Afghan migrant further inflamed the debate over immigration. Several thousand also turned out in the eastern city of Halle, where the AfD rally was addressed by Musk, leading to a few incidents. Halle police said they had opened criminal investigations for offenses including assault, insults and disrupting traffic. They said they would also be taking action against 21 people who tried to force a barrier.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-germany-s-far-right-as-musk-endorses-afd-/7950330.html	2025-01-25T15:38:27-08:00	
Trump visits Las Vegas casino to promote his plan to not tax tips	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — President Donald Trump capped a frenzied first week back in office with a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday to talk about cutting taxes on tips, a 2024 campaign promise he made in the gambling and hospitality hub. Trump took the stage before cheering supporters at the Circa Resort and Casino in front of a large banner reading 'No Tax on Tips' and said economic confidence was soaring in the United States. 'America's decline is over,' he said at the start of his remarks, echoing themes from his inauguration remarks earlier in the week. Since taking office Monday, the new Republican president reversed a myriad of policies put in place by Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and moved to fulfill his vow of remaking and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. In visits Friday to disaster areas in North Carolina and California, Trump pledged federal aid to help those states recover from hurricane and wildfires after floating an idea to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Las Vegas, Trump's event was designed to highlight a less controversial pledge to end taxation of income from tips and overtime, a proposal he first made in June as he courted service workers in the presidential swing state of Nevada. The tip-heavy hospitality industry comprises more than a fifth of jobs. 'Can you remember that little statement about tips?' Trump said during one of several inauguration day speeches Monday. 'Anybody remember that little statement? I think we won Nevada because of that statement.' Michael McDonald, Nevada Republican Party chairman, said the idea is attractive to people in the state who are facing high prices for essential goods like food and gas. 'He cares about the no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security. That was something that we brought to the community, and everybody loved it because we're all hurting,' McDonald told local television after welcoming Trump on Friday night. Trump promised to pursue an aggressive agenda of tax cuts if re-elected, which may face some hurdles even in a U.S. Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans. The proposals Trump made on the campaign trail — from extending his 2017 tax cuts to abolishing tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits — could add $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs on imported goods to help pay for extending trillions of dollars in tax cuts, an unprecedented shift likely to face opposition from Republican budget hawks concerned about the reliability and durability of tariff revenue. Days before he returned to office, some of his Republican allies in Congress warned that Trump's aggressive tax-cut agenda could fall victim to signs of worry in the bond market. At a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Republicans in the House of Representatives aired concerns that the estimated $4 trillion cost over the next 10 years of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts could undermine the U.S. government's ability to service its $36 trillion in debt, which is growing at a pace of $2 trillion a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-las-vegas-casino-to-promote-his-plan-to-not-tax-tips-/7950335.html	2025-01-25T15:10:50-08:00	
Red Cross: Yemen's Houthi rebels freed 153 war detainees	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels unilaterally freed 153 war detainees Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said, one of several overtures in recent days to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Previous prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jumpstart talks over permanently ending Yemen's decadelong war, which began when the Houthis seized the country's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, the Houthis' release comes just after they detained another seven Yemeni workers from the United Nations, sparking anger from the world body. Those released previously had been visited by Red Cross staff in Sanaa and received medical checks and other assistance, the organization said while announcing the release. The Houthis had signaled Friday night they planned the release of prisoners. The Red Cross said it 'welcomes this unilateral release as another positive step towards reviving negotiations.' 'This operation has brought much-needed relief and joy to families who have been anxiously waiting for the return of their loved ones,' said Christine Cipolla, the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen. 'We know that many other families are also waiting for their chance to be reunited. We hope that today's release will lead to many more moments like this.' Abdul Qader al-Murtada, the head of the Houthis' Committee for Prisoners' Affairs, said in a statement carried by Houthi media that those released were 'humanitarian cases' that included the sick, wounded and the elderly. 'The goal of the initiative is to build trust and establish a new phase of serious and honest dealing,' al-Murtada reportedly said. The Red Cross has helped oversee other prisoner releases, including one that saw some 1,000 prisoners swapped in 2020, over 800 detainees exchanged in 2023 and another release in 2024. The rebels said earlier this week they would limit their attacks on ships in the Red Sea corridor and released the 25-member crew of the Galaxy Leader, a ship they seized in November 2023, as the first Gaza ceasefire took hold. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The Houthis' attacks on shipping during the Israel-Hamas war have helped deflect attention from their problems at home. But they have faced casualties and damage from U.S.-led airstrikes targeting the group for months now, as well as other strikes by Israel. Meanwhile, Yemen's economy is in tatters, something that's put increasing pressure on the Houthis and others in the conflict to potentially negotiate an end to the war. A de facto ceasefire in the conflict, which drew in a Saudi-led coalition in 2015, has largely held for several years now even during the Houthis attacks over the Israel-Hamas war. Yet the Houthis still conducted the raids that saw seven U.N. workers detained, likely alongside others. The rebels previously detained U.N. staffers, as well as individuals associated with the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital, aid groups and civil society. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres late Friday demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the seven, as well as all other U.N. workers held by the Houthis, some since 2021. 'The continued targeting of U.N. personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen,' he warned in a statement. 'The Houthis must deliver on their previous commitments and act in the best interests of the Yemeni people and the overall efforts to achieve peace in Yemen.' The U.N. has halted work in Yemen, which provides food, medicine and other aid to the impoverished nation. U.S. President Donald Trump separately has moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. Analysts have linked the newest U.N. detentions as being connected to the decision, though the Houthis themselves have yet to comment on them. The rebels have been airing repeated programs on television channels they control parading people they describe as working with Western intelligence agencies or the Israelis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/red-cross-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-freed-153-war-detainees-/7950328.html	2025-01-25T14:52:47-08:00	
Trump fires independent inspectors general at US agencies	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent inspectors general at U.S. government agencies, a sweeping action to remove oversight of his new administration that some members of Congress are suggesting violates federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately, according to two people familiar with the action. They spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. Neither confirmed the exact number of firings, but an email sent by one of the fired inspectors general said 'roughly 17' inspectors general had been removed. Congress was not given 30-day notices about the removals — something that even a top Republican is decrying. 'There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,' Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. 'I'd like further explanation from President Trump. Regardless, the 30-day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress,' said Grassley, a Republican. The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that the firings violated statutes but shrugged it off: 'Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,' he said. Democrats and watchdog groups, however, used the dismissals to raise alarm that Trump was making it easier to take advantage of the government. 'Inspectors General are the cops on the beat preventing bad things from happening,' Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said in a statement. 'Their work saves the taxpayer tens of billions of dollars every year.' The White House did not comment Saturday. Trump was in Las Vegas for a speech focused on his campaign promise to end federal taxation on tips. But the moves were consistent with Trump's first week back in the White House, which has featured a series of steps to remake the federal government. He has used executive orders to impose hiring freezes, cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and suggested he wants to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency and leave disaster recovery up to individual states affected by major emergencies. 'Yesterday, in the dark of night, President Trump fired at least 12 independent inspector generals at important federal agencies across the administration,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Saturday on the chamber's floor. 'This is a chilling purge and it's a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration are taking far too often as he's becoming president.' The Washington Post, which first reported the firings, said that many were appointees from Trump's first term. Among those inspectors general reportedly removed included those for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense and Education. Spared in this round of dismissals, however, was Michael Horowitz, the longtime Justice Department inspector general who has issued reports on assorted politically explosive criminal investigations over the past decade. In December 2019, for instance, Horowitz released a report faulting the FBI for surveillance warrant applications in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. But the report also found that the investigation had been opened for a legitimate purpose and did not find evidence that partisan bias had guided investigative decisions. Horowitz's status aside, the move against the watchdogs drew criticism from congressional Democrats. Still, Trump has aggressively challenged the authority of independent agency watchdog groups in the past. In 2020, he replaced multiple key inspectors general, including those leading the Defense Department and intelligence community, as well as the inspector general tapped to chair a special oversight board for the $2.2 trillion economic relief package on the coronavirus. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Trump's actions 'a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night.' 'Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste, fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct,' Warren posted on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7950316.html	2025-01-25T14:50:17-08:00

Big Tech wants data centers plugged into power plants; utilities balk	HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else. It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly. Front and center is the data center that Amazon's cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania. The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS — called a 'behind the meter' connection — is the first to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts — about 40% of the plant's capacity — to the data center. That's enough to power more than 500,000 homes. That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on procedural grounds, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things. 'The companies, they're very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that's really big,' said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. 'And if they're delayed five years in the queue, for example — I don't know if it would be five years, but years anyway — they might completely miss the business opportunity.' Driving demand for energy-hungry data centers The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors, and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste. Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race. For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as coal, oil or gas-fueled plants. Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels. They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said. Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines. What's in it for power providers In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna's majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power. The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they've been forced to compete in some markets flooded with cheap natural gas and state-subsidized solar and wind energy. Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else. FERC's big decision A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say. FERC's 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study. In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal. Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be 'extreme' if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory. Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said. Separately, two electric utility owners — which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power — have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe. Susquehanna's owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services — and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others. FERC's decision will have 'massive repercussions for the entire country' because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly. 'The timing of this issue is before us,' she said, 'and if we take our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-tech-wants-data-centers-plugged-into-power-plants-utilities-balk-/7950310.html	2025-01-25T14:10:17-08:00	
9 South African soldiers killed as conflict in eastern Congo escalates	Nine South African soldiers have been killed in eastern Congo's conflict zone, the South African defense department said Saturday, as Congolese troops and peacekeepers battled to stop an advance by Rwanda-backed rebels on the city of Goma. Democratic Republic of Congo and its allies earlier repelled an overnight advance on the provincial capital of over 1 million people, two army sources said. The sound of nearby heavy bombardment rocked the city in the early hours. The three-year M23 insurgency in Democratic Republic of Congo's mineral-rich east has intensified in January with rebels seizing control of more territory than ever before, prompting the United Nations to warn of the risk of a broader regional war. As of Friday, two days of fierce fighting had killed two Southern Africans deployed with the U.N. peacekeeping mission and seven others in the Southern African regional bloc's force in Congo, the South African National Defense Force said in a statement. 'The members put up a brave fight to prevent the rebels from proceeding to Goma as was their intention,' it said, adding that the M23 rebels had been pushed back. The deaths follow an escalation in hostilities that also led to the killing of North Kivu's military governor on the front line this week. The situation appeared calm in Goma on Saturday with people tentatively going about their business amid a heavy police presence, Reuters reporters there said. The Congolese government and army did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the fighting in the area. The United Nations said Saturday it had started temporarily relocating its non-essential staff from Goma due to the deteriorating security situation in the province. Hundreds of thousands flee Congo, the U.N. and others accuse neighboring Rwanda of fueling the conflict with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda denies this, but the surge in fighting has prompted renewed calls for it to disengage. 'Rwanda must cease its support for the M23 and withdraw,' the European Union said in a statement Saturday. The Rwandan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The M23 briefly managed to take over Goma during a previous rebellion in 2012, prompting international donors to cut aid to Rwanda. Even then, the rebels did not hold as much ground as they do now. The insecurity has also deepened eastern provinces' already dire humanitarian situation with 400,000 more people forced to flee their homes this year alone, according to the U.N. refugee agency. 'The situation facing Goma's civilians is becoming increasingly perilous and the humanitarian needs are enormous,' Human Rights Watch said Saturday. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet Monday to discuss the crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-soldiers-killed-as-conflict-in-eastern-congo-escalates-/7950302.html	2025-01-25T13:43:45-08:00	
Analysts say China's mistreatment of detained writer, citizen journalist part of crackdown	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Human rights advocates tell VOA that Chinese authorities' mistreatment of detained Chinese Australian writer Yang Hengjun and Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan is part of Beijing's longstanding crackdown on dissent. 'We have known for a long time that the Chinese government ill-treats and tortures people who are in detention,' said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of U.S.-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders. 'The Chinese government's consistent failure to deny people in detention adequate care and protect them from ill-treatment and torture is the norm. The fact that nobody has ever been held accountable, either domestically or internationally, for these abuses is a significant part of what enables [this trend,]' she told VOA by phone. Yang, a democracy advocate and prominent spy novelist, was tried in a secret trial under espionage charges in 2021 and given a suspended death sentence last February. Zhang, a former lawyer, was released from prison in May 2024 after serving a four-year sentence for reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in early 2020. She was arrested again in August 2024 after repeatedly calling for the release of Chinese activist Zhang Pancheng. Yang's family and friends told VOA by phone that the Australian writer, who has been in Chinese detention for six years, has been denied access to food, medical care, and other daily necessities by Chinese authorities since he was transferred from a detention center in June to the Beijing Municipal No. 2 Prison. 'Prison authorities reduced his monthly allowance from 200 yuan [approximately $27.60] to 100 yuan [approximately $13.80] last November, after he could no longer carry out his assigned chores at a factory in prison due to deteriorating eyesight and fatigue caused by a serious flu,' said Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Technology Sydney and Yang's former academic adviser. 'He doesn't have enough money to buy food and warm clothes despite his deteriorating health and the sub-zero temperature in Beijing,' Feng told VOA by phone, adding that prison authorities repeatedly have denied Yang's request for medical treatment. Yang said he did not appeal last year's death sentence because of a lack of trust in China's judicial system, and family members urged Chinese authorities to provide 'adequate and supervised medical care' for him. During a monthly consular visit last November, Yang told Australian diplomats that his prison conditions were 'harsh and unbearable,' and he urged Australian authorities to raise concerns about his situation with Chinese authorities. 'The Australian government, including the Australian Ambassador to China Scott Dewar, has repeatedly expressed concerns about Yang's conditions to the Chinese government, but Beijing hasn't responded favorably to issues raised by Canberra,' Feng said, accusing Beijing of 'intentionally torturing' his former student. With no sign of improvement in Yang's condition, the Sydney-based academic urges Australian authorities to prioritize Yang's case and be tougher with their Chinese counterparts. 'The Australian government should prioritize the rights of its citizens when dealing with China, instead of seeking to normalize economic relations with Beijing when its citizens are mistreated in the Chinese prison,' Feng told VOA. Australian authorities repeatedly have raised Yang's case during meetings with their Chinese counterparts. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called last year's imposition of a suspended death sentence 'appalling.' 'The government advocates for Dr. Yang at every opportunity, at the highest levels, and we will continue to do so,' a spokesperson for Wong told Australian media this week, adding that the efforts include advocating for Yang's access to appropriate medical care. Yang Hengjun holds a doctorate. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Australia for comments but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Hunger strike Meanwhile, Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was rearrested for public order offenses in August, reportedly has kicked off a new round of hunger strikes at a detention center in Shanghai. According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, prison authorities have force-fed Zhang through a gastric tube to keep her from becoming malnourished, an act that human rights organizations say constitutes 'torture' under international human rights conventions. This marks the second time Zhang has used a hunger strike to protest her detention. During her four-year prison sentence, which ended in May 2024, Zhang staged a monthslong hunger strike that caused her weight to drop to under 40 kilograms at one point. Teng Biao, a Chinese legal scholar and human rights lawyer based in the United States, expressed concern about Zhang's conditions in detention. 'Normally, Chinese dissidents will face harsher treatments when they are detained for the second or third time, so I'm worried about Zhang's situation in detention,' he told VOA by phone. In his view, Chinese authorities' mistreatment of Yang and Zhang reflects the escalating crackdown on dissidents in China. 'By intensifying the punishment against dissidents, the Chinese government is trying to create an authoritarian environment in which no one can criticize or challenge the authorities,' Teng said. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry and Pudong Detention Center for comments. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is 'a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected' in the country. Human rights advocate Richardson said that since the detention of dissidents has become a norm in China, democratic countries should consider increasing the price that Beijing must pay for committing human rights violations. 'Democratic governments have to be much more muscular in demanding releases and withholding aspects of the relationship that Beijing wants or finding ways to punish Beijing for refusing to release people, especially when their own citizens' lives are on the line,' she told VOA. Richardson emphasized she thinks democratic nations must regroup and discuss different punitive measures, such as international investigations, to stem systematic and widespread human rights violations in the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-china-s-mistreatment-of-detained-writer-citizen-journalist-part-of-crackdown/7950279.html	2025-01-25T13:24:46-08:00	
US Senate confirms Noem as homeland security secretary	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump's national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent's confirmation as treasury secretary. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans' top priorities,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, said Friday. 'And it's going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would vote against Noem. He pointed to 'bipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,' adding that Noem 'seems headed in the wrong direction.' The homeland security secretary oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, 'I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.' Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump's first four years in office. Noem, who held her state's lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even considered to be his running mate. Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump's favorite issue, border security. The president's goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing. She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president's orders and copied his talk of an 'invasion' at the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost. Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops 'because of this invasion,' adding that 'it is a war zone down there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-noem-as-trump-s-homeland-security-secretary-/7950252.html	2025-01-25T12:19:11-08:00	
Trump visits scenes of natural disasters in California, North Carolina		https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-scenes-of-natural-disasters-in-california-north-carolina-/7950249.html	2025-01-25T12:00:44-08:00	
Trump proposes 'getting rid of FEMA' while touring disaster areas	LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump surveyed disaster zones in California and North Carolina on Friday and said he was considering 'getting rid of' the Federal Emergency Management Agency, offering the latest sign of how he is weighing sweeping changes to the nation's central organization for responding to disasters. In fire-ravaged California, the state’s Democratic leaders pressed Trump for federal assistance that he’s threatened to hold up, some setting aside their past differences to shower him with praise. Trump, in turn, pressured local officials to waive permitting requirements so people can immediately rebuild, pledging that federal permits would be granted promptly. Instead of having federal financial assistance flow through FEMA, the Republican president said Washington could provide money directly to the states. He made the comments while visiting North Carolina, which is still recovering months after Hurricane Helene, on the first trip of his second term. 'FEMA has been a very big disappointment,' the Republican president said. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow.' Trump was greeted in California by Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump critic whom the president frequently disparages. The duo chatted amiably and gestured toward cooperation despite their history. 'We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help,' Newsom told Trump. 'You were there for us during COVID. I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations we’ll be able to work together to get a speedy recovery.' Newsom has praised Trump before when looking for help from the federal government. In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, he called Trump 'thoughtful' and 'collaborative.' Trump flew over several devastated neighborhoods in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, before landing in Pacific Palisades, a hard-hit community that’s home to some of Southern California’s rich and famous. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, he walked a street where all the houses have burned, chatting with residents and police officers. It takes seeing the damage firsthand to grasp its enormity, Trump said after. The fires, which continue to burn, could end up being the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. 'It is devastation. It really is an incineration,' Trump said. Trump’s brief but friendly interaction with Newsom belied the confrontational stance he signaled toward California earlier in the day. Even on the plane en route to Los Angeles, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was using Trump’s disparaging nickname for the governor, 'Newscum,' and telling reporters, 'He has wronged the people of his state' and saying Trump was visiting to pressure Newsom and other officials 'to do right by their citizens.' Trump said Los Angeles residents who lost their homes should be able to get back onto their properties immediately to clear them, adding several told him it will be months before they can rebuild. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should be able to return home within the week, but keeping people safe from hazardous materials is a top priority. She said the city was easing the process to get permits, but she was repeatedly interrupted by Trump as she tried to explain the city's efforts. He downplayed the concerns about toxins, saying: 'What's hazardous waste? We're going to have to define that.' Trump has a long history of minimizing the risks of asbestos. In his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, Trump called asbestos 'the greatest fireproofing material ever used' and '100% safe, once applied,' and claimed the movement against the insulator was led by the mob, 'because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal.' Before flying to California, Trump reiterated that he wants to extract concessions from the Democratic-led state in return for disaster assistance, including changes to water policies and requirements that voters need to show identification when casting ballots. Beyond Trump’s criticism of FEMA, he’s suggested limiting the federal government’s role in responding to disasters, echoing comments from conservative allies who have proposed reducing funding and responsibility. 'I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,' he said in North Carolina. 'Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.' Trump said Michael Whatley, a North Carolina native and chair of the Republican National Committee, would help coordinate recovery efforts in the state, where frustrations over the federal response have lingered. Although Whatley does not hold an official government position, Trump said he would be 'very much in charge.' FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond the state's ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap financial assistance to individual residents. Trump has criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration’s response to Helene in North Carolina. As he left the White House on Friday morning, he told reporters that 'it’s been a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester' since the storm hit in September, and 'we’re going to get it fixed up. In a small town in western North Carolina, residents told Trump about wading through waist-deep water to escape from their homes while fearing for their lives. Some have battled with insurance companies to get their losses covered. 'We’ve come to North Carolina with a simple message,' Trump said. 'You are not forgotten any longer. You were treated very badly by the previous administration.' FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to residents, but that hasn't alleviated the feeling of abandonment among residents who are struggling to rebuild their lives. Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump was 'misinformed' about an agency that provides critical help to states when they are overwhelmed by catastrophe. In addition, Coen criticized the idea of attaching strings to assistance. 'I think the American people expect the federal government will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live,' he said. Trump tapped Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited experience managing natural disasters, as FEMA’s acting director.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-proposes-getting-rid-of-fema-while-touring-disaster-areas/7950242.html	2025-01-25T10:58:52-08:00	
What South Asian nations expect from Trump	WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term gets underway, the contours of his administration's South Asia policy are taking shape: India stands front and center, while other regional countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan prepare to be sidelined. 'With the exception of India, which is a large but special case, the other countries in South Asia, I think, are positioning themselves for somewhat less attention from Washington, somewhat less predictability, and somewhat more bilateral engagement operating through multilateral organizations or multilateral channels,' said Joshua White, a former director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS. India While the Biden administration worked closely with India on a range of issues, including defense and technology, Indian officials see Trump’s return to office as an opportunity for expanded cooperation. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warm relationship, forged during Trump’s first term, promises a deeper relationship, officials and experts say. In October, Trump called Modi 'a great friend' and 'the nicest human being.' Modi reciprocated in his congratulatory message, calling Trump a 'dear friend' and pledging to work 'closely together once again.' Beyond the rapport the two leaders share, India, South Asia’s largest country, is a strategic U.S. ally and a counterweight to China’s expanding influence in Asia. The U.S. is also India’s second-largest trading partner, after China. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, both China hawks and staunch India proponents, are expected to push for deeper bilateral engagement with New Delhi. Underlying India’s importance, Rubio had his first bilateral meeting with S. Jaishankar, India’s minister of external affairs. 'There was a very visible appetite to get this relationship moving, to do more, to raise the bar, to set bigger goals,' Jaishankar said. An early focus in the U.S.-India relationship is mass deportation of undocumented Indian immigrants. India has identified 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants for repatriation to India, Bloomberg news reported this week, showing support for a Trump administration priority. There are nearly 800,000 undocumented Indians living in the U.S., including tens of thousands who illegally entered the country under the Biden administration. Jaishankar said India is opposed to illegal migration and open to the return of migrants in the U.S. illegally. Yet challenges remain in the relationship. Visa delays experienced by Indian citizens 'constrain the people-to-people interactions,' he said. Moreover, the Trump administration's pivot to other geopolitical issues, from the war in Ukraine to the relationship with China, could overshadow relations with India, experts say. 'If they have anything significant to be anxious about, apart from the immigration questions, it will be that this administration will not be as attentive to South Asia as the last administration was,' White said. Pakistan Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif used an optimistic tone on Trump’s inauguration day, pledging to work with the new president to strengthen the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. 'Over the years, our two great countries have worked together closely to pursue peace and prosperity in the region and beyond for our peoples & we shall continue to do so in the future. My best wishes to President Trump for a successful second term in office,' Sharif wrote on X Monday. To engage with the new administration, Islamabad dispatched Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington to meet with members of Trump’s foreign policy team as well as congressional leaders, Dawn, a leading Pakistani newspaper, reported Friday. Yet U.S.-Pakistan ties remain strained. Early in his first term, Trump suspended most security aid to Pakistan, accusing it of harboring terrorism, before gradually resuming cooperation as his administration began to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan’s Taliban. Complicating the prospects for improved ties between Washington and Islamabad, former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains in prison, with many members of Congress and some Trump advisers calling for his release. Alluding to those calls, a Pakistani foreign office spokesperson cautioned Thursday against interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs, even as he reiterated hopes for expanded bilateral ties. 'This is part of the principles on which interstate relations are shaped,' the spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan, said, according to Dawn. Zamir Akram, a former Pakistan ambassador, noted that Washington tends to view Islamabad through its strategic alliance with China and tensions with India. 'So, this is a difficult environment that we’ll face,' Akram said on a podcast hosted by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. Bangladesh Bangladesh presents another complex case in the Trump administration's South Asia policy formulation. Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster last August, the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, received a wide range of support from the Biden administration. That support is now on the chopping block. Yunus, who has been critical of Trump in the past, nonetheless voiced cautious optimism about bilateral cooperation with the new U.S. administration. In his congratulatory message to Trump, Yunus 'expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,' according to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry. The country’s two leading parties — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League — urged continued U.S. support for Bangladeshi democracy and development. 'As a democratic country, I expect America and other democratic nations to support and cooperate in favor of democracy,' BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told VOA. 'I believe the United States will assist in fostering democracy and development in our country.' But Mohammad A. Arafat, a member of the Awami League's central executive committee and a former state minister, criticized the Biden administration’s policy and urged a change in course. 'Unlike the Biden administration, which showed unwavering support for individuals like Dr. Yunus despite allegations of corruption, the Trump administration adopts a noninterventionist approach, refraining from interfering in other countries' internal affairs,' Arafat told VOA. VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-south-asian-nations-expect-from-trump/7950216.html	2025-01-25T10:39:20-08:00	
Taliban conditionally agree to allow Afghan girls to study in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reportedly have agreed to allow female students to pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians also are granted visas to accompany them, according to officials privy to the understanding. The revelation comes as hundreds of Afghan students took entrance examinations on Saturday to secure admission to graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs in Pakistani universities. Officials reported that Afghan refugees living in Pakistan attended designated centers in the cities of Peshawar and Quetta to take their exams, while students in Afghanistan are scheduled to participate online over the next few days. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan, announced in the lead-up to the tests that nearly 21,000 Afghan candidates, including more than 5,000 females, had submitted their applications for the upcoming summer academic sessions. His office reported 'a significant turnout' of Afghan students at the designated test centers on Saturday but did not provide specific numbers. The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan is conducting entrance tests to select up to 2,000 Afghan students, with one-third of the selected candidates being female. Pakistan expressed its 'profound gratitude' to the Kabul government 'for agreeing to allow successful female candidates to pursue their education, provided that their mahrams [chaperones] are granted visas to accompany them,' said a government official in Islamabad, requesting anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly with the media. The official stated that visas would be issued to chaperones 'to allow them to accompany female students, as mandated by Afghan law,' to study in Pakistani institutions. The Taliban did not immediately comment on Pakistani assertions that they would let Afghan girls pursue higher education in the neighboring country. Pakistan offers fully funded scholarships to thousands of students from its war-ravaged, poverty-stricken neighbor. The program for female students was halted, however, after the hardline Taliban regained power in 2021 and banned girls’ education past the sixth grade. They also prohibited Afghan women from traveling or flying without a chaperone. The Higher Education Commission website states that the scholarship program is designed to foster stronger ties with Afghanistan by providing high-quality education to Afghan students in diverse fields, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, management and computer science. The entrance examinations for Afghan students come amid bilateral tensions that have escalated lately over allegations that anti-Pakistan armed groups are using Afghan territory to launch cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban deny claims of allowing or sheltering foreign militants that threaten neighboring countries. After assuming office last month, Sadiq visited Afghanistan, where he held extensive talks with Taliban leaders on ways to stabilize bilateral political, security and trade cooperation. He described his meetings with de facto Afghan officials as productive but did not elaborate. The envoy, while addressing a gathering of Afghan and Pakistani civil society and trade representatives in Islamabad this week, said the two countries are collaborating closely to reduce tensions and enhance economic ties and trade. In addition, he said they are trying to strengthen people-to-people connections through cooperation in education and other sectors. Since sweeping back to power 3½ years ago, the Taliban have instituted sweeping restrictions on Afghan women, barring most of them from seeking public and private sector employment and requiring they cover their faces in public. The United Nations has labeled the curbs as 'gender apartheid' and persistently demanded their reversal. The Taliban defend their governance as being in line with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting criticism and calls for reversing their policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-conditionally-agree-to-allow-afghan-girls-to-study-in-pakistan/7950142.html	2025-01-25T08:23:14-08:00	
How the oldest known Hebrew book landed in a Washington museum	In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his paleography — the study of historical writing systems — when he stumbled upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking discovery. 'I recognized it immediately and said, 'That’s a manuscript in our collection,'' Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, recalls. The museum had recently acquired the manuscript — a rare Jewish prayer book — believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the late 19th century. But the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the manuscript as a '16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be from the Bamiyan area' of central Afghanistan. Stunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an Afghan warlord’s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two inside pages. 'Without Jonathan’s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998, we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,' Hepler said. But if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book's origin in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to the 8th century. 'At that point, I realized that the discovery was of major importance,' Lee said via email. Recognizing their combined expertise — Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts and Lee in Afghan history — the duo joined forces and invited in other experts. Their yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived in Afghanistan — and along the ancient Silk Roads — for longer than historians previously believed. But the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and bought on the antiquities market. At the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt. The museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript. This required years of delicate negotiations with New York’s small Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the manuscript’s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and demanding. Lee’s discovery Lee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered the book by chance. In April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted from an ancient Buddhist shrine. At the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country. The anti-Taliban group’s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking for. Lee photographed them. 'Then, his [Khalili’s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection of other antiquities that included the ALQ,' Lee said, using the acronym for the 'Afghan Liturgical Quire,' the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum’s collection. A local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to Khalili. Unversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was. 'I was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is found in Bamiyan,' Lee said. As Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved for its age. 'The cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,' he said. To Lee, that suggested the manuscript was 'not that old.' He left Afghanistan and for years didn’t give it much thought. How and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown. The 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan’s rich cultural heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men — often directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers — plundered the country’s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy percent of the national museum’s treasures vanished, according to one estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable institutions. 'There is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial times,' said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities. A leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of anonymity. Research by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2001 before 'apparently' offloading it to a private collector in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum. The office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined a VOA interview request. The Tablet article Although Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn’t know how significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th century. Then, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the 'Afghan Geniza' surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing the book as an example of 'Jewish material [turning up] occasionally' in Afghanistan, he wrote that the 'whereabouts of this manuscript is now unknown.' He would find out four years later. That's when, 'out of the blue,' Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover seder. The Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally taken out of Iraq and Egypt. The Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own, tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any ties to Afghanistan. With Lee’s documentation, the museum was able to correct its provenance. The museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century, but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the 8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous oldest-known Hebrew book in the world. The discovery electrified experts. For Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a bound Hebrew book. For Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted 'how significant this region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and Northern India, and Afghanistan's ancient connectivity with cultures and religious traditions,' Lee said. Yet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast a cloud over its legitimacy. Afghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval. To legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what it calls a 'human rights-based approach' to cultural heritage. Invoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right to access the manuscript. 'One of the things this project is focused on is on access — so, access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of Afghanistan,' Hepler said. To get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members of the Jewish community in New York. These efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in custodianship. The Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a letter of support for the project. Jack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the manuscript in the United States. 'I told [Hepler], ‘What you have in your hands is our heritage. It belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,’' Abraham said. But some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage. 'This is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to Afghanistan,' a senior former government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Barnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the book. 'The museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,' Rubin said. With a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims. A second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month. While the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community 'have a lot of agency in this custodianship.' To that end, the museum plans to provide one high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural institutions in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-the-oldest-known-hebrew-book-landed-in-a-washington-museum/7949998.html	2025-01-25T06:47:15-08:00	
China’s support for Myanmar regime backfires; scam syndicates thrive	WASHINGTON — Reports of Chinese citizens trafficked into scam centers along the Thai-Myanmar border are prompting renewed questions about Beijing’s reliance on Myanmar’s military regime to tackle transnational crime. Analysts warn China’s strategy in Myanmar leaves citizens vulnerable while potentially bolstering criminal networks in the conflict-ridden Southeast Asia country. Recent high-profile abduction cases have sparked outrage among the Chinese public, including the reported luring of Chinese actor Wang Xing to Myawaddy, a Thai-Myanmar border town, by scammers posing as film producers. Chinese embassies in Myanmar and Thailand have warned citizens about high-paying job offers that often lead to forced labor. Thai officials reported that actor Wang Xing was trafficked into a scam syndicate operating in areas controlled by an ally of Myanmar’s military, the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF. Speaking to local media, Brigadier General Saw Maung Win of the BGF Battalion 3 confirmed that the BGF had handed Chinese actor Wang Xing over to Thai authorities but denied involvement in the trafficking, claiming only to have assisted in the rescue operation. 'These incidents involving Chinese citizens trafficked to Myawaddy are handled cautiously by Chinese authorities,' said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-Myanmar analyst. 'But when action is required, China tends to pressure Thailand rather than directly addressing the situation in Myanmar.' Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace echoed similar concerns. 'China’s support for the Myanmar military comes at great cost to its own population,' Tower said, referencing a publicly available database with close to 2,000 names of people across China who have gone missing in Myanmar in recent years. Subsequently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Southeast Asian nations to take decisive action against online gambling and telecom fraud, emphasizing the need for 'relevant' countries to fulfill their responsibilities without explicitly naming Myanmar. At a meeting with ASEAN envoys on Jan. 16, he highlighted the growing threat these crimes pose, particularly along the Thai-Myanmar border, which has endangered citizens of China and other countries. Chinese and Thai police have jointly arrested 12 suspects connected to trafficking, with investigations ongoing and efforts underway to apprehend more suspects. On Friday, China's Ministry of Public Security said it was 'making every effort' to crack down on the scam compounds and 'rescue trafficked people.' China’s ‘carrot’ approach Tower said that China appears to favor a 'carrot' approach in its dealings with Myanmar’s military. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security awarded its highest honor, the Golden Great Wall Commemorative Medal, to Myanmar’s home affairs minister, Lieutenant General Yar Pyae, for joint efforts against transnational crime. However, analysts argue that despite China’s support, Myanmar’s military focuses on territorial battles rather than combating scam operations. According to Tower, Myanmar’s military lacks the capacity and the political will to address these syndicates effectively because the Myanmar military must rely on militia leader Saw Chit Thu to maintain control over Myawaddy, a crucial trade hub. Saw Chit Thu, the leader of the BGF, has been sanctioned by the United States, United Kingdom and European Union for his role in protecting Chinese gangs and scam operations. Scam networks reshuffle China’s aggressive crackdowns on scam networks along its northern border with Myanmar in recent years have pushed many scam operations to relocate to Myawaddy, Karen State, far from Beijing’s immediate oversight. Unlike northern Myanmar, where China has exerted direct pressure, Myawaddy’s geographical distance and political dynamics pose unique challenges to Beijing. Hla Kyaw Zaw said that China has seen some success in cracking down on online scams near its borders, but these efforts are largely localized. The measures have been less effective in other areas, such as Myawaddy, and scams continue to thrive. 'China closely monitors illegal activities in and around Myawaddy but depends on Thailand’s cooperation to address these issues,' Hla Kyaw Zaw said. In response to VOA's inquiries regarding scam operations, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar highlighted recent joint combat efforts by China and Myanmar against online scam operations. According to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar’s announcement on Tuesday, China will soon launch the second phase of its 'Jingyao Joint Law Enforcement Operation' initiative, a multinational effort with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam to combat telecom fraud and transnational crime, following a first phase that resulted in over 70,000 arrests regionally and the rescue of 160 victims, mainly from northern Myanmar along the China border. Social media uproar Chinese actor Wang’s abduction sparked outrage on Chinese social media platforms, along with a growing database of families whose relatives have disappeared under similar circumstances. A joint letter from the families of 174 people believed to be trapped in Myanmar went viral on China’s social media platform, Sina Weibo, on Jan. 9. A political and strategic dilemma As scam networks grow more sophisticated, analysts say Beijing faces a challenging balancing act between protecting its citizens and maintaining its strategic interests in Myanmar. Experts such as Tower are urging Beijing to reassess its priorities. 'China’s strategy is failing,' Tower argued. 'The reality is, as you can see, how easily Chinese [civilians] are still trafficked into the Myanmar military Border Guard Force territory,' he said. 'It’s not able to deal with these problems with the military.' However, balancing crackdowns without destabilizing the Myanmar regime presents a challenge. 'China seems to be losing on both fronts,' Tower said. 'This is a really tricky issue. On one hand, China doesn’t want the Myanmar military regime to collapse. And it recognizes that if it goes back to using that stick, it’s going to speed up the collapse of the Myanmar military.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-support-for-myanmar-regime-backfires-scam-syndicates-thrive/7950028.html	2025-01-25T06:04:38-08:00	
Moldovan president visits Kyiv to talk energy, security	KYIV, UKRAINE — Moldovan President Maia Sandu visited Kyiv on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid growing tensions in Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist enclave of Moldova that neighbors Ukraine. The territory, which has a population of half a million, has seen heating, hot water and electricity cut-offs since the start of the year because a Kyiv-Moscow gas transit contract that had allowed Russian gas to flow there has expired. 'We'll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade and mutual support on the EU path,' Sandu wrote on X as she arrived in the Ukrainian capital. There was a demonstration in Transnistria on Friday to call on Moldova to facilitate the transit of Russian gas and end the energy crisis, local media reported. Transnistria used to receive gas from Russia via a pipeline that crossed Ukraine and Moldova. Kyiv has refused to renew the transit contract, which expired on Jan. 1, abruptly ending Russian gas supplies to Transnistria, which has declared a state of emergency. The rest of Moldova has been spared gas cuts thanks to gas and electricity imports from neighboring Romania. With Ukraine's struggle against a Russian invasion nearly in its fourth year, Moldova is afraid the conflict could expand onto its territory in case of Russian attempts to destabilize Transnistria. In an interview with AFP, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean on Wednesday accused Moscow of trying to generate 'instability' in Moldova. He said the crisis could only be resolved if Russian troops stationed in Transnistria since a war against Moldova in 1992 are pulled out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-president-visits-kyiv-to-talk-energy-security/7949962.html	2025-01-25T03:30:55-08:00	
UN chief says 7 more workers detained by Houthi rebels in Yemen	SANAA, YEMEN — Yemen's Houthi rebels have detained another seven UN employees, the United Nations chief said on Friday, their latest move to target aid workers. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the 'immediate and unconditional' release of all aid staff held in Yemen, which is suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. 'Their continued arbitrary detention is unacceptable,' Guterres said in a statement, adding that the United Nations was working to secure the release of those being held. The Iran-backed Houthis have detained dozens of staff from U.N. and other humanitarian organizations, most of them since the middle of last year. Guterres said the 'continued targeting of UN personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen.' Reeling from a decade of war, Yemen is mired in a humanitarian catastrophe with more than 18 million people needing assistance and protection, according to the United Nations. Following the latest detentions, the United Nations has suspended 'all official movements into and within' areas held by Houthis, the office of the resident U.N. coordinator for Yemen said. The detentions come after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Houthis placed back on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Relisting the Houthis will trigger a review of U.N. agencies and other nongovernmental organizations working in Yemen that receive U.S. funding, according to the executive order signed on Wednesday. Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report, a U.S.-based risk advisor, called the latest detentions 'an expected reaction' to the 'terrorist' designation. 'They assume that by detaining U.N. staff they're going to be able to pressure the international community to pressure the Trump administration,' he said. No immediate comment was available from the Houthis, who seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and rule large parts of the impoverished country. The rebels, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, have been attacking the Red Sea shipping route and firing on Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza war, prompting reprisal strikes from U.S., Israeli and British forces. With a Gaza ceasefire starting last Sunday, the Houthis have made conciliatory moves, including releasing the 25-strong international crew of the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship they seized in the Red Sea in November 2023. The rebels have also promised to tone down the Red Sea attacks and have said they would stop targeting Israel if it sticks to the ceasefire. The Houthis have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, although hostilities have fallen sharply since a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in 2022. Since the start of the war, the Houthis have kidnapped, arbitrarily detained and tortured hundreds of civilians, including U.N. and NGO workers, according to rights groups. In June, the rebels detained 13 U.N. personnel, including six employees of the Human Rights Office, and more than 50 NGO staff plus an embassy staff member. They claimed they had arrested 'an American-Israeli spy network' operating under the cover of humanitarian organizations — allegations emphatically rejected by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Two other U.N. human rights staff had already been detained since November 2021 and August 2023, respectively. In early August, the Houthis stormed the UNHCR office, forced staff to hand over the keys, and seized documents and property, before returning it later that month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-says-7-more-workers-detained-by-houthi-rebels-in-yemen/7949954.html	2025-01-25T03:05:38-08:00	
Drone attack on hospital in Sudan's Darfur kills 30, source says	PORT SUDAN, SUDAN — A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region killed 30 people and injured dozens, a medical source said Saturday. The bombing of the Saudi Hospital on Friday evening 'led to the destruction' of the hospital's building where emergency cases were treated, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation. It was not immediately clear which of Sudan's warring sides had launched the attack. Since April 2023, the Sudanese army has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who have seized nearly the entire vast western region of Darfur. They have besieged El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, since May, but have not managed to claim the city, where army-aligned militias have repeatedly pushed them back. According to the medical source, the same building had been hit by an RSF drone 'a few weeks ago.' Attacks on health care have been rampant in El-Fasher, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this month the Saudi Hospital was 'the only public hospital with surgical capacity still standing.' Across the country, up to 80% of health care facilities have been forced out of service, according to official figures. The war has so far killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and brought millions to the brink of mass starvation. In the area around El-Fasher, famine has already taken hold in three displacement camps -- Zamzam, Abu Shouk and Al-Salam -- and is expected to expand to five more areas including the city itself by May, according to a U.N.-backed assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-attack-on-hospital-in-sudan-s-darfur-kills-30-source-says/7949955.html	2025-01-25T03:01:39-08:00	
Hamas set to release hostages in next exchange for prisoners held by Israel	Hamas was set Saturday to release four Israeli women held as hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said Friday. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the cease-fire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-set-to-release-hostages-in-next-exchange-for-prisoners-held-by-israel/7949930.html	2025-01-25T01:18:24-08:00	
Buoyed by Trump's promises, Uzbeks seek closer ties to US	TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN/WASHINGTON — Uzbekistan is expected to push to deepen relations with the United States in the coming year, a position that is broadly popular among Uzbeks across the country, VOA found during a recent reporting trip. With more than 37 million people, Uzbekistan, Washington's strategic partner in Central Asia, accounts for more than half of the population of the region, which includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. 'I understand that the U.S. prefers dealing with us in the C5+1 format — five republics plus Uncle Sam — but we want more bilateral attention, at least for now,' said Sherbek Artikov, a young Uzbek hoping to study political science in America. Artikov is aware that many of his fellow Uzbeks are often denied U.S. visas and that hundreds of them have been deported since 2019 as undocumented immigrants. Yet, he remains optimistic: 'I believe over time, Washington will see that Uzbeks are not only reliable strategic partners but also hardworking, compassionate people — both as migrants and visitors.' In recent conversations with a VOA reporter traveling across Tashkent, Ferghana, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Surkhandarya, most Uzbeks expressed enthusiasm about U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They hoped his administration would foster stronger connections with the people of Uzbekistan, not just its government. From journalists and activists to entrepreneurs and educators, they want Trump to fulfill his promises to end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'We are a peaceful region, despite the continuous turmoil in neighboring Afghanistan, but these conflicts deeply trouble us,' said Zuhra Amonova, an English teacher in Bukhara. Calls for new approach As relations between Washington and Central Asian nations have evolved, there have been some calls by American experts for creating a new diplomatic approach, shifting the U.S. government away from grouping the countries with South Asian nations and instead aligning them more with the Caucasus. Veteran bureaucrats who have worked with these regions at the State Department and the Pentagon told VOA that Washington's view of this part of the world has increasingly been seen through a Russian lens since the U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Ikboljon Qoraboyev, a professor at Maqsut Narikbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan, says the Central Asia-Caucasus proposal reflects the region's crucial role between China and Russia and the growing significance of the Middle Corridor, a transit route across the Caspian Sea that carries goods westward to European markets. 'Central Asian policymakers may welcome the change, as their previous alignment with South Asia felt misaligned with their identity,' Qoraboyev told VOA. 'But U.S. policymakers must recognize each country's distinct interests, rather than relying solely on regional frameworks.' Like many experts VOA spoke to, he points out that Central Asian governments are eager for closer ties with the U.S., seeking investment, political support, development aid, and expanded educational and technological exchanges. These are among the key factors in the policy recommendations by Eric Rudenshiold, a former White House, Congress, and USAID official, now a senior fellow at the Caspian Policy Center. 'Successful U.S. engagement in the Trans-Caspian region will preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Caucasus and Central Asia,' Rudenshiold said at a forum in Washington ahead of the inauguration. He emphasized that such an approach would benefit the U.S. while creating opportunities in energy development, trade, and connectivity. Rudenshiold believes that promoting American values in this way could spur economic and political reforms in the region and shape democratic institutions. 'The Trans-Caspian region is becoming a vital geopolitical and economic crossroads, important to U.S. interests as it counters Russia's restrictions on the region's gas, oil, and uranium supplies and China's efforts to control next-generation energy,' he wrote in a strategic brief. Washington needs security agreements and closer partnerships in the region, Rudenshiold argued, 'due to shared concerns over renewed terrorist threats and its geostrategic location bordering Russia, China, Afghanistan, and Iran.' Leaders encourage Trump visit In congratulatory messages to Trump, regional leaders have invited him to visit. No U.S. president has ever toured Central Asia and the Caucasus. In a letter to Trump, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote that his country 'deeply values and appreciates the U.S. policy of consistently supporting the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of our nation.' He credited Trump's first term for renewing the strategic partnership, adding: 'We are committed to further developing our long-term cooperation within bilateral and multilateral frameworks.' The Trump administration has yet to outline its priorities both in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Rudenshiold and his center are pressing to appoint a special representative for these regions. Javlon Vakhabov, Uzbekistan's former ambassador to the U.S. and Canada who now heads the International Institute for Central Asia in Tashkent, also advocates for deeper political dialogue. 'In an era of global uncertainty, Central Asia seeks to collectively champion its interests on the international stage and coordinate efforts to address shared challenges,' Vakhabov told VOA. 'A high-level U.S. visit to Uzbekistan would underscore the region's importance.' Vakhabov sees great potential in the Middle Corridor, where secondary routes via Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan could strengthen supply chains and diversify transportation lines. He highlights the Uzbekistan–Afghanistan—Pakistan railway, 'which will reduce delivery times from 35 days to just three and cut shipping costs by two-thirds.' Vakhabov agrees with Rudenshiold that U.S. support for such initiatives would enhance regional stability and attract more American businesses. Touting Uzbekistan's natural resources, he underlines that collaboration on essential minerals and rare earth elements could help the U.S. strengthen 'defense, manufacturing, and technological competitiveness.' Some yearn to learn The U.S. has a long history of cooperation with Central Asian countries on counterterrorism and border security. Vakhabov recommends expanding that cooperation 'since they serve common interests.' The Human Rights Watch 2025 annual report describes Central Asia as a region where autocratic regimes systematically violate freedoms, reforms are stalled or superficial, and security forces hold significant power, undermining the rule of law. Uzbeks interviewed by VOA this winter expressed mixed views on the U.S. role in promoting justice and freedom, but most admired its democratic system. 'We need to grasp how democracy works in practice,' said Dilrabo Zaripova, a small business owner in Samarkand. 'From what we saw in this U.S. presidential election, it requires a strong will and commitment. I don't think we're there yet. But having close ties with America would help us learn from its resilience and complex experience.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/excited-about-trump-s-promises-uzbeks-hopeful-for-closer-engagement/7949771.html	2025-01-24T23:23:21-08:00	
One of last Auschwitz survivors makes telling the stories his mission	HAIFA, ISRAEL — Naftali Furst will never forget his first view of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, on Nov. 3, 1944. He was 12 years old. SS soldiers threw open the doors of the cattle car, where he was crammed in with his mother, father, brother, and more than 80 others. He remembers the tall chimneys of the crematoria, flames roaring from the top. There were dogs and officers yelling in German 'Get out, get out!' forcing people to jump onto the infamous ramp where Nazi doctor Josef Mengele separated children from parents. Furst, now 92, is one of a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors able to share first-person accounts of the horrors they endured, as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazis' most notorious death camp. Furst is returning to Auschwitz for the annual occasion, his fourth trip to the camp. Each time he returns, he thinks of those first moments there. 'We knew we were going to certain death,' he said from his home in Haifa, northern Israel, earlier this month. 'In Slovakia, we knew that people who went to Poland didn't return.' Strokes of luck Furst and his family arrived at the entrance to Auschwitz on Nov. 3, 1944 -– one day after Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler ordered the cessation of the use of the gas chambers ahead of their demolition, as the Soviet troops neared. The order meant that his family wasn't immediately killed. It was one of many small bits of luck and coincidences that allowed Furst to survive. 'For 60 years, I didn't talk about the Holocaust, for 60 years I didn't speak a word of German even though it's my mother tongue,' said Furst. In 2005, he was invited to attend the ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald, where he was liberated on April 11, 1945, after being moved there from Auschwitz. He realized there were fewer and fewer Holocaust survivors who could give first-person accounts, and he decided to throw himself into memorial work. This will be his fourth trip to a ceremony at Auschwitz, having also met Pope Francis there in 2016. Some 6 million European Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust — the mass murder of Jews and other groups before and during World War II. Soviet Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau on Jan. 27, 1945, and the day has become known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. An estimated 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Just 220,000 Holocaust survivors are still alive, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and more than 20% are over 90. A meeting place after the war Furst, originally from Bratislava, then part of Czechoslovakia, was just 6 when the Nazis first started implementing measures against the country's Jews. He spent ages 9 to 12 in four different concentration camps, including Auschwitz. His parents had planned to jump off of the cattle car on the way to the camp, but people were packed so tightly they couldn't reach the doors. His father instructed the entire family, no matter what, to meet at 11 Sulekova St. in Bratislava after the war. Furst and his brother were separated from their mother. After numbers were tattooed on their arms, they also were taken from their father. They lived in Block 29, without many other children. As the Soviet army closed in on the area, so close they could hear the booms from the tanks, Furst and his brother, Shmuel, were forced to join a dangerous journey toward Buchenwald, marching for three days in the cold and snow. Anyone who lagged behind was shot. 'We had to prove our desire to live, to do another step and another step and keep going,' he said. Many people gave up, longing to end the hunger and thirst and cold, and just sat down, where they were shot by the guards. 'We had this command from my father: 'You must adapt and survive, and even if you're suffering, you must come back,'' Furst recalled. Furst and his brother survived the march, and an open-car train ride in the snow, but they were separated at the next camp. When Furst was liberated from Buchenwald, captured in a famous photo that included Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in the bunkbeds, he was sure he was alone in the world. But within months, just as Furst's father had instructed, the four family members reunited at the address they memorized, the home of family friends. The rest of their family –- grandparents, aunts, uncles — were all killed. His family later moved to Israel, where he married, had a daughter, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, with another on the way. 'We couldn't imagine this tragedy' On Oct. 7, 2023, Furst awoke to the Hamas attack on southern Israel, and immediately thought of his granddaughter, Mika Peleg, and her husband, and their 2-year-old son, who live in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza where scores of people were killed or kidnapped. 'It just kept getting worse all day, we couldn't get any information what was happening with them,' said Furst. 'We saw the horrors, that we couldn't imagine this type of horror is happening in 2023, 80 years after the Holocaust.' Toward midnight on Oct. 7, Peleg's neighbors sent word that the family had survived. They spent almost 20 hours locked inside their safe room with no food or ability to communicate. Her husband's parents, who both lived on Kfar Aza, were killed. Despite his close connection, comparisons between Oct. 7 and the Holocaust make Furst uncomfortable. 'It's awful and terrible and a catastrophe, and hard to describe, but it's not a Holocaust,' he said. As awful as the Hamas attack was for his granddaughter and others, the Holocaust was a multi-year 'death industry' with massive infrastructure and camps that could kill 10,000 people a day for months at a time, he said. Furst, who was previously involved in coexistence work between Jews and Arabs, said his heart also goes out to Palestinians in Gaza, although he believes Israel needed to respond militarily. 'I feel the pain of everyone who is suffering, everywhere in the world, because I think I know what suffering is,' he said. Furst knows that he is one of very few Holocaust survivors still able to travel to Auschwitz, so it's important for him to be present there to mark the 80th anniversary. These days, he is telling his story as many times as he can, taking part in documentaries and movies, serving as the president of the Buchenwald Prisoner's Association and working to create a memorial statue at the Sered' concentration camp in Slovakia. He feels a responsibility to be the mouthpiece for the millions who were killed, and people can relate to the story of a single person more than the hard numbers of 6 million deaths, he said. 'Whenever I finish, I tell the youth, the fact that you were able to see living testimony (from a Holocaust survivor) puts a requirement on you more than someone who did not: you take it on your shoulders the obligation to continue to tell this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-last-auschwitz-survivors-makes-telling-the-stories-his-mission/7949857.html	2025-01-24T23:21:32-08:00	
US pressure mounts on Thailand over 48 Uyghur detainees as hunger strike continues	WASHINGTON — The plight of 48 Uyghur detainees in Thailand has drawn international scrutiny as the group’s hunger strike protesting their possible return to China stretches into day 15 with the U.S. State Department, U.N. officials and activists voicing concern. 'By international human rights standards, such a prolonged hunger strike requires authorities to address grievances and ensure the detainees’ well-being,' said Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs and chairperson of the World Uyghur Congress executive committee. The group of Uyghurs has been held in Bangkok’s Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) since 2014, fleeing alleged persecution in China’s Xinjiang region. After more than a decade of detention there, their future remains precarious amid mounting calls for Thailand to uphold its human rights commitments. US and Thai response A U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA late Thursday that Washington is 'following this situation closely' and 'deeply concerned by the reports.' The spokesperson told VOA that the United States is engaging with the Royal Thai Government on the matter. 'We continue to urge the Royal Thai Government to respect the principle of non-refoulement and to uphold its respective non-refoulment obligations under international law,' the spokesperson said. 'As Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio indicated during his confirmation hearing, he is prepared to use diplomacy and leverage the longstanding U.S.-Thailand alliance to engage the Royal Thai Government on the reported imminent repatriation of Uyghur detainees to China.' At a press conference on Friday, Thailand’s Foreign Ministry said 'no decision has been made' regarding the Uyghur detainees. 'Any decision on this matter will be based on relevant domestic legal frameworks, human rights principles, especially the principle of non-refoulement, including Thailand’s obligation to refrain from returning people to where they will face torture or enforced disappearance,' said Nikorndej Balankura, the ministry’s director general of information. 'For the time being no decision has been made. I can assure their safety.' Advocates sound alarm Despite assurances from Thai officials, human rights advocates remain skeptical, warning of the severe consequences if the Uyghur detainees are repatriated to China. The 48 men, arrested in 2014 alongside over 300 other Uyghurs attempting to cross into Malaysia via human trafficking routes from China’s Yunnan province, have been detained in Thailand for more than a decade. In 2015, 109 of the Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China, sparking international outrage, with their fates still unknown. Meanwhile, 173 women and children were resettled in Turkey, and five detainees, including two children, have died since 2014. Abbas expressed alarm over the uncertain future of the Uyghur detainees, drawing a parallel to the 'devastating precedent' set in 2015. 'These 48 men could face the same dark fate as those deported nearly a decade ago. The Thai government must not repeat the mistakes of 2015,' Abbas said. 'At that time, despite making similar assurances as today’s, Thai authorities sent 109 Uyghur men to China. They likely disappeared into the black hole of a regime infamous for torture and genocide.' Abbas also cited concerns that the deportations could occur imminently, possibly before the Thai prime minister’s scheduled visit to China on Feb. 4. 'It seems they are trying to gain leverage from China by acting before the visit,' she told VOA in a phone interview. The stakes in 2025, Abbas emphasized, are even higher than in 2015. 'If Thailand chooses to deport these Uyghurs despite the U.S. genocide determination and the U.N. finding of crimes against humanity, it would be a grave violation of international law and an affront to the principles of human rights,' she said. 'Thailand should prepare for a tsunami of condemnation and face severe economic and political consequences.' In 2021, the U.S. formally designated China’s treatment of the Uyghurs as genocide, and in a 2022 report, the U.N. human rights office stated that China’s actions in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity, including torture, forced labor, and forced sterilization. China’s response China has repeatedly denied the U.N. and U.S. determinations of genocide, asserting that its actions in Xinjiang are aimed at combating separatism, extremism and terrorism – what Beijing refers to as the 'three evils.' The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok weighed in last Wednesday, alleging the Uyghur detainees had terrorist affiliations. 'A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled abroad and even joined the 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement' [ETIM], a terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming terrorists themselves,' the embassy stated on its website. However, the narrative surrounding ETIM has evolved. While the group was designated a terrorist organization by the U.N. in 2002, the U.S. delisted it in 2020. A report by the Congressional Research Service at the time cited a lack of 'clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence.' Health deterioration According to U.N. experts, the detainees’ health is rapidly deteriorating. In a statement earlier this week, they said 23 of the 48 suffer from serious health conditions including diabetes, kidney disfunction, lower body paralysis, skin diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses, and heart and lung conditions. 'It is essential they be provided with the necessary and appropriate medical care,' the report said. U.S. Representative Gregory Meeks, ranking member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday condemning any potential deportation. 'If these Uyghurs are deported back to the PRC, Thailand would be violating the customary practice of nonrefoulement and its commitments as State Party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,' he said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Meeks called on the Thai government to guarantee the detainees' protection, provide them with access to asylum procedures, and ensure they receive the medical care they need.

App provides immediate fire information to Los Angeles residents	OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — From his home in northern California, Nick Russell, a former farm manager, is monitoring the Los Angeles-area fires. He knows that about 600 kilometers south, people in Los Angeles are relying on his team’s live neighborhood-by-neighborhood updates on fire outbreaks, smoke direction, surface wind predictions and evacuation routes. Russell is vice president of operations at Watch Duty, a free app that tracks fires and other natural disasters. It relies on a variety of data sources such as cameras and sensors throughout the state, government agencies, first responders, a core of volunteers, and its own team of reporters. An emergency at his house, for example, would be 'much different' from one at his neighbor's house .4 kilometers away, Russell said. 'That is true for communities everywhere, and that’s where technology really comes in.' Watch Duty's delivery of detailed localized information is one reason for its success with its 7 million users, many of whom downloaded the app in recent weeks. It acts as a virtual emergency operations center, culling and verifying data points. Watch Duty’s success points to the promise that technologies such as artificial intelligence and sensors will give residents and first responders the real-time information they need to survive and fight natural disasters. Google and other firms have invested in technology to track fires. Several startup firms are also looking for ways to use AI, sensors and other technologies in natural disasters. Utility firms work with Gridware, a company that places AI-enhanced sensors on power lines to detect a tree branch touching the line or any other vibrations that could indicate a problem. Among Watch Duty’s technology partners is ALERTCalifornia, run by the University of San Diego, which has a network of more than 1,000 AI-enhanced cameras throughout the state looking for smoke. The cameras often detect fires before people call emergency lines, Russell said. Together with ALERTCalifornia’s information, Russell said, 'we have become the eyes and ears' of fires. Another Watch Duty partner is N-5 Sensors, a Maryland-based firm. Its sensors, which are placed in the ground, detect smoke, heat and other signs of fire. 'They're like a nose, if you will, so they detect smoke anomalies and different chemical patterns in the air,' Russell said. Watch Duty is available in 22 states, mostly in the western U.S., and plans to expand to all states. While fire has been its focus, Watch Duty also plans to track other natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, Russell said. 'Fire is not in the name,' he said. 'We want to be that one-stop shop where people can go in those times of duress, to have a source that makes it clear and concise what’s happening.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/app-provides-immediate-fire-information-to-los-angeles-residents/7949884.html	2025-01-24T20:34:28-08:00	
Trump says US government is behind California during visit to fire-stricken state	U.S. President Donald Trump said the federal government is standing behind California 100% in the aftermath of devastating wildfires and said during a visit to the state on Friday that he would come back as much as needed. 'The first lady and I are in California to express a great love for the people of California,' Trump told a gathering of local leaders at a fire station in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The neighborhood was one of the worst hit by the recent fires, with rows of homes left in ashes. Trump participated in a walking tour of the area earlier in the day and also surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. 'I don’t think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating it is, until you see it,' Trump said after the tour. The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to California that he would 'take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.' California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president’s assertion, and other state legislators have said the fierce wildfires placed extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes. Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands. 'I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work together,' Newsom said. Trump responded: 'We’re going to get it fixed.' During the gathering with community leaders, Trump said that Los Angeles residents who lost homes should be allowed back onto their properties immediately, challenging Mayor Karen Bass to speed up the cleanup process. 'People are willing to get a dumpster and do it themselves and clean it up. There is not that much left, it is all incinerated,' Trump said. Bass said, 'the most important thing is for people to be safe,' but promised residents should be able to return home within the week. Trump promised that federal permits to rebuild would be granted promptly and urged local officials to do the same. Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA 'has been a very big disappointment' and said he is considering 'getting rid' of the agency. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow,' Trump said of the agency. Trump continued to express dissatisfaction with FEMA while in California, calling it a 'big disappointment.' Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its water policies. 'Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,' Representative Young Kim, a Republican from Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual states to respond to disasters. 'I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,' he said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. 'FEMA is getting in the way of everything.' Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump has been 'misinformed' about the agency, and he took exception to what he characterized as Trump’s inclination to play politics with disaster relief. Ahead of Trump’s visit to southern California, firefighters continued to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region. The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95% contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for surrounding areas. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County’s health officer, said in a statement. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to the Cal Fire. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and dry conditions continued to cause 'elevated' fire weather conditions on Friday. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. The fires that broke out in southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-us-government-is-behind-california-during-visit-to-fire-stricken-state/7949879.html	2025-01-24T19:57:49-08:00	
Russian deepfake videos target Ukrainian refugees, including teen	New online videos recently investigated by VOA's Russian and Ukrainian services show how artificial intelligence is likely being used to try to create provocative deepfakes that target Ukrainian refugees. In one example, a video appears to be a TV news report about a teenage Ukrainian refugee and her experience studying at a private school in the United States. But the video then flips to footage of crowded school corridors and packets of crack cocaine, while a voiceover that sounds like the girl calls American public schools dangerous and invokes offensive stereotypes about African Americans. 'I realize it's quite expensive [at private school],' she says. 'But it wouldn't be fair if my family was made to pay for my safety. Let Americans do it.' Those statements are total fabrications. Only the first section — footage of the teenager — is real. The offensive voiceover was likely created using artificial intelligence (AI) to realistically copy her voice, resulting in something known as a deepfake. And it appears to be part of the online Russian information operation called Matryoshka —‚ named for the Russian nesting doll — that is now targeting Ukrainian refugees. VOA found that the campaign pushed two deepfake videos that aimed to make Ukrainian refugees look greedy and ungrateful, while also spreading deepfakes that appeared to show authoritative Western journalists claiming that Ukraine — and not Russia — was the country spreading falsehoods. The videos reflect the most recent strategy among Russia's online disinformation campaign, according to Antibot4Navalny, an X account that researches Russian information operations and has been widely cited by leading Western news outlets. Russia's willingness to target refugees, including a teenager, shows just how far the Kremlin, which regularly denies having a role in disinformation, is prepared to go in attempting to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Targeting the victims A second video targeting Ukrainian refugees begins with real footage from a news report in which a Ukrainian woman expresses gratitude for clothing donations and support that Denmark has provided to refugees. The video then switches to generic footage and a probable deepfake as the woman's voice begins to complain that Ukrainian refugees are forced to live in small apartments and wear used clothing. VOA is not sharing either video to protect the identities of the refugees depicted in the deepfakes, but both used stolen footage from reputable international media outlets. That technique — altering the individual's statements while replicating their voice — is new for Matryoshka, Antibot4Navalny told VOA. 'In the last few weeks, almost all the clips have been built according to this scheme,' the research group wrote. But experts say the underlying strategy of spoofing real media reports and targeting refugees is nothing new. After Russia's deadly April 2022 missile strike on Ukraine's Kramatorsk railway station, for example, the Kremlin created a phony BBC news report blaming Ukrainians for the strike, according to Roman Osadchuk, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. During that same period, he noted, Russia also spread disinformation in Moldova aimed at turning the local population against Ukrainian refugees. 'Unfortunately, refugees are a very popular target for Russian disinformation campaigns, not only for attacks on the host community ... but also in Ukraine,' Osadchuk told VOA. When such disinformation operations are geared toward a Ukrainian audience, he added, the goal is often to create a clash between those who left Ukraine and those who stayed behind. Deepfakes of journalists, however, appear designed to influence public opinion in a different way. One video that purports to contain audio of Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, for example, claims that Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is just a bluff. 'The whole world is watching Ukraine's death spasms,' Higgins appears to say. 'There's nothing further to discuss.' In another video, Shayan Sardarizadeh, a senior journalist at BBC Verify, appears to say that 'Ukraine creates fakes so that fact-checking organizations blame Russia,' something he then describes as part of a 'global hoax.' In fact, both videos appear to be deepfakes created according to the same formula as the ones targeting refugees. Higgins tells VOA that the entirety of the audio impersonation of his own voice appears to be a deepfake. He suggests the goal of the video was to engage factcheckers and get them to accidentally boost its viewership. 'I think it's more about boosting their stats so [the disinformation actors] can keep milking the Russian state for money to keep doing it,' he told VOA by email. Sardarizadeh did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. Fake video, real harm The rapid expansion of AI over the past few years has drawn increased attention to the problem of deepfake videos and AI images, particularly when these technologies are used to create non-consensual, sexually explicit imagery. Researchers have estimated that over 90% of deepfakes online are sexually explicit. They have been used both against ordinary women and girls and celebrities. Deepfakes also have been used to target politicians and candidates for public office. It remains unclear, however, whether they have actually influenced public opinion or election outcomes. Researchers from Microsoft's Theat Analysis Center have found that 'fully synthetic' videos of world leaders are often not convincing and are easily debunked. But they also concluded that deepfake audio is often more effective. The four videos pushed by Matryoshka — which primarily uses deepfake audio — show that the danger of deepfakes isn't restricted to explicit images or impersonations of politicians. And if your image is available online, there isn't much you can do to fully protect yourself. Today, there's always a risk in 'sharing any information publicly, including your voice, appearance, or pictures,' Osadchuk said. The damage to individuals can be serious. Belle Torek, an attorney who specializes in tech policy and civil rights, said that people whose likenesses are used without consent often experience feelings of violation, humiliation, helplessness and fear. 'They tend to report feeling that their trust has been violated. Knowing that their image is being manipulated to spread lies or hate can exacerbate existing trauma,' she said. 'And in this case here, I think that those effects are going to be amplified for these [refugee] communities, who are already enduring displacement and violence.' How effective are deepfakes? While it is not difficult to understand the potential harm of deepfakes, it is more challenging to assess their broader reach and impact. An X post featur phony videos of refugees received over 55,000 views. That represents significant spread, according to Olga Tokariuk, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. 'It is not yet viral content, but it is no longer marginal content,' she said. Antibot4Navalny, on the other hand, believes that Russian disinformation actors are largely amplifying the X posts using other controlled accounts and very few real people are seeing them. But even if large numbers of real people did view the deepfakes, that doesn't necessarily mean the videos achieved the Kremlin's goals. 'It is always difficult ... to prove with 100% correlation the impact of these disinformation campaigns on politics,' Tokariuk said.

US Senate approves Hegseth as defense secretary by 51-50 vote	The U.S. Senate has approved Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as defense secretary, on a mostly party-line 51-50 vote. Vice President J.D. Vance broke the 50-50 tie in the 100-member Senate, casting the deciding vote. It is only the second time in U.S. history that a vice president, who is president of the Senate, would have to break a tie for a nominee. The vote late Friday followed days of Senate debate over Hegseth’s fitness for the top civilian role in the U.S. military, managing the nation’s armed forces. In his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Hegseth told lawmakers he would bring back accountability to the nation’s military. He received support from Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Senator Roger Wicker, who said, 'Pete Hegseth has the determination and the tools to achieve real change. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.' But Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he led. Earlier this week, senators received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth, Hegseth's former sister-in-law, alleging he was abusive towards his second ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth. She did not describe the abuse and said she did not witness it. In a statement to NBC News, which first reported the story, Samantha Hegseth said, 'There was no physical abuse in my marriage.' Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Thursday he was not satisfied with Hegseth’s answers to his questions about reports that the Trump administration would implement a board to screen senior military officers for their fitness to lead. 'We've seen it happen in other places around the world, where militaries are undermined and subjected by political leaders that have a particular political point of view and passion, and they become essentially not an army but an extension of the political aspirations of the Great Leader. We can't see that here in America,' Reed said. Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News Channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books. 'I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years,' Hegseth told senators in his opening statement, 'But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with the supposed right of credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it gotten us?' Republican senators praised Hegseth for his fresh perspective. 'Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the military's core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must fight,' Wicker said during the confirmation hearings. Hegseth said his priorities if confirmed as secretary of defense would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the homeland, while reorienting the U.S. away from entanglements in the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based military. Asked how he sees his potential role, Hegseth replied, 'Getting anything that doesn't contribute to our democracy out of how decisions are made inside the Pentagon. What gender you are. What race you are. Your views on climate change. Your conscience and your faith should have no bearing on whether you get promoted or whether you're selected to go to West Point or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is, ‘How capable are you at your job? How excellent are you at your job?’' Hegseth is the first secretary of defense to have served as a junior officer on the front lines, and the first secretary from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars. Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits benefiting military veterans, with fewer than 100 employees, was not sufficient experience to run the massive U.S. Department of Defense. 'We're hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest organizations in the world. We're the board of directors here. I don't know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that said, you know, ‘I supervised 100 people before,’' Democratic Senator Gary Peters. The Defense Department oversees more than 3 million service members and a budget of $857 billion. Hegseth also faced allegations of sexual assault and public drunkenness during his time at Fox News. Reed said the FBI background investigation into Hegseth was insufficient. 'You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the positions of defense,' Reed said, noting he has voted for all nine previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during Trump’s first term. All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics review. Hegseth faced allegations of financial mismanagement of the two nonprofits where he served as executive director — Vets for Freedom, and Concerned Vets for America. After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth admitted the organization was half a million dollars in debt, and he was demoted. During his time at Concerned Vets for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement. Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources. 'We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And that it wasn't about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who's had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time, and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,' Hegseth said during his confirmation. Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in the U.S. military. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done 'a very big about-face in a short period of time' due to Trump’s nomination of him as secretary of defense. Warren said last week, 'For 12 years, you were quite open about your views — and your views were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen and Guardians. Then on November 9, 2024, just 32 days after your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, you declare that ‘Some of our greatest warriors are women.’' Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support of Hegseth’s nomination. Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles during his tenure as secretary of defense. 'Given the standards remain high, and we'll have a review to ensure standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-approves-hegseth-as-defense-secretary-by-51-50-vote/7949878.html	2025-01-24T19:30:42-08:00	
Driver rams anti-government rally in Serbia's capital, hurts protester	BELGRADE, SERBIA — A woman rammed a car into a crowd of anti-government protesters in Serbia's capital and injured one of them Friday, police said, as a student-led strike shut down businesses and drew tens of thousands of people to demonstrations around the country. The nationwide protests took place on the same day that President Aleksandar Vucic held a big afternoon rally with thousands of supporters in the central town of Jagodina, his coalition stronghold, to counter the persistent anti-government protests that have challenged his tight grip on power for nearly three months. Vucic told his supporters that the country has been 'attacked both from outside and inside' by the anti-government protests. 'It is not accidental that that they have attacked Serbia from abroad,' Vucic said, pointing out Serbia's friendly relations with Russia and China, and a refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow because of the war in Ukraine. 'That is what they want to crush, but we must not allow it. That is our strength,' he told the cheering crowd. Call for talks Vucic also called for a dialogue with the striking students, who have received widespread support from all walks of life in Serbia, at the same time weakening popular support for his party. The students have rejected negotiations on their demands with Vucic. The protesters have blocked traffic daily in Serbia to protest the deaths of 15 people killed in the November collapse of a train station canopy that critics have blamed on government corruption. The government denies blame for the deaths. Police in Belgrade said that they detained the 24-year-old driver who rammed into a crowd of protesters in a section of the city called New Belgrade. The injured victim, a 26-year-old woman, was hospitalized; her condition was described as stable. A similar incident took place during a blockade last week in Belgrade, when a car rammed into protesting students, seriously injuring a young woman. Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. Weekslong protests demanding accountability for the crash have been the biggest since Vucic came to power more than a decade ago. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. It wasn't immediately possible to determine how many people and companies joined the students' call for a one-day general strike on Friday. They included restaurants, bars, theaters, bakeries, shops and bookstores. 'Let's take freedom in our hands,' students told the citizens in their strike call. At his rally in Jagodina, Vucic announced the formation in March of a nationwide political movement in the style of Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia movement to help ensure the dominance of his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party. 'You are all welcome to the movement of big change and future,' Vucic said. He said that the movement will include people who aren't members of any political party. 'We need new energy,' Vucic said. Foreign influence alleged The president and the country's mainstream media have accused the students of working under orders from foreign intelligence services to overthrow the authorities while pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked protesting citizens. The 15-minute traffic blockades on Friday started at 11:52 a.m., the exact time of the canopy collapse in Novi Sad. Serbian universities have been blockaded for two months, along with many schools. A lawyers association also has gone on strike, but it remained unclear how many people stayed away from work in the state-run institutions on Friday. Protest marches were held Friday in Belgrade, Novi Sad, the southern city of Nis and other smaller cities — even in Jagodina before Vucic's arrival. 'Things can't stay the same anymore,' actor Goran Susljik told N1 regional television. 'Students have offered us the possibility of change.' Serbia's prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people for the canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister, Goran Vesic, has been released from detention, fueling doubts about the investigation's independence. The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-rams-anti-government-rally-in-serbia-s-capital-hurts-protester-/7949871.html	2025-01-24T19:14:24-08:00	
Trump visits fire-stricken California, vows 'to get it fixed'	U.S. President Donald Trump toured parts of California damaged by wildfire as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. Trump surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter on Friday, including flying over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood where a fire left rows of homes in ashes.

Afghan refugees in Pakistan worry as US suspends resettlement program	WASHINGTON — The Sultani family was nearing the final stages of their case to resettle in the U.S., though their plan was disrupted after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 suspending the relocation of refugees to the U.S. 'My family and I couldn’t sleep at night' since the executive order was signed, said 50-year-old Ahmad Zahir Sultani, who fled to Pakistan alongside his wife and four children a few months after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. 'We are very worried ... as we face an uncertain future,' said Sultani, who worked with U.S.-run projects in Afghanistan before the U.S. pulled out of the country in 2021. Just hours after his swearing-in as the 47th President of the U.S., Trump signed the executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program beginning Jan. 27. The Sultani family was identified as a Priority 1 case for resettlement under that program. 'This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the United States,' stated the order. The order calls on the secretary of the Homeland Security Department, in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president within 90 days if the program 'would be in the interests of the United States.' The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to the president until he 'determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.' Sultani and other Afghan refugees who have been waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the U.S. told VOA that staying in Pakistan would be 'very difficult' for them as the crackdown on Afghan refugees continues in Islamabad, where the Sultanis currently reside. 'We are facing harassment and arrests by the police [in Pakistan]. And we can’t go back to Afghanistan as we fled because of the threats there,' Sultani said. According to Pakistan’s Foreign Office in July, among more than 44,000 Afghans living in Pakistan to be relocated to third countries, about 25,000 Afghan refugees are waiting to be resettled in the U.S. Fahimi Zahid, an Afghan activist living in Islamabad, told VOA that after the suspension of their relocation program to the U.S., Afghan refugees in Pakistan are 'very concerned' about their future in Pakistan. 'In the past, refugees had a hope that the U.S. was in talks with Pakistan to ensure they wouldn’t face any harassment,' she said, 'but after the executive order, it is for sure that Afghans would face further harassment and deportation.' According to the U.S. State Department, more than 180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024. Thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan are still waiting to be relocated to the U.S. Shawn VanDiver, the president of AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping the U.S., told VOA that until the USRAP resumes, 'there won’t be any travel. Refugees won’t be flying here or anywhere else.' U.S. media reported Wednesday that the flights of Afghan refugees who were supposed to be relocated to the U.S. were canceled only days before the order would go into effect. VanDiver said the order mainly would affect Afghan refugees with Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases. He said he and others at AfghanEvec are trying to have President Trump issue 'an exemption for Afghans.' 'People that pass security and waiting medical and all that, we got to make sure they get here,' he added. VanDiver noted that somewhere between 150,000 to 200,000 Afghans have resettlement cases. Sultani said that he and other Afghan refugees who waited for years to be relocated to the U.S. are now facing an uncertain future. 'Going back to Afghanistan is no option for us, and here [in Pakistan] we face many problems,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-refugees-in-pakistan-worry-as-us-suspends-resettlement-program/7949844.html	2025-01-24T17:58:23-08:00

State Department freezes new funding for nearly all US aid programs worldwide	WASHINGTON — The State Department ordered a sweeping freeze Friday on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance, making exceptions for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt. The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and other efforts. The U.S. provides more foreign aid globally than any other country, budgeting about $60 billion in 2023, or about 1% of the U.S. budget. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order, delivered in a cable sent to U.S. embassies worldwide, specifically exempted emergency food programs, such as those helping to feed millions in a widening famine in warring Sudan. The cable spells out the execution of the aid-freezing executive order President Donald Trump signed on Monday. But Friday's order especially disappointed humanitarian officials by not including specific exemptions for lifesaving health programs, such as clinics and immunization programs. A globally acclaimed anti-HIV program, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was among those apparently included in the spending freeze, slated to last at least three months. Known as PEPFAR, the program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. Some aid projects began receiving their first stop-work orders under the freeze Friday afternoon. Some leading aid organizations also were interpreting the directive as an immediate stop-work order for U.S.-funded aid work globally, a former senior U.S. Agency for International Development official said. Many would likely cease operations immediately so as not to incur more costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Suspending funding 'could have life or death consequences' for children and families around the world, said Abby Maxman, head of Oxfam America. 'By suspending foreign development assistance, the Trump administration is threatening the lives and futures of communities in crisis, and abandoning the United States' long-held bipartisan approach to foreign assistance which supports people based on need, regardless of politics,' Maxman said in a statement. At the United Nations, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said: 'These are bilateral decisions but nonetheless we expect those nations who have the capability to generously fund development assistance.' While Rubio's order exempted military assistance to allies Israel and Egypt from the freeze, there was no indication of a similar waiver to allow vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine through. The Biden administration pushed military aid to Ukraine out the door before leaving office because of doubts about whether Trump would continue it. But there is still about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for any future arms shipments to Ukraine, and it is now up to Trump to decide whether to spend it. The sweeping freeze begins enforcement of a pledge from Trump and other Republicans to crack down on U.S. aid programs. Florida Republican Representative Brian Mast, the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, promised this week that Republicans would question 'every dollar and every diplomat' in the State Department's budget to ensure it met their standards for strict necessity. The freeze is necessary to ensure that 'appropriations are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy,' the global cable stated. Within the next month, standards for a review of all foreign assistance are expected to be set to ensure that it is 'aligned with President Trump's foreign policy agenda,' the cable said. And within three months, the government-wide review is expected to be completed with a subsequent report to be produced for Rubio to make recommendations to the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-department-freezes-new-funding-for-nearly-all-us-aid-programs-worldwide/7949764.html	2025-01-24T16:02:23-08:00

Pandas are back in Washington, delighting National Zoo visitors	washington — Giant pandas have returned to the National Zoo in Washington, drawing joyful crowds. Two pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, made their public debut Friday in front of hundreds of excited fans, the first pandas at the zoo in more than a year. Lisa Barham came all the way from Cleveland, Ohio, with her son to see them. 'It's just fantastic to be able to experience this as a family,' she told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Bao Li is the son of Bao Bao, a giant panda who was born at the National Zoo in 2013 and was returned to China. 'I brought my little boy to see Bao Bao's little boy,' Barham said. The pair of pandas, who are both 3 years old, rolled in Washington’s newly fallen snow and munched on bamboo. Crowds lined up for hours before the zoo opened at 8 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the bears. The pandas arrived from China in October but have been in quarantine while their enclosure was renovated. National Zoo director Brandie Smith told VOA that the pandas are 'a symbol of happiness and joy.' 'The pandas to me are such a success story … a story of panda friendship between our cultures,' she said. Because of conservation efforts, the giant panda is no longer on the endangered species list. However, it is still listed as 'vulnerable.' Smith said that at the start of the zoo’s program with pandas, which began in the 1970s, the focus was on producing more pandas to create an 'insurance population' for the planet. 'We accomplished that, and now the focus is really on habitat,' she said. About 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat in Asia while another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, according to the National Zoo’s website. Any cubs born to the new pandas are returned to China to join that country’s breeding program. The pandas are in Washington on a 10-year lease from China. The National Zoo says it is paying the China Wildlife and Conservation Association $1 million per year for the animals. At an opening ceremony at the zoo Friday morning, students from Yu Ying Public Charter School, a dual Chinese and English school in Washington, wore panda ears and sang a song about friendship. The school's executive director, Carlie Fisher, told VOA that the 'pandas represent peace and goodwill.' The zoo relaunched its popular Panda Cam on Friday, with 40 cameras streaming images of the furry bears throughout the day. The site had 75,000 views by 11:30 a.m. on Friday, according to zoo officials. VOA Mandarin Service reporter Calla Yu contributed to this report. Some information came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pandas-are-back-in-washington-delighting-national-zoo-visitors/7949534.html	2025-01-24T14:31:36-08:00	
In Turkey, watchdogs note wave of arrests of Kurdish media	WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL — Turkish authorities this month detained six Kurdish journalists from cities across the country. All six are accused of being members of a 'terrorist organization,' a common charge used in legal cases against media in Turkey. The arrests came the same week that Turkey was named a leading jailer of journalists. Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, show 11 journalists currently detained for their work in Turkey, five of whom are Kurdish. Kurds are one of the world’s largest stateless ethnic groups, an estimated 30 million of whom span the Middle East countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Across those regions, CPJ data show, 10 Kurdish media workers are detained. CPJ Chief Executive Jodie Ginsberg told VOA the trend of minorities targeted for arrest is seen globally. 'Again, this is something that we see when we look at the prison numbers more generally as often a targeting, particularly of minority communities, journalists representing those communities,' Ginsberg said. The most recent media arrests in Turkey involved journalists at the Yeni Yasam daily newspaper and at Guncel Productions. Sukru Alpsoy, a lawyer for the journalists, told VOA their work was presented as evidence in the case. VOA called the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office but did not receive a response. The CPJ data offer a snapshot of journalists in custody on Dec. 1 of each year. But media analysts say many more are held throughout the year. In Turkey, seven journalists were among a group of people arrested at a protest in December over the deaths in northern Syria of two journalists. An estimated 24 journalists have been detained in the past two months, according to Bianet Media Monitoring. Istanbul-based journalist Diren Yurtsever told VOA she believes authorities want to stop the media from reporting. A reporter for the Kurdish Mezopotamya News Agency, Yurtsever spent six months in custody last year on terrorism charges. 'We face charges such as 'membership of a terrorist organization,' 'propaganda for a terrorist organization' or 'financing,'' she told VOA. 'But when we look at the issue of membership in the organization and the files of journalists, we see that the grounds for accusations are mostly news reports. 'I can say that there is a great injustice against journalists and a serious threat to the law and freedom of expression is manifesting itself,' she said. Dicle Muftuoglu, a Mezopotamya editor and co-chair of the Tigris Euphrates Journalists Association, said the arrests are linked to coverage. 'Members of the court or any force cannot interfere with the issues that a journalist discusses in his program, the news he makes, or the problems he raises on social media,' said Muftuoglu. 'But today we see that they are interfering in all of this.' The Turkish embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. In response to the latest arrests, the Coalition for Women in Journalism called for the detainees to be freed. 'This crackdown is part of a growing pattern of systematic repression, with the Kurdish press facing relentless persecution,' the media group said in a statement. Turkey ranks 158 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-turkey-watchdogs-note-wave-of-arrests-of-kurdish-media/7949520.html	2025-01-24T14:30:00-08:00

Legal team files UN complaint over jailed Bangladeshi journalists	WASHINGTON — Amid the political chaos in Bangladesh in August that included the ouster of the country's prime minister, journalists Farzana Rupa and Shakil Ahmed were arrested at an airport in the capital, Dhaka, while attempting to travel to Paris. More than 150 days have passed since then, and the married couple remains jailed in the South Asian country on accusations that their legal team rejects as politically motivated. 'This is a particularly absurd example of using the law to target critics, but unfortunately, it's still resulting in them remaining in prison,' human rights lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher, who is leading the couple's international legal team, told VOA. The international legal team representing the journalists filed a complaint Wednesday with the United Nations over their detention, which analysts say underscores broader challenges facing journalists in Bangladesh. Massive student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh in June 2024 and ultimately led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning and fleeing to India. She had led the country since 2009. About 870 people died in the protests, according to the health ministry led by interim Bangladesh government. While covering the violent demonstrations, several journalists were attacked, and two were killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of journalists who have been targeted were viewed as pro-Hasina. Rupa and Ahmed are among four journalists viewed as pro-Hasina who were still jailed in Bangladesh as of early December, according to CPJ. Rupa and Ahmed both worked at the Ekattor TV channel, which was considered pro-Hasina, and were critical of the protests, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism. Police claimed Rupa and Ahmed had incited Hasina's former government to kill protesters. The reporters were arrested in connection with the murder case of a garment worker who died during a demonstration in early August in Dhaka. Bangladeshi journalist Khairuzzaman Kamal, who previously worked with Rupa and is friends with Ahmed, said they are good journalists. 'They maintain their professional ethics very much,' said Kamal, of the Bangladesh Manobadhikar Sangbadik Forum journalist association. But other analysts say that, like many journalists in Bangladesh, they were pro-Hasina — but that doesn't mean they should be imprisoned on politically motivated charges. Even though Bangladesh has experienced significant media growth over the past 20 years, a lack of openness surrounding ownership and political affiliation has raised questions about editorial independence and threatened trust in the media, according to media reports. Gallagher, who is based in London, said the case against her clients is an example of retaliatory lawfare, which is when governments use and abuse the law to target critics. 'The intellectual hoops you have to jump through to claim that journalism in itself may have contributed to a mindset, which may have contributed to an attack, which may have contributed to a death is just legally nonsensical,' Gallagher said. Kamal agreed. 'It is a fabricated murder case against them because they are journalists,' the journalist said. By filing a complaint with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Gallagher said she hopes the group will determine that Rupa and Ahmed's jailings are arbitrary. 'What we're seeing here is entirely unjust imprisonment without due process,' she added. Bangladesh's Embassy in Washington, U.N. office in Geneva, and Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's emails requesting comment. Press freedom threatened Press freedom has been under threat for years in Bangladesh, according to watchdog groups such as Amnesty International and Reporters without Borders. Hasina's government was long accused of using severe tools, such as intimidating family members of exiled journalists, and harsh laws to stifle dissent and repress the media. In her last year in power, Bangladesh fell to 165th place out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, the country's worst ranking ever. 'It was very clear during Hasina's 15 years of rule in Bangladesh that the media was under tight control for a long time, and journalists have been constantly targeted because of their reporting,' Beh Lih Yi, CPJ Asia program coordinator, told VOA. Mubashar Hasan, a fellow at the University of Oslo, agreed. Hasan, who researches authoritarianism and press freedom in Bangladesh, told VOA that for years it was risky for journalists to report critically on issues involving the military and the prime minister's office. 'There were no-go places for their journalism,' Hasan said. After Hasina resigned in early August, Bangladesh formed an interim government led by politician and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. In an October interview with the country's largest paper, Prothom Alo, Yunus appeared to advocate for press freedom. 'Write as you please. Criticize,' he said. 'Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?' And in a November interview with the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, Yunus recognized that the murder accusations against journalists without evidence were unfair, saying, 'This was hurriedly done, following the old laws and practices.' More than 140 journalists have faced these accusations, according to Reporters Without Borders. The interim government's stated commitment to defend press freedom is a good sign for the future, Beh said. But in practice, the forms of repression facing journalists have merely changed shape under the interim government. Four journalists are still in jail, and in November, demonstrators attacked the offices of two major newspapers. Authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of several journalists, and the interim government canceled press accreditations for more than 160 reporters. 'What we are very alarmed by is even though the interim government has pledged to reform, what is happening does not actually reflect that commitment,' Beh said. 'They must not adopt the previous regime's playbook by using the law to target critics or by using the previous regime's playbook to settle old scores.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/legal-team-files-un-complaint-over-jailed-bangladeshi-journalists-/7949488.html	2025-01-24T14:15:00-08:00

US cities get creative clearing snow, ice after rare winter storm	Days after a winter storm dropped ice and record-breaking snow, cleanup efforts were underway Thursday in several major Southern U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana, where crews were removing snow the same way they remove trash, drink cups and plastic beads after Mardi Gras celebrations. Temperatures were gradually rising across the U.S. South, bringing hopes that remaining snow and ice would melt away. 'We have to be honest with ourselves — we're from Louisiana, we know crawfish, we know football, but we don't really know snow and ice and that's okay,' said Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development spokesperson Daniel Gitlin. 'It's going to go away and we're better off letting Mother Nature do what she needs to do right now.' Up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) of interstate highways were expected to remain closed until Friday due to treacherous patches of black ice, Gitlin said. Louisiana has nearly run out of its salt supply after treating roads, he added. In New Orleans, a private waste management firm has been contracted to repurpose equipment that's typically used to clean up Mardi Gras beads and cups to clear snow from the streets. IV Waste President Sidney Torres said his company has deployed a 15,000-liter (4,000-gallon) 'flusher' truck to spray water on the ground to soften the ice for removal in the historic and festive French Quarter. The truck normally sprays lemon-scented fragrance 'to get rid of that funky liquor, urine, puke smell from the night before,' Torres said. 'We're finding new solutions and better techniques to dealing with this.' Arkansas sent Louisiana snowplows, dump trucks, salt spreaders and other equipment, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said. Snow likely breaks records The snowfall likely broke several records across the region, including in Florida where a preliminary report of 25 centimeters (10 inches) in one town would set a record for the state, if confirmed. Snow totals reached 8 centimeters (3 inches) this week in Savannah, Georgia, the most that the state's oldest city has recorded since December 1989. The snow was lighter in metro Atlanta, Georgia, where the southern suburbs saw more snow and ice than areas north of the city. In Covington, southeast of Atlanta, Jesse Gentes used a flame thrower to de-ice the roads in his subdivision. In better weather, he typically uses the flame thrower for brush removal, he told television station WSB-TV. Light freezing rain was forecast Thursday in the port city of Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, where local officials had imposed an overnight curfew because of icy roads and frigid temperatures. Officials opened three warming stations where people could escape the biting chill, and nearly 4,000 residents of the county were still without power Thursday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. South Carolina reported at least one death in the storm. A 71-year-old man died from a medical condition while shoveling snow Thursday morning in Berkeley County, Coroner Darnell Hartwell said. About 8-10 centimeters (3-4 inches) of snow fell in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The snow and ice had staying power and left a mess on the roads in coastal South Carolina. In Charleston, South Carolina, ice that melted and then refroze overnight closed the James Island Connector, a bridge that links the city to its western suburbs. Police said on social media that 'while crews are working hard, it is unlikely to reopen soon.' Schools and county offices remained closed as officials in most areas south and east of the state capital, Columbia, asked people to stay home at least one more day. It was a similar story in North Carolina, where slick roads remained a danger to drivers after snow melted and then refroze overnight. Schools were also affected, including in Cumberland County where Fayetteville is located, where the school system announced that students would have an 'asynchronous' learning day allowing students to complete assignments at home. Several other school districts operated on a two-hour delay. Some school systems in central and south Alabama remained closed Thursday because of concerns about the remaining ice on roads or the possibility of frozen pipes in schools. In coastal Baldwin County, sections of Interstate 65 and Interstate 10 were shut down because of ice. Across the South, airports were gradually recovering from the weather interruption. Nationwide, about 600 flights scheduled to fly into or out of U.S. airports had been canceled by midday Thursday — a marked improvement over previous days when the storm was at its peak, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.com. Parts of river freeze Meanwhile in the northeast, places like New York were still dealing with bitter cold temperatures despite moments when the sun peeked through the clouds. Parts of New York's Hudson River turned to ice Thursday during recent cold weather in the city. The frozen surface split into blocks of ice with the city's majestic skyline looming on the distant bank of the river. The National Weather Service has issued a warning for wind chills in eastern parts of the U.S. In New York, the city is dealing with temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (around 20 degrees Fahrenheit) which are expected to last through the weekend.

Nigeria seeks $910 million to tackle worsening humanitarian crisis	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs have launched an appeal for $910 million to address an escalating humanitarian crisis in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan was unveiled Thursday at the U.N. House in Abuja. The appeal aims to raise nearly a billion dollars to provide lifesaving assistance to some 3.6 million people affected by the more than 15 years of insurgency and insecurity in northeast Nigeria. Officials said humanitarian needs have worsened recently due to climate shocks, including devastating floods, and deepening economic issues. Mohammed Malick Fall, the U.N. resident coordinator in Nigeria, highlighted the growing challenges. 'This occasion underscores our collective resolve as a community to millions of people here in Nigeria. We have seen a spike in the number of people facing food insecurity. We have also seen a rise in children suffering from malnutrition,' he said. 'In 2024, we experienced perhaps one of the worst floods. 'Humanitarian interventions are key in saving lives, but they can't be the solution for all the problems across Nigeria. What is required also is for development to step in, that we double down on peace building,' Fall added. The 2025 plan prioritizes food security, health care, water and sanitation, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups such as women, children and people with disabilities. The plan also seeks to tackle the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment while building the resilience of vulnerable communities. Fall noted that just 57% of last year’s funding target was achieved — a number that was still slightly higher than the global average. Nigeria’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Nentawe Yilwatda, underscored the importance of taking a proactive approach to the emergency. 'The 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan prioritizes saving lives, building resilience, and adopting adaptive strategies to address evolving challenges with limited resources. This plan shifts from a reactive to a proactive approach, aiming to mitigate disasters before they occur,' Yilwatda said. 'While the focus remains on Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, it also acknowledges growing humanitarian needs in the northwest and north-central regions.' Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states have been grappling with terrorism from Boko Haram and widespread insecurity from armed gangs for over 15 years, creating one of Africa's most severe humanitarian crises. Zubaida Umar, director-general of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, emphasized the need for collaboration. 'The success of this plan lies in collaboration, synergy, and a people-centered approach. The numbers in this report represent real lives — children, women and men, families whose resilience inspires us to act with urgency and compassion,' Umar said. The U.N. estimates that 33 million Nigerians will face food insecurity in 2025, up from 26.5 million last year. Among them, 2.5 million children are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate intervention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-seeks-910-million-to-tackle-worsening-humanitarian-crisis/7949382.html	2025-01-24T12:11:57-08:00	
Hamas announces hostages to be released in next exchange	Hamas on Friday announced the names of four Israeli women hostages whom the militant group is set to release Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the ceasefire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-announces-hostages-to-be-released-in-next-exchange/7949296.html	2025-01-24T11:37:56-08:00	
Ahead of election, media group accuses Belarus of crimes against humanity	WASHINGTON — Ahead of Belarus’ presidential election this weekend, a media advocacy group filed a complaint Friday with the International Criminal Court accusing the country’s longtime leader of crimes against humanity against journalists. The complaint, filed by Reporters Without Borders, known by French acronym RSF, accuses President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating a harsh crackdown on independent media that began after he claimed victory in the disputed 2020 election. That election was widely seen as rigged, with opposition candidates jailed or forced to flee. Security forces violently suppressed the subsequent mass protests. Paris-based RSF cited in its complaint the imprisoning and persecution of journalists and displacement of media workers as examples of crimes against humanity. 'RSF calls on the ICC Prosecutor to include these crimes against journalists in its preliminary investigation,' Antoine Bernard, RSF’s director of advocacy and assistance, said in a statement. Since the crackdown on independent media began, Belarus has ranked among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Belarusian media experts say the dire environment has made it harder to access credible information. 'The Belarusian information space is tightly controlled by the government,' Natalia Belikova, the head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. Repression against journalists and activists has been increasing in the lead up to the election, she said. Press Club Belarus counts more than 40 journalists currently jailed in the country. The European Parliament and exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskayahave condemned the upcoming election in Belarus as a sham. Since 2020, the Belarusian government has pressured independent media through raids on news outlets, blocking websites and designating media organizations as 'extremist.' The harsh environment forced some reporters to quit their jobs. Meanwhile, hundreds of other journalists fled into exile, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 'For five years, the Belarusian regime has systematically persecuted independent voices, starting with journalists,' Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said in a statement. Belikova said she thinks the complaint to the ICC is significant. 'On the level of raising the profile of repression in Belarus, especially against journalists and free press, I think this is a very important move,' she said. But Belikova added that she wasn’t sure whether the complaint will improve the crisis facing Belarusian journalists. The office of the ICC prosecutor said it does not comment on complaints but confirmed it had received one from RSF. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story. The assault on independent media has created an environment where state-run propaganda can thrive, according to analysts. Beginning last week, the Belarusian state-run television network ONT has aired a series of propaganda films that feature three jailed journalists. The journalists are seen in prison facilities, looking emaciated and exhausted as they are asked questions. The journalists — Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk, who work for VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Ihar Karney, who previously contributed to RFE/RL — are jailed on charges that press freedom groups view as politically motivated. The ONT propaganda series accused the journalists of trying to 'set Belarus on fire.' 'It is a very bad and malicious practice. It is against all human rights,' Belikova said about the interviews. Belikova said the interviews were likely intended to discredit RFE/RL in the eyes of Belarusians. RFE/RL’s Belarusian Service is one of the main independent outlets delivering independent news to people inside the country. RFE/RL said it had no comment on the interview series. Despite the proliferation of state-run propaganda, Belarusians still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. Belarus has a population of around 9 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-election-media-group-accuses-belarus-of-crimes-against-humanity/7949238.html	2025-01-24T10:55:49-08:00

Lunar New Year travel offers boost to China’s economic woes	China’s annual mass migration ahead of the Lunar New Year will peak with billions of trips anticipated during this year’s holiday, which begins Tuesday. An estimated 9 billion trips are expected. This year’s holiday lasts from Jan. 28 through Feb. 4 and marks the arrival of the Year of the Snake. Authorities in China extended the annual break an extra day, so the public holiday will last eight days this year. During the holiday, travel is expected to pick up domestically and internationally. The government said it expects trips by train to surpass 510 million, with 90 million more traveling by air. Inside the country, most will travel by car. For trips overseas, travel to Southeast Asia has surged, with ticket volumes to Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia rising by more than 50%, according to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Additionally, demand for travel to Hong Kong has nearly doubled, and Japan is seeing a 58% increase in airline ticket purchases. While the Lunar New Year is known as a festive time characterized by colorful lanterns, parades and lion dances, it holds more than just cultural significance to Chinese authorities who see the period as an opportunity to boost a sluggish economy. That is one key reason authorities increased the holiday to eight days. They also launched several efforts to help revive weak consumer spending, such as promoting winter-themed holiday destinations and ensuring affordable airfares, according to officials at a State Council press conference in Beijing. Despite the efforts, Reuters reported businesses and consumers appear to be spending less than usual during the holiday season, citing concerns over a prolonged property slump and worries over job security. Throughout the past year, China has implemented a series of measures aimed at addressing those concerns, including stimulus measures such as cutting interest rates, increasing pensions and widening trade-in programs for consumer goods. One industry that appears to have gotten a boost from the festival season is cinema. The film industry in China had struggled recently, seeing a 22.6% decrease in total box office revenue in 2024. However, according to data from Maoyan, a Chinese ticketing platform, movie tickets exceeded $55 million by Jan. 23, the fastest presales for the Lunar New Year season. A large part of that increased demand has been from the film 'Legends of the Condor Heroes,' starring Xiao Zhan, an actor and singer who is also a brand ambassador for luxury goods companies such as Gucci and Tod's. Shops and restaurants also hope to see an increase in spending that mirrors the film industry over the course of the holiday. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lunar-new-year-travel-offers-boost-to-china-s-economic-woes/7949160.html	2025-01-24T09:38:50-08:00	
Court bars Oath Keepers founder from Washington without approval	WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday barred Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes from entering Washington without the court's approval after U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the far-right extremist group leader's 18-year prison sentence for orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta issued the order two days after Rhodes visited the Capitol, where he met with at least one lawmaker, chatted with others and defended his actions during a mob's attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Rhodes was released from a Maryland prison a day earlier. Mehta’s order also applies to other Oath Keepers members who were convicted of charges that they participated in a violent plot to attack the Capitol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-bars-oath-keepers-founder-from-washington-without-approval/7949095.html	2025-01-24T09:29:46-08:00	
Drought led to 71,000 ‘excess deaths’ in Somalia, report shows	WASHINGTON — A study finds that severe drought plaguing parts of Somalia since 2022 has killed at least 71,000 people beyond the number expected. About 40% of the lives lost were children under the age of 5, said the study, commissioned by the U.N. Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization and Somalia’s Ministry of Health. The study covered the period between January 2022 and June 2024. In an interview with VOA Somali, Dr. Najib Isse Dirie, the deputy director for research at Mogadishu’s SIMAD University, which helped carry out the study, said the excess deaths were the result of five failed rainy seasons that brought parts of Somalia to the brink of famine. 'During the drought and after, the people experienced a significant 'drought-related excess' in different cases,' he said. 'Living in overcrowding IDP camps, loss of their livelihoods, and the lack of rainfall severely impacted their crop yields and made them vulnerable.' Speaking at the report launch in Mogadishu on Wednesday, the WHO’s representative to Somalia, Dr. Renee van De Weerdt Renhilde, said the study is an unpleasant reminder. 'The findings of this study highlight the profound impact that the 2022–2024 drought has had on the lives of the Somali people. ... This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for continued support and resilience-building efforts in Somalia,' she said. 'This also underlines the critical importance of strengthening Somalia’s health emergency prevention, preparedness, readiness and resilience system to effectively respond to emergencies and provide sustained care for people in need,' she added. 'WHO continues to collaborate with the Somali government and partners to ensure that communities are not only protected during crises but also empowered to withstand and recover from future shocks.' At the launching ceremony, Somali Health Minister Dr. Ali Hadji Adam Abubakar explained his county’s plans to limit the impact of future droughts by giving priority to vulnerable children and women. 'For my ministry, our focus is on creating a strong and robust health system as the cornerstone of a healthy and thriving Somali society,' Abubakar said. As it launched an appeal this week to raise $1.43 billion, the U.N. issued a warning that about 6 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian aid this year. In a statement, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, 'Somalia continues to face a complex, protracted humanitarian crisis,' pointing out that conflict, insecurity, disease outbreaks, and recurrent shocks from climatic phenomena such as drought and floods further worsen Somalia's humanitarian needs. In 2011, a famine in Somalia killed more than a quarter-million people. The study was commissioned by UNICEF and the WHO and carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, and Somalia’s SIMAD University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-led-to-71-000-excess-deaths-in-somalia-report-shows/7949102.html	2025-01-24T09:26:52-08:00	
London court says US mom can be extradited in children's killings	LONDON — A London judge on Friday rejected a U.S. mother's challenge to be extradited to Colorado to face murder charges in the deaths of two of her young children. Judge John Zani said in Westminster Magistrates Court that it would now be up to the British Home Secretary to order Kimberlee Singler returned to the United States. Singler, 36, is accused of two counts of first-degree murder in the December 2023 shooting and stabbings of her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and one count of attempted murder in the knife slashing of her 11-year-old daughter. She also faces three counts of child abuse and one count of assault. Singler’s attorney had argued that sending her back to the U.S. would violate European human rights law, in part, because she faces a sentence of life in prison without parole in Colorado if convicted of first-degree murder. Such a sentence would be inhumane because it offers no prospect for release even if she is rehabilitated, attorney Edward Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that despite an option for a Colorado governor to commute her sentence at some point, it was 'political suicide' to do so. Experts for the defense had originally said that a life sentence had never been commuted in Colorado. But prosecutors later found that Governor John Hickenlooper in 2018 commuted life sentences of five men convicted of murder. The defense countered that three of those sentences were not life without parole and two were for men who committed their crime between the ages of 18 and 21, which is sometimes considered a mitigating factor at sentencing because of their relative youth. 'This defendant, Kimberlee Singler, has no real prospect of release no matter what progress she makes' behind bars, Fitzgerald said. Prosecutor Joel Smith said the judge only had to consider if there is a mechanism that could allow Singler to be freed someday. 'Prospect of release — that is not your concern,' Smith told the judge at a hearing in December. Zani said in his ruling that there was an option in Colorado to release an inmate serving a life sentence. 'I am satisfied that the defendant has failed to vault the hurdle necessary in order to succeed in the challenges raised,' the judge said. Fitzgerald said he planned to appeal. Singler has denied that she harmed her children. She told police that her ex-husband had either carried out the killings or hired a hitman. Singler had superficial knife wounds and was initially treated as a victim. But that changed when her surviving daughter, who initially said she had been attacked by an intruder, told police her mother tried to kill her. After her daughter changed her story, police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, but she had fled. She was found four days later in London’s posh Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. The girl told police that her mother gave the children milk with a powdery substance to drink and told them to close their eyes as she guided them into a sibling’s bedroom, prosecutors said. Singler cut her neck and, as the girl begged her to stop, she slashed her again. The girl said her mother had a gun. 'The defendant told her that God was telling her to do it and that the children’s father would take them away,' Smith said at a previous hearing. Police found Aden Wentz, 7, and Elianna 'Ellie' Wentz, 9, dead when they entered the Colorado Springs apartment on Dec. 19. They had been shot and stabbed. Although Singler blamed her husband, authorities said he had a solid alibi backed up by GPS records that showed he had been driving a truck at the time of the killings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/london-court-says-us-mom-can-be-extradited-in-children-s-killings/7949040.html	2025-01-24T08:37:07-08:00	
Afghan Taliban condemn ICC arrest warrants for leadership	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan's ruling Taliban on Friday condemned the International Criminal Court's request for arrest warrants against their supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice for alleged persecution of women and girls. The Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The strongly worded English-language statement follows Thursday’s announcement by the chief ICC prosecutor that he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who has been serving as the chief justice of the country since the Taliban seized power in 2021. Prosecutor Karim Khan cited a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process for concluding that the Taliban leaders 'are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' Khan said that persecution has persisted since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after nearly two decades of insurgency against the internationally recognized Kabul government and U.S.-led Western forces. 'It is unfortunate that such baseless allegations are being leveled against the honorable leaders of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] at a time when Afghanistan enjoys nationwide peace, its people have breathed a sigh of relief … and numerous other miseries and inhumane activities have been eradicated,' the Taliban ministry asserted. The Taliban takeover has almost ended years of war-related hostilities in the impoverished South Asian nation, leaving millions of Afghans in need of humanitarian assistance. 'Regrettably, this institution had turned a blind eye to the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their domestic allies during their twenty-year occupation of Afghanistan,' the Taliban statement claimed Friday. Akhundzada has issued dozens of edicts over the past three years in line with his interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, from his base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. The decrees have instituted sweeping restrictions on women and girls that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' The Haqqani-led Taliban Supreme Court has implemented what it claims is a Sharia-based criminal justice system, leading to public floggings of hundreds of Afghan men and women in packed sports stadiums on allegations such as adultery, sodomy, eloping, and other crimes. Several Afghans also have been executed publicly under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. Girls older than 12 are banned from pursuing education, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The de facto authorities have rejected persistent U.N.-led calls for reversing all restrictions on the female Afghan population. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said on Thursday. Amnesty International on Friday described the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against the two Taliban leaders as an 'important step toward justice for Afghan women' and other vulnerable groups in the country. 'This is a crucial step to hold accountable all those allegedly responsible for the gender-based deprivation of fundamental rights to education, to free movement and free expression, to private and family life, to free assembly,' said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general. She also urged the ICC prosecutor to 'reconsider his decision in 2021 to deprioritize investigations' into war crimes allegedly committed by former Afghan government security apparatus, the U.S. military, and allied troops during their 20-year presence in Afghanistan. 'This decision risks contributing to perceptions of a selective approach to international justice, which prioritizes the interests of powerful states and their allies over the right to justice of victims of crimes under international law,' Callamard said, referring to Thursday’s announcement by the ICC prosecutor. The U.S.-led foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan just days after Taliban insurgents swept back to power in Kabul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-condemn-icc-arrest-warrants-for-leadership/7949054.html	2025-01-24T08:27:16-08:00

Chocolate industry braces as Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa crop	Ivory Coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tons compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tons, regulator and industry sources said. A poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. Analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices increase by a percentage in the teens. Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but a lack of rain and excessive heat since November across all its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in April. The unfavorable conditions mean that the first beans will start to arrive in ports in June at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said. 'There is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,' said a pod counter who had just visited Ivory Coast farms. His words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons. 'Like everyone else, we're seeing the same thing. The mid-crop harvest will be one of the worst in 15 years,' one of the officials said. He added that the regulator had sold only about 250,000 tons in export contracts to grinders, preferring to be cautious. The regulator sources said the entire mid-crop harvest would be sold to local grinders to guarantee them the volumes necessary to maintain their activity. A dozen planters and middlemen across the West African country described the situation as unprecedented, characterized by a total absence of flowers and small pods after those that appeared in December and January dried up in the high heat. 'Even if the rain comes today ... it's already too late,' said Paul Kouame Kouakou, who owns four hectares of cocoa in Duekoue, a town in west Ivory Coast. It usually takes a flower around 22 weeks to become a mature pod. While the harvest was expected to start in April, there will be no cocoa until at least June, the farmer said. 'Usually, it's around November and December that we get the rains that herald the mid-crop harvest, but this year there's been no rain so far, and February and March are the hottest months,' said another pod counter. He visited dozens of plantations that did not have any sign of flowers or pods, which he called 'very bad news' for the crop.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chocolate-industry-braces-as-ivory-coast-expects-dire-cocoa-crop/7948916.html	2025-01-24T07:03:37-08:00

Israeli forces to stay in south Lebanon beyond withdrawal deadline	JERUSALEM — Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon beyond a Sunday deadline stipulated in a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah because the terms of the agreement have not been fully implemented, the Israeli prime minister's office said on Friday. Under the agreement, which began on Nov. 27, Hezbollah weapons and fighters must be removed from areas south of the Litani River and Israeli troops should withdraw as the Lebanese military deploys into the region, all within a 60-day timeframe due to conclude on Sunday at 4 a.m. The deal, brokered by the United States and France, ended more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah. The fighting peaked with a major Israeli offensive that left Hezbollah severely weakened and displaced more than 1.2 million people in Lebanon. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have designated Hezbollah as a terror group. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the Israeli military's withdrawal process was 'contingent on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani.' 'Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States,' the statement said. There was no immediate comment from Lebanon or Hezbollah. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hezbollah said on Thursday that any delay of Israel's withdrawal would be an unacceptable breach of the agreement, with which the Lebanese state would have to deal 'through all means and methods guaranteed by international charters.' Israel said its campaign against Hezbollah aimed to secure the return of tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah rocket fire. It inflicted major blows on Hezbollah during the conflict, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and thousands of the group's fighters and destroying much of its arsenal. Hezbollah was further weakened in December when its Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled, cutting its overland supply route from Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-to-stay-in-south-lebanon-beyond-withdrawal-deadline/7948894.html	2025-01-24T06:36:49-08:00

Russia, Ukraine report large-scale overnight drone attacks	Officials in Ukraine say Russia launched a barrage of drones in an overnight attack Friday killing at least two civilians, wounding several others and damaging commercial and residential buildings. The interior ministry said two victims were killed by drone debris in the central Kyiv region. It said a multistory residential building and commercial buildings were among the infrastructure that sustained damage during the attack. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said air defenses intercepted and destroyed some 120 drones over a dozen regions, including Moscow, overnight Friday, launched by Ukraine. No casualties were reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he would talk soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to push the Russian leader to end his nearly three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. 'Millions of young lives are being wasted. That war is horrible,' Trump, via video link from Washington, told global business leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said that 'Ukraine is ready to make a deal,' although no peace negotiations have been announced. 'This is a war that never should’ve started.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he would ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cut global oil prices, now about $77 a barrel, to curb Russia’s oil revenues, which it uses to fund the war. 'If the price comes down,' Trump said, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' 'It’s so important to get that done,' he said. 'It’s time to end it.' Trump’s new remarks on the war came a day after he described the conflict as a 'ridiculous war' and told Putin in a social media message that if he didn’t move to end it, the U.S. would impose new tariffs, taxes and sanctions on Russian exports to the West. But the Kremlin was unmoved by Trump’s threat, saying Thursday it did not see any particularly new elements in U.S. policy toward Russia. 'He likes these methods, at least he liked them during his first presidency,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said Russia remains ready for 'mutually respectful dialogue' with the United States as Trump starts a four-year term in the White House.

US agents raid New Jersey worksite as Trump escalates immigration crackdown	WASHINGTON — U.S. immigration agents rounded up undocumented migrants as well as American citizens in a raid of a Newark, New Jersey, worksite on Thursday that the city's mayor said involved detaining a military veteran and violations of the people's rights. The raid in New Jersey's most populous city, hailed in the past by Mayor Ras Baraka for its 'sanctuary' policies protecting migrants, follows President Donald Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump issued a raft of executive orders after taking office on Monday that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration. He has taken steps to punish officials who resist enforcement of his sweeping crackdown. In a raid of a business establishment in Newark, outside New York City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents failed to produce a warrant as they detained 'undocumented residents as well as citizens,' Baraka said in a statement. 'One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,' Baraka said. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said that agents 'may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity as was the case during a targeted enforcement operation at a worksite today in Newark.' The spokesperson said that ICE was investigating the incident. Baraka said the raid had violated the citizens' rights under the U.S. Constitution. 'Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,' he said. Neither Baraka nor ICE identified the business raided by name. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on X that the Trump administration arrested 538 people Thursday, describing all of them as 'illegal immigrant criminals.' She said they included members of a Venezuelan prison gang and people convicted of sex crimes. Leavitt did not provide more details. A range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Other studies find that immigrants in the U.S. illegally also do not commit crimes at a higher rate. Sanctuary cities Baraka, the Newark mayor, is one of the first local officials in the U.S. to issue a statement on a specific raid following the start of Trump's immigration crackdown. In 2017, he signed an executive order cementing Newark's sanctuary status and was a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies during the president's first term. Of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with temporary status in 2022, about 44% lived in states with 'sanctuary' laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. That figure does not include those in sanctuary cities and counties in places without a statewide law, such as New Mexico. U.S. media outlets reported that federal law enforcement and ICE agents had arrested nearly 500 undocumented migrants wanted for outstanding crimes in sanctuary cities, including some from New York and New Jersey. The reports cited ICE officials who said the arrests took place Tuesday and Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agents-raid-new-jersey-worksite-as-trump-escalates-immigration-crackdown/7948613.html	2025-01-23T22:31:51-08:00	
Houthi rebels release crew of vessel seized in Red Sea in 2023	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Yemen's Houthi rebels have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war. The move by the Iranian-backed Houthis marks their latest effort to de-escalate their attacks following a ceasefire in Gaza. However, it came as U.S. President Donald Trump moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. The Houthis said they released the sailors after mediation by Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that's long been an interlocutor with the Houthis. A Royal Air Force of Oman jet took a flight to Yemen earlier Wednesday and took off again about an hour after the Houthi announcement with the crew, who smiled as they stepped off into freedom in Muscat. The Houthis also said Hamas separately requested the release of the ship's crew of 25, who included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico. 'This step comes in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza,' the Houthis said in a statement on rebel-controlled SABA news agency. In the Philippines, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed the release of 17 Filipino crew members, describing the moment as an 'utmost joy.' The Filipinos returned to their home country Thursday to welcomes from their families and government officials. Bulgaria’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the release of two Bulgarians identified by officials as the ship’s captain, Lyubomir Chanev, and assistant captain, Danail Veselinov. A government jet was on the way to Oman to bring the Bulgarians home, the ministry said. Hans Grundberg, the United Nations’ special envoy to Yemen, called the crew’s release 'heartwarming news that puts an end to the arbitrary detention and separation that they and their families endured for more than a year.' 'This is a step in the right direction, and I urge Ansar Allah to continue these positive steps on all fronts, including ending all maritime attacks,' he added, using another name for the Houthis. Vessel's link to Israeli billionaire The Houthis said they hijacked the Galaxy Leader over its connection to Israel. The attack launched the rebels' campaign targeting ships in international waters in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects them. A representative for the Galaxy Leader's owners had no comment Wednesday. The Bahamas-flagged vessel is affiliated with an Israeli billionaire, Abraham 'Rami' Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. The Houthi attack on the Galaxy Leader saw the rebels launch a helicopter-borne raid. Propaganda footage of the raid has been played constantly by the Houthis, who even shot a music video aboard the ship at one point. On Monday, the Houthis signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip, but warned wider assaults could resume if needed. However, it likely won’t be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that’s crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The release of the vessel's crew now may have been an effort to curry favor with the U.S., though the ship still remains moored off the Yemeni port city of Hodeida. 'This gesture by the Houthis may be intended as a goodwill measure towards the new Trump administration,' said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha, of the Basha Report risk advisory firm. However, Trump signed an order urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to reinstate a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis. Rubio separately called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, who have led a coalition battling the Houthis since 2015. 'Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the White House said. Biden lifted the designation early in his term, citing the humanitarian threat that the sanctions posed to ordinary Yemenis and to back an de facto ceasefire that still broadly holds in Yemen's war. Houthi attacks targeted over 100 commercial ships The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Houthis have sunk two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they only targeted ships linked to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthi-rebels-release-crew-of-vessel-seized-in-red-sea-in-2023-/7948607.html	2025-01-23T22:15:20-08:00	
US Air Force looks to upgrade Cyprus airbase as humanitarian staging post for the Middle East	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — Experts from the U.S. Air Force are looking at ways to upgrade Cyprus' premier air base for use as a humanitarian staging post in future operations in the Middle East, a Cypriot official told The Associated Press on Thursday. Cyprus, which is only 184 kilometers from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has acted as a transit point for the repatriation of foreign nationals fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond on numerous occasions in the past. It has also served as a transit point for humanitarian aid to Gaza. Experts from the 435th Contingency Response Group based out of Ramstein, Germany, will spend the next few days at Andreas Papandreou Air Force Base to assess the upgrade needed to accommodate a wide array of U.S. air assets and other forces. A key priority is to ensure air traffic safety in and around the base, which abuts the island's second-largest civilian airport, the official said. The base's location makes it easy to transfer evacuees onto civilian aircraft at the adjacent airport for their trip home. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the details of the experts' visit. Air traffic safety would need to be enhanced through new high-tech installations, including state-of-the-art radar, to ensure the independent operation of civilian and military aircraft at safe distances. 'The Americans are very specific on safety issues and want to make some upgrades to further improve the base's safety,' the official said. Other essential upgrades include expanding both the base itself and the runway to accommodate more transport and fighter aircraft. Hardened shelters to protect those air assets are also envisioned. The Cyprus government agreed to the air base upgrade assessment following the recent deployment of a U.S. Marine contingent at the base. The Marines, who were equipped with V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft, were on stand-by in the event of a swift evacuation of US citizens from nearby Lebanon during Israel's strikes against Hezbollah targets late last year. Deputy government spokesman Yannis Antoniou told the state broadcaster Thursday that any use of the base by the forces of the U.S. or other nations would require prior Cyprus government approval. He insisted the air base would not act as a forward base for military strike operations against targets in the region. 'We've shown interest in working with (US. Forces) because we consider this to serve the vital interests of the Cyprus Republic,' Antoniou said, adding that in their report, the USAF experts will offer an estimate of the upgrade costs and which percentage of those the US government would be willing to cover. Bilateral relations between European Union member Cyprus and the U.S., especially in terms of military cooperation, have grown significantly over the last few years following a pledge by Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides to affirm the ethnically divided country's 'clear Western orientation.' A manifestation of those ties was last week's directive by former President Joe Biden that allows Cyprus to buy arms from the U.S. government and get surplus American military equipment. The Cypriot government noted the development as a tangible acknowledgment of Cyprus' reliability as a U.S. partner in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-looks-to-upgrade-cyprus-airbase-as-humanitarian-staging-post-for-the-middle-east/7948601.html	2025-01-23T21:09:23-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Crackdown in Iran's Kurdistan: Arrests amid protests of death sentences	Several individuals in Sanaa, Saqiz and Sardasht, in Iran’s Kurdistan region, have been arrested for participating in strikes protesting the death sentences of Pakhshan Azizi and Varisha Moradi, two ethnic Kurdish women. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) reported the detention of six citizens in Sanaa, while three others were arrested in Saqiz and Sardasht by the Ministry of Intelligence. The strikes, organized by six Kurdish political parties, aimed to prevent the executions through peaceful civil action. In response, Iranian security forces threatened market representatives, sealed shops and took measures to suppress the protests.

Italy's highest court upholds slander conviction of Amanda Knox	Italy's highest court on Thursday upheld the slander conviction of American defendant Amanda Knox in a case related to the sensationalized 2007 murder of her British roommate. Knox was convicted of slandering her former boss, Congolese bar owner Patrick Lumumba, by falsely accusing him of murdering Meredith Kercher. A 21-year-old exchange student, Kercher was found stabbed to death in 2007 in the Perugia apartment she shared with Knox. While being interrogated, Knox, who was 20 at the time, signed two statements prepared by police regarding her accusation against Lumumba. Knox later wrote a handwritten note questioning her false accusation. Last year, an appeals court in Florence handed Knox a three-year sentence for wrongly accusing Lumumba. Knox, now 37 years old, had already served nearly four years during the investigation, initial murder trial and first appeal. She was convicted twice before Italy's highest court finally exonerated her of the crime in 2015. She is not at risk of any more jail time. Knox had appealed the slander conviction based on a European Court of Human Rights ruling that said her rights had been violated by police failure to provide a lawyer and adequate translator during a lengthy night of questioning just days after Kercher was killed. With the appeal, Knox was aiming to clear her name in Rome's Court of Cassation in the last remaining legal case against her following a nearly two-decades-long legal saga. But on Thursday, Judge Monica Boni confirmed the slander conviction. Knox, who did not attend the court, maintained her innocence in a post on X. 'It's a surreal day,' Knox said. 'I've just been found guilty yet again of a crime I didn't commit.' Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was surprised by the conviction. 'We cannot believe it. A totally unjust decision for Amanda and unexpected in our eyes,' he said. 'We are incredulous.' But Lumumba said he was satisfied with the verdict. 'Amanda was wrong. This verdict has to accompany her for the rest of her life,' he told The Associated Press. Rudy Guede, originally from the Ivory Coast, was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing Kercher. He was released in 2021 after serving most of his sentence. He denied killing Kercher. Knox's lengthy legal saga was fodder for tabloids around the world and spawned books, movies and documentaries. Knox herself is currently producing a Hulu mini-series about her wrongful conviction and fight to clear her name. Social activist Monica Lewinsky is also producing the series. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-highest-court-upholds-slander-conviction-of-amanda-knox/7948531.html	2025-01-23T17:45:21-08:00	
VOA Uzbek: Human rights conditions have worsened across Central Asia, HRW says	A 2024 Human Rights Watch report released last week describes the five Central Asian republics as an environment under law-breaking and authoritarian governments. There were no major improvements in the rule of law in any of the Central Asian republics in 2024, HRW, the New York-based international organization, reported. The situation remained grim and, in some cases, worsened in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, according to HRW's annual analysis. The HRW analysis emphasized that courts are not independent, parliaments are puppets, and presidents are autocrats.

Multiple blazes continue in southern California	Firefighters in southern California continued to confront multiple blazes on Thursday amid high winds and dry conditions. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake broke out Wednesday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for areas near the Hughes Fire. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, L.A. County’s health officer, said in a statement. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County resulted in evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. The evacuation warning for the Sepulveda Fire near Interstate 405 late Wednesday was lifted after firefighters stopped the fire’s progress after it had burned through less than 1 square kilometer. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said Thursday the 'very gusty' offshore Santa Ana winds will continue in southern California with gusts that could reach as high at 105 kph in some mountain ranges. The winds, combined with Southern California’s 'very low humidity and dry antecedent conditions,' prompted the center to continue a Critical Risk of Fire Weather alert for Thursday and an Elevated Fire Weather Outlook for Friday. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire with overnight aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire, northwest of Los Angeles, swelled to burn an area of more than 41 square kilometers near the Lake Castaic recreation area. The fire was about 14% contained early Thursday as forecasters warned of another day of dry and windy conditions that could make it difficult to keep fires from spreading. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said some rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. In addition to the Hughes Fire, crews are still battling the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades fire, at 95 square kilometers, is about 70% contained, while the Eaton, at 56 square kilometers, is about 95% contained, according to file officials. The fires that broke out in Southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles on Friday. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-blazes-continue-in-southern-california/7948529.html	2025-01-23T17:08:31-08:00	
Trump orders release of last JFK, RFK, King assassination files	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the declassification Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death. Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on the 1960s assassinations of JFK's younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 'That's a big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this for years, for decades,' Trump told reporters as he signed the order in the Oval Office of the White House. After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide, saying, 'Give that to RFK Jr.,' JFK's nephew and the current president's nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The order Trump signed requires the 'full and complete release' of the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when releasing most of the documents. 'It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,' the order said. Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most recently at his inauguration on Monday. The U.S. National Archives has released tens of thousands of records in recent years related to the November 22, 1963, assassination of President Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security concerns. It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December 2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records — which total 5 million pages — had now been made public. The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories. A gesture to RFK Jr. Trump's move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers of those conspiracies — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself. RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was 'overwhelming evidence the CIA was involved' in his uncle JFK's murder and 'very convincing' evidence the agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert F. Kennedy. The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian, was convicted of his murder. Thousands of John Kennedy assassination-related documents from the National Archives were released during Trump's first term in office, but he also held some back on national security grounds. Then-President Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022 documents release that a 'limited' number of files would continue to be held back at the request of unspecified 'agencies.' Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and FBI. Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th U.S. president. Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, as he was being transferred from the city jail. Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film 'JFK' have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson. King was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in 1998, but King's children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was the assassin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-release-of-last-jfk-rfk-king-assassination-files/7948500.html	2025-01-23T16:58:39-08:00	
Fighting reaches outskirts of eastern Congo's largest city as rebels close in	GOMA, CONGO — Panic spread in eastern Congo's main city on Thursday, with M23 rebels steadily inching closer to Goma and seizing a nearby town as they battle the Congolese army. Bombs were heard going off in the city's distant outskirts, and hundreds of wounded civilians were brought in to the main hospital from the area of the fighting. The rebel group has been making significant advances in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, which is home to around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. On Thursday, the rebels took Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma and one of the last main routes into the provincial capital still under government control, according to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, along the border with Rwanda, in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced by the fighting. Earlier this month, the M23 captured the towns of Minova, Katale and Masisi, west of Goma. 'The people of Goma have suffered greatly, like other Congolese,' an M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X. 'M23 is on its way to liberate them, and they must prepare to welcome this liberation.' The M23 seized Goma in 2012 and controlled it for over a week. As news of the fighting spread, schools in Goma sent students home Thursday morning. 'We are told that the enemy wants to enter the city. That's why we are told to go home,' Hassan Kambale, a 19-year-old high school student, said. 'We are constantly waiting for the bombs.' Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago. Rwanda's government denies the claim but last year admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. On Wednesday, Congo's minister of communication, Patrick Muyaya, told French broadcaster France 24 that war with Rwanda is an 'option to consider.' Late Thursday, Guterres condemned, 'in the strongest terms, the renewed offensive launched by the 23 March Movement [M23],' including the 'seizure of Sake.' 'This offensive has a devastating toll on the civilian population and heightened the risk of a broader regional war,' Guterres' statement read. He also urged 'all parties to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law.' Earlier in the day, Congolese authorities claimed that the military pushed back an attack from the 'Rwandan army' on Sake. The Associated Press was unable to verify if Rwanda's army took part in the offensive. 'The population is in panic. The M23 now control large parts of the town,' said Leopold Mwisha, president of civil society of the area of Sake. Guterres said he was 'deeply troubled' by the most recent reports about the 'presence of Rwandan troops on Congolese soil and continued support to the M23.' The U.S. Embassy in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in a notice Thursday warned of 'an increase in the severity of armed conflict near Sake' and advised U.S. nationals in North Kivu province, which includes Goma, to be on the alert in case they needed to leave their homes on short notice. The United Kingdom also issued a travel advisory that said M23 now controls Sake and urged British nationals to leave Goma while roads remained open. Many Sake residents have joined the more than 178,000 people who have fled the M23 advance in the last two weeks. The CBCA Ndosho hospital in Goma was stretched to the limit, with hundreds of newly wounded on Thursday. Thousands escaped the fighting by boat on Wednesday, making their way north across Lake Kivu and spilling out of packed wooden boats in Goma, some with bundles of their belongings strapped around their foreheads. Neema Matondo said she fled Sake during the night, when the first explosions started to go off. She recounted seeing people around her torn to pieces and killed. 'We escaped, but unfortunately,' others did not, Matondo told AP. Mariam Nasibu, who fled Sake with her three children, was in tears — one of her children lost a leg, blown off in the relentless shelling. 'As I continued to flee, another bomb fell in front of me, hitting my child,' she said, crying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fighting-reaches-outskirts-of-eastern-congo-s-largest-city-as-rebels-close-in-/7948493.html	2025-01-23T16:40:46-08:00	
Will Trump spark a mineral 'gold rush' in Greenland?	NUUK, GREENLAND — The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting alarm from European allies. Trump's words were echoed in a January 12 interview on 'Fox News Sunday' by Vice President JD Vance, who said, 'There is a deal to be made in Greenland,' and that the island has 'a lot of great natural resources.' Until now, Greenland's mining industry has struggled to turn a profit, but could that be about to change? 'Full of minerals' Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark, monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium deposits and other minerals. The mine's operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock from Greenland's western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America, where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass, paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit aluminum deposits within the anorthosite. 'Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally, minerals available all over the place,' Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina's managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview. Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading. China competition The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China. Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary for 'international security.' His comments caused a political storm in Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity. 'His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in Greenland,' Jensen said. 'So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think it's important that both from the industry side but also from the political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and the U.S.' 'Not for sale' Greenland's government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is responsible for the island's security. Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for resources, emphasized the government's long-held response to Trump's interest: Open for business, but not for sale. 'We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the U.S. State Department, and we've been trying to advocate for that for some time,' she told VOA. Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in 2019 to boost the mining industry. 'The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we've been trying to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew this deal,' Nathanielsen said. Challenges Despite widespread recognition of Greenland's mineral wealth, attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem. 'For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects. We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So, it's not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of course we welcome it, and there's plenty of opportunity,' Nathanielsen said. Greenland's government is pushing for full independence from Denmark. Supporters hope the island's mineral wealth could one day provide the economic foundation for full statehood. But there's a long way to go, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. 'If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in the international processing going,' Gad told VOA. 'And then, probably you'll have to think very closely about how to make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,' he explained. The risk doesn't always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator, Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting operations. Greenland's 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for much of the year. 'Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some logistical challenges,' Jensen of Lumina said. 'Not all of Greenland is open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way out of.' Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit. 'It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling. And as we all say in mining, 'Time is money.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-trump-spark-a-mineral-gold-rush-in-greenland-/7948233.html	2025-01-23T16:29:02-08:00

Trump signs executive orders on AI, cryptocurrency and issues more pardons	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order related to AI to 'make America the world capital in artificial intelligence,' his aide told reporters in the White House's Oval Office. The order sets a 180-day deadline for an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan to create a policy 'to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.' Trump also told his AI adviser and national security assistant to work to remove policies and regulations put in place by former President Joe Biden. Trump on Monday revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Biden that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security. Biden's order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government, in line with the Defense Production Act, before they were released to the public. Trump also signed an executive order creating a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing a new regulatory framework for digital assets and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency stockpile. The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, and banned the creation of central bank digital currencies that could compete with existing cryptocurrencies. The order sees Trump fulfill a campaign trail pledge to be a 'crypto president and promote the adoption of digital assets.' That is in stark contrast to Biden's regulators that, in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering, cracked down on crypto companies, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and dozens more in federal court, alleging they were flouting U.S. laws. The working group will be made up of the Treasury secretary, attorney general and chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with other agency heads. The group is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The group is also set to 'evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile ... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.' In December, Trump named venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks as the crypto and artificial intelligence czar. He will chair the group, the order said. Finally, Trump signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion protesters on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House. The pardons came a day before anti-abortion protesters were due to descend on Washington for the annual March for Life.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-ai-cryptocurrency-issues-more-pardons-/7948209.html	2025-01-23T15:08:40-08:00

Kidnapped Israeli Russian researcher alive; Baghdad working on release	WASHINGTON — Iraqi officials said that an Israeli Russian researcher, who was kidnapped by an Iraqi militia nearly two years ago, is alive, and that they are working to secure her release. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein on Thursday told an Axios reporter in Davos, Switzerland, that Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton doctoral candidate, is alive and that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani was working on her release, according to Reuters. Tsurkov, 39, was abducted in Baghdad in March 2023 shortly after her arrival in the Iraqi capital. The dual Israeli Russian citizen had traveled to Iraq to conduct fieldwork for her dissertation. Israeli citizens are forbidden from traveling to Iraq, but Tsurkov used her Russian passport to enter the country, according to the Israeli government. The Israeli government said in July 2023 that Tsurkov was being held by Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militia that has ties to the Iraqi government and Iran. In November 2023, Kataib Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, released a proof-of-life video of Tsurkov, the only confirmed evidence of her fate to date. Her sister, Emma Tsurkov, said the family was 'pleased to see the Iraqi government acknowledge what we already know: Elizabeth is alive and being held hostage in Iraq by militias aligned with the Iraqi prime minister. 'At the same time, we are fed up with empty promises from the Iraqi government to get her released with no real follow-through,' she told VOA. Last year, Emma Tsurkov and two other siblings launched an extensive campaign in Washington during an official visit by Sudani. During a panel discussion hosted by the Atlantic Council, Emma Tsurkov interrupted the Iraqi leader, protesting Baghdad’s inaction in securing her sister’s release. In response, Sudani stated that his government had formed a task force to follow up with Tsurkov’s case. The U.S. State Department had confirmed that Tsurkov’s case was raised by former President Joe Biden during his White House meeting with Sudani. Emma Tsurkov said the family 'knows that Elizabeth’s case is already on the radar of the new SPEHA,' referring to Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump’s nominee for special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Boehler must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can formally begin his role. 'We are confident the Trump team will hold the Iraqi government accountable and make Elizabeth’s safe return a real priority and not just a talking point like the last administration,' Emma Tsurkov said. VOA contacted the State Department for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.

Elon Musk and the legacy of moguls in American politics	Business has been intertwined with American politics since before the nation’s founding. And although unelected business leaders play a major role in financing campaigns and policy initiatives, few in recent memory have taken as personal and public a role in politics as Elon Musk. Even before the 2024 election, the South African-born entrepreneur often interacted with the U.S. government via his companies. His electric car manufacturer, Tesla, has received green energy subsidies, while his company Space X holds multiple contracts with NASA and the U.S. military to provide space-launch services, develop vehicles and operate flights. Through SpaceX, Musk also played a key role in U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion by providing Starlink satellite internet terminals to Ukrainian forces. Musk’s involvement in the war became a source of concern after reports emerged that he was directly making decisions regarding the terminals’ use in the field and was in personal contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials. Musk attained an even more notable role in the media through his 2022 purchase of social media platform Twitter, which had become a de facto public square where journalists, companies and government officials made public announcements and engaged in discussion alongside regular users. Renaming the site X, Musk overhauled verification and content moderation policies to combat what he described as left-wing bias, reinstating President Donald Trump’s account as well as multiple accounts that had been banned for hate speech. As the presidential election drew near, Musk used the platform to boost Trump’s policy positions, eventually making campaign appearances alongside him and sitting in on his calls with foreign leaders. Musk’s involvement culminated in the businessman being announced as head of a new advisory commission on government efficiency, named after an internet meme and cryptocurrency that Musk himself had popularized. But while Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics may be unusual compared to his contemporaries, it recalls earlier eras when larger-than-life business leaders exercised great influence over the country’s affairs. J.P. Morgan (1837-1913) Having made his early career on Wall Street, John Pierpont Morgan gained fame by reorganizing the country’s booming railroad industry in the wake of the Civil War. By organizing conferences among railroad companies and consolidating the ones he held shares in, he helped create an integrated rail system, as he would later do with the nation’s steel production. When the economic panic of 1893 saw the U.S. running out of gold reserves, Morgan’s company stepped in to bail out the government, supplying gold in exchange for Treasury bonds. Then in 1907, when a financial panic threatened to collapse the nation’s banks, Morgan was again credited with saving the country by bringing together bank executives and forcing them to agree on a mutual stabilization plan. Morgan is remembered as a serious businessman who prioritized stability over speculation and supported hospitals, museums and universities through his philanthropic efforts. But Morgan’s integration of railroad and steel industries created monopolies that inspired the nation’s earliest antitrust laws. Moreover, the fact that the U.S. government twice had to rely on a private businessman to bail out its finances became a major cause for concern, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve. Henry Ford (1863-1947) Henry Ford is best known for developing the first mass-produced automobile, making what was previously a luxury product affordable for the average consumer. Beyond the road, Ford popularized the assembly line and the 40-hour workweek as well as setting higher wage standards under the reasoning that better-paid and happier workers would be more productive and able to buy the cars they made. Ford believed that industry and consumerism would not only benefit the economy but promote world peace, actively campaigning against war as a waste of productivity. Having failed to prevent U.S. entry into World War I, Ford dutifully supplied the war effort and quieted his activism, but he still ran for U.S. Senate in 1918 — a race he narrowly lost. Yet not all aspects of Ford’s reputation have aged well. The tycoon’s paternalistic and generous approach to his employees went hand-in-hand with his adamant opposition to unionization efforts and worker strikes, which were suppressed by force. His pacifism had a darker side as well. Ford was notably antisemitic and believed that Jewish people had been responsible for World War I as well as multiple ills in American society. After buying the Dearborn Independent newspaper in 1918, Ford used it to publish multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories, stopping only after threats of a boycott against his companies. As part of the America First Committee, Ford campaigned against U.S. entry into World War II and continued to do business with Nazi Germany up until the U.S. declared war in 1941. William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951) As owner of the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Morning Journal, Hearst built a media empire while pioneering a form of sensationalistic reporting that came to be known as 'yellow journalism.' The Journal’s exaggerated reports of Spain’s colonial violence in Cuba inflamed American opinion and increased calls to intervene. When Congress eventually declared war on Spain in 1898, Hearst personally traveled to Cuba to cover the conflict. Hearst’s media operations would later expand to more than two dozen newspapers in multiple cities, as well as magazines and book publishers. After setting his sights on politics, Hearst briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives for New York’s 11th district but narrowly lost subsequent mayoral and gubernatorial bids. Hearst’s papers had published editorials violently denouncing President William McKinley, and he was blamed for incitement upon McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Initially a progressive populist, Hearst shifted toward right-wing isolationism in the wake of World War I and the 1917 Russian Revolution. While denouncing President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal policies as anti-American, Hearst expressed admiration for Hitler and published articles by the German leader. Nevertheless, Hearst supported U.S. entry into World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor, shifting his focus to promoting anti-Asian sentiment and the internment of Japanese Americans. Today, Hearst is remembered as the real-life inspiration for the film 'Citizen Kane,' which was made during his lifetime and which he sought to block from being released. Conclusion Tycoons who shaped American politics in past eras inspired admiration and controversy, their impact becoming clear only in hindsight. It remains to be seen whether Musk’s influence will outlast the Trump administration, and whether other modern-day moguls will follow his example.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-and-the-legacy-of-moguls-in-american-politics/7948108.html	2025-01-23T13:35:08-08:00	
Senate confirms Trump’s choice for CIA director	washington — U.S. lawmakers confirmed a key member of President Donald Trump’s national security team Thursday, voting 74-25 to make John Ratcliffe director of the country’s premier spy agency. The vote came three days after Trump took the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States and three days after a plea from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee for a speedy vote on Ratcliffe’s nomination to lead the CIA. 'Our world is far too dangerous for any delay in having a Senate-confirmed leader in charge of the CIA,' Senators Tom Cotton and Mark Warner said in a statement Monday, after their committee advanced Ratcliffe by a 14-3 margin. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term in office, earned praise from Republican lawmakers following his confirmation hearing last week. 'Under the Biden administration, the intelligence community made some notable misses,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, told fellow lawmakers Tuesday, citing failures to anticipate the rapid collapse of the U.S.-supported Afghan government in 2021 and the incorrect predictions that Russian forces would quickly overrun Ukrainian defenses at the start of the Kremlin’s invasion. 'Mr. Ratcliffe brings the right experience and the right approach to the CIA,' he said. 'The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,' Cotton, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told Ratcliffe at his confirmation hearing last week. 'I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They joined the CIA, after all, not a church choir or a therapy session,' he added. But the confirmation vote was delayed after criticism from some leading Democrats. 'I want the record to show that I strongly oppose the nomination,' Democrat Ron Wyden said Tuesday. 'In 2020, I opposed his confirmation to be director of national intelligence because I believe his partisanship and willingness essentially went to the proposition of doing what would please Donald Trump,' he said. 'Unfortunately, his actions as head of national intelligence only confirmed my concerns.' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that opposition before Thursday’s vote. 'I will respectfully vote no, not because of our political difference, which of course exists, but because I am deeply worried that Mr. Ratcliffe will be unable to stand up to people like Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, who are known to falsify intelligence,' he said. 'There may be no agency more important than the CIA that has to be fact-based. Sometimes, these facts will lead to inconvenient conclusions for his superiors and the president,' he said. 'It’s in those cases where truth, not fiction, not ideology, must prevail, and I have my doubts that Mr. Ratcliffe will be able to hold firm.' Gabbard, a veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and a former Democratic lawmaker, is Trump’s choice to be the next director of national intelligence. Her confirmation hearing has been scheduled for next week, when she will be asked about accusations from both Democrats and some Republicans that she has repeated Russian disinformation and about her 2017 meeting with former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who stands accused of war crimes. Ratcliffe’s opponents have accused him of defying Congress and withholding information in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a killing that U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They also have criticized Ratcliffe, in his role as director of national intelligence, for the September 2020 release of a Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations of nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. But that decision, and others by Ratcliffe to push back against previous U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia had endeavored to help Trump win the 2016 election, is part of what endeared him to the president. Ratcliffe indicated during his confirmation hearing that substantial changes would be in store for the CIA, saying it needed to be more aggressive both in collecting human intelligence and in countering U.S. adversaries. 'We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,' he told lawmakers at the time. 'We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do. 'To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,' Ratcliffe added. 'If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.' That mantra, according to some analysts, has resonated with both Republicans and Democrats. 'There was criticism throughout the hearing that the CIA has gone soft on collecting human intelligence, on stealing foreign adversary secrets,' Tyler McBrien, the managing editor of Lawfare, told VOA. 'A lot of criticisms about how the CIA has failed to predict in the past four years major geopolitical events, including the fall of the Assad regime and even the New Orleans terrorist attack. 'Ratcliffe really is focused on that human intelligence aspect and also a reorientation toward what he sees as the biggest national security threat, which is China,' McBrien said. Ratcliffe has promised lawmakers that under his leadership the CIA will deliver insights free of political bias and that he will not lead a purge of employees based on their perceived political views or perceived loyalty to Trump. He also promised to reinvigorate CIA investigations into the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, calling it an indispensable tool.

Trump promises global businesses lower taxes for products made in US, tariffs if not	U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but warned if they choose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have to pay tariffs to export them to the United States. 'America is back and open for business,' Trump, in a video linkup from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,' Trump said. 'But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term in office. Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the United States 'very, very unfairly' with the extent of regulations it imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc. The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental impact statements for new construction projects, calling them 'things you shouldn't have to do.' Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already the world's biggest economy, 'a manufacturing superpower' and said the government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business regulations for every new one that is imposed. He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to boost the global economy. He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a barrel — is cut, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' Russia uses revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. 'just wants to be treated fairly by other countries.' He said the U.S. wants to have a 'fair relationship' with China, the world's second-biggest economy. 'We don't want to take advantage,' he said of Washington-Beijing relations. 'We just want to have a level playing field.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-promises-global-businesses-lower-taxes-for-products-made-in-us-tariffs-if-not/7947988.html	2025-01-23T12:37:27-08:00

US lawmakers seek to end China's special trade status, import exemption	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would revoke China's preferential trade status with the United States, phase in steep tariffs and end the 'de minimis' exemption for low-value Chinese imports. The bill, introduced by John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, comes after President Donald Trump issued a memo on Monday asking his cabinet to assess legislation on the Permanent Normal Trade Relations designation for Beijing. Congress approved PNTR for China in 2000, paving the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization. But the U.S. has routinely found the large role of the state in China's economy, including hefty government subsidies for strategic industries, to violate the global trade body's rules. Trump, who has railed against China's vast trade surplus with the U.S., has vowed more duties on Chinese goods. Moolenaar's Restoring Trade Fairness Act was co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi and introduced with a companion bill in the Senate. Moolenaar said granting China PNTR had ushered in waves of Chinese imports, depleted U.S. manufacturing and made the U.S. susceptible to economic coercion from its 'foremost adversary.' 'This gamble failed,' Moolenaar said in a statement. 'This legislation will safeguard U.S. national security, enhance supply chain resilience, and bring manufacturing jobs back to America and our allies.' China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The path for the bill to become law was not immediately clear, but Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Lawmakers from both parties say they want to increase U.S. companies' ability to compete with China. Waves of U.S. tariffs by Trump in his first term and by the Biden administration had effectively ended PNTR treatment for China. Nonetheless, the proposed legislation would end annual recertification of the designation and codify minimum 35% tariffs for non-strategic goods and minimum 100% tariffs for strategic goods. The duties would be phased in over five years — 10% in the first year, 25% in the second year, 50% in year four and 100% by year five. The bill would also end de minimis treatment for certain 'covered nations,' including China. Trump has called for changes to the $800 de minimis duty-free exemption for low-value shipments often blamed for illicit imports of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China. Critics of de minimis say it contributes to the United States' trade deficit with China — $279 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-to-end-china-s-special-trade-status-import-exemption/7947991.html	2025-01-23T11:59:41-08:00	
US judge temporarily blocks Trump's order ending birthright citizenship	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON — A U.S. federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional' during the first hearing in a multistate effort challenging the order. The temporary restraining order sought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington was the first to get a hearing before a judge and applies nationally. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and several immigrant rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright and name pregnant women who are afraid their children won't become U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, began the hearing by grilling the administration's attorneys, saying the order 'boggles the mind.' 'This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' Coughenour told Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer. Coughenour said he's been on the bench for more than four decades and couldn't remember seeing another case where the action challenged was so clearly unconstitutional. Shumate said he respectfully disagreed and asked the judge for an opportunity to have a full briefing on the merits of the case, rather than the judge issuing a 14-day restraining order blocking its implementation. Trump's executive order, which he signed on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could affect hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle. The Trump administration argued in papers filed Wednesday that the states don't have grounds to bring a suit against the order and that no damage has yet been done, so temporary relief isn't called for. The administration's attorneys also clarified that the executive order only applies to people born after Feb. 19, when it is to take effect. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas; Canada and Mexico are among them. The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century. Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Trump's order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don't have at least one parent who is a citizen. A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that the case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trump's order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation's first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,' Tong said this week. One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as 'Carmen,' who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status. 'Stripping children of the 'priceless treasure' of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit says. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-s-order-ending-birthright-citizenship/7947939.html	2025-01-23T11:48:53-08:00

UK teenager jailed for at least 52 years for girls' murders	LONDON — A British teenager who murdered three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event was jailed for at least 52 years on Thursday, for an atrocity prosecutors said was so violent it appeared he had tried to decapitate one of the victims. On Monday, Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted carrying out the killings last July in the northern English town of Southport, a crime which was followed by days of nationwide rioting. Rudakubana will likely spend the rest of his life in jail for the murders of Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, who were among 26 children attending the summer vacation event. He also pleaded guilty to 10 charges of attempted murder, as well as to producing the deadly poison ricin and possessing an al-Qaida training manual. Two of his victims suffered 'horrific injuries which ... are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature,' prosecutor Deanna Heer told Liverpool Crown Court. Judge Julian Goose described Rudakubana's actions as 'evil,' saying: 'I am sure that Rudakubana had a settled and determined intention to carry out these offenses and that, had he been able to, he would have killed each and every child, all 26 of them, as well as any adults who got in his way.' The judge sentenced Rudakubana in his absence after he refused to return to court, having twice been removed for interrupting the hearing. Goose said he was not allowed by law to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole as Rudakubana was 17 at the time of his crimes, but added: 'It is likely that he will never be released and that he will be in custody for all his life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-teenager-jailed-for-at-least-52-years-for-girls-murders/7947723.html	2025-01-23T09:06:36-08:00	
Rubio heads to Central America amid Trump's push to reclaim Panama Canal	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to visit Panama and other countries in Central America amid President Donald Trump’s push to reclaim the Panama Canal and Washington’s efforts to curb illegal migration. The trip is expected to mark Rubio’s first foreign visit as secretary of state. U.S. news outlet Politico reported that Rubio’s itinerary includes stops in Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. A State Department spokesperson told VOA, 'We don’t have any travel to announce at this time.' President Trump has said he has not ruled out the possibility of either military or economic measures to achieve his stated goal of bringing the Panama Canal back under U.S. control. Earlier this week, Rubio outlined his foreign policy priorities, including halting the mass entry of undocumented migrants into the United States. 'The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants' to their home countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-central-america-amid-trump-s-push-to-reclaim-panama-canal/7947641.html	2025-01-23T08:32:29-08:00	
Vietnam's media restructuring will lead to more propaganda, critics warn	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Critics warn that Vietnam's ongoing push to restructure the country's media will allow authorities to have tighter control over news outlets and more effectively spread propaganda. The media restructuring started in 2019 when former Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc signed the 'National Press Development and Management Planning until 2025' policy. According to the plan, 180 press organizations will be shut down, and 8,000 reporters and editors will lose their jobs. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA the media restructuring has become more severe under General Secretary To Lam, who took over as leader of the Communist Party after the July 2024 death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. 'There's little doubt that this so-called ‘reform’ will result in the Vietnamese people getting even less real news,' Robertson wrote in an email. 'This is precisely the path one expects an authoritarian like To Lam to take, doubling down on government control of what the people hear and see.' To Lam’s broader ambitions for government reform include consolidating 14 ministries into seven. Under the government’s plan, dubbed Resolution 18, each ministry will be allowed to have one official news publication, further cutting the number of news outlets in the country. The move could cut the number of news outlets in half, some analysts say. The government plans to concentrate resources into six national media conglomerates. The six outlets include Nhan Dan — the newspaper of the Communist Party — as well as the outlets of the Defense Ministry and Public Security Ministry. Vietnam Television will become the sole national television channel, absorbing smaller broadcasters. On Jan. 15, broadcasts for 13 channels operating under Vietnam Multimedia Corporation, or VTC, ended, along with Voice of Vietnam TV and Nhan Dan TV. VTC was the country’s second-most-popular television broadcaster and had been operating for 20 years. One 21-year-old journalism student was working as an intern at VTC in Hanoi when it shut down at midnight on Jan. 15. He said all the staff gathered on the first floor and had a countdown until all the TV monitors were turned off. Afterwards, they had fireworks. He said approximately 1,000 VTC employees lost their jobs that night. 'Everyone was crying,' he said, asking to be referred to as Justin. 'After 20 years working at the station, doing a lot of collaboration, doing a lot of programs, doing a lot of special news, they have been kicked out for no reason. That's how they are feeling.' A regular VTC viewer in northern Vietnam who described herself as a housewife said it's painful to see the broadcast shuttered. 'Honestly, I don't want any channel to close,' she wrote on Facebook in Vietnamese. 'I consider those channels as family members. Losing a channel is like losing a person.' 'Bitter medicine' On Dec. 1, To Lam spoke during a national conference on the implementation of Resolution 18. He stated the restructuring is designed to streamline the political system and remove institutional bottlenecks. 'This is really a difficult issue,' To Lam said. 'It will involve thoughts, feelings, aspirations and affect the interests of a number of individuals and organizations. 'The implementation in many units will certainly encounter difficulties,' the General Secretary said. 'However, we still have to proceed because to have a healthy body, sometimes we have to ‘take bitter medicine.’' Trinh Huu Long, a democracy advocate and co-founder of the Taiwan-based nonprofit Legal Initiatives for Vietnam, said the government is rushing to finalize its media restructuring and the consolidation of government ministries. 'Everyone is working around the clock,' he said. 'They're planning to finish everything in March, when the Congress will hold a special session to rubber stamp this massive restructure.' Nguyen Hong Hai, a senior lecturer at Hanoi's VinUniversity, told VOA that while working in the public sector, he saw the need for reform firsthand. 'There's the fact that there are a lot of employees who are not working, in the real sense, and there's a lot of waste,' he said. 'Every society needs reforms. But the thing is, how to do it effectively?' Justin, the journalism student in Hanoi, supports the government reforms although he said change is happening 'too fast' and without new opportunities for those who lost their livelihoods. That includes his uncle, who worked for VTC for some 20 years. 'We have cried, but we still 100% agree with what the government decided,' he said. 'We just want to comment, ‘Please, if you want to kick me out, give me a new job.’ … Do not change so rapidly so that people will be shocked, like right now, kicked out from the job and with no other proposal for the future.' Pushing propaganda Long said that as Hanoi focuses its resources into six national media conglomerates, authorities will have more power to push Hanoi's agenda. 'The government will invest in a small number of state agencies to make them a lot more effective in propaganda,' Long said. 'The number one function of every state-media outlet is to promote and defend the [Communist] Party. Serving readers is secondary.' In a November 2024 report, Legal Initiatives for Vietnam stated that there are currently 17 independent journalists behind bars in the country, all of whom were jailed within the last five years. While all media outlets in Vietnam undergo government censorship, some outlets are funded by private corporations, although they must receive their licenses from government ministries. Long said these semi-privatized outlets, which have been the most professionalized and provided news which has not entirely aligned with Hanoi and government policy, are being pushed out. 'The quality is going to go south very, very quickly,' he said. Long gave the example of Zing News. In July 2023 the news site was suspended for three months after it was investigated by the Ministry of Information and Communications. The outlet came back after the suspension but was rebranded as Z News and the quality and frequency of its content was greatly downgraded, effectively making the outlet 'irrelevant,' Long said. He said that the outlet was punished for writing articles about Russia's war on Ukraine that created 'pro-Ukraine sentiment among the Vietnamese public.' 'They published a lot of articles about the Ukraine war that fell out of the [Communist] Party's line, which is always to be pro-Russia,' Long said. A researcher of Vietnamese media, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns, told VOA that the digitizing of national media allows it to 'masquerade' propaganda as news. 'I think it's very depressing. … It's going to be uniform news, and it's going to be only from the government's point of view,' the researcher said. 'There's going to be fewer and fewer people dedicated to work as journalists and seeking out the news that matters to the Vietnamese people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-media-restructuring-will-lead-to-more-propaganda-critics-warn/7947621.html	2025-01-23T08:26:04-08:00	
ICC seeks arrest warrants for top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that he is seeking arrest warrants for high-ranking Taliban leaders in Afghanistan accused of crimes against humanity, citing widespread discrimination against the country’s female population. Karim Khan identified the suspects as the Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, saying his action is based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process. 'My Office has concluded that these two Afghan nationals are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women … and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women,' Khan stated. He noted that the persecution has been ongoing since August 2021, when the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Khan said, without elaborating, that his office would soon file additional applications seeking arrests of other senior Taliban members. ICC judges are now required to review the applications before deciding whether to issue an arrest warrant for Akhundzada and Haqqani. Experts anticipate the process could take weeks or even months. 'These applications recognize that Afghan women and girls, as well as the LGBTQI+ community, are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable, and ongoing persecution by the Taliban,' Khan stated. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' added the chief prosecutor. The Hague-based ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on its 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Taliban officials did not immediately offer any response to the ICC announcement. Akhundzada, who governs the country from the southern city of Kandahar, has issued numerous edicts over the past three-and-a-half years, imposing extensive restrictions on Afghan women and girls that the United Nations has condemned as 'gender apartheid.' Girls are banned from pursuing education beyond the sixth grade, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The U.N. and global rights groups have condemned the bans and demanded the Taliban reverse their restrictions on women, saying they are a key sticking point in the Afghan authorities’ pursuit of official recognition for their government in Kabul. The Taliban have vehemently defended their governance, asserting that their policies align with Sharia and Afghan culture. Taliban leaders say all Afghan citizens’ rights are provided for under Islamic law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-seeks-arrest-warrants-for-top-taliban-leaders-in-afghanistan/7947612.html	2025-01-23T07:57:11-08:00

Same-sex marriages in Thailand now legal	Bangkok — Hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples married in Thailand Thursday as the kingdom became the third place in Asia to legalize same-sex unions. The decision carries serious economic potential in that country. The new law came into effect on Thursday, following only Taiwan and Nepal in Asia. It also makes Thailand the first Southeast Asian nation to recognize same-sex marriage, in a region of several Muslim-majority nations where homosexuality is outlawed on religious grounds. Now, in an administrative change that carries major consequences, the word 'spouse' replaces 'husband' and 'wife' in statutes, unlocking access for same-sex couples to practical benefits previously only enjoyed by heterosexual marriages. Those include the ability to adopt children, take out joint mortgages, pass on property after death, benefit from next-of-kin status and receive state benefits - as well as crucial medical rights to give consent on behalf of their partners in an emergency. Across the country, from Krabi in the south to Chiang Mai in the north, couples married in registration ceremonies that ranged from intimate at local government offices to a mass wedding at a downtown shopping mall in Bangkok. Thai national Rittigiat Subma married his Chinese partner, Xichen Lin, in Bang Rak district, Bangkok’s most popular district for marriage. Pride rainbow flags and umbrellas hung above the offices, while a three-piece band provided the soundtrack to the weddings. 'I’m so happy. It’s long overdue,' Rittigiat told VOA. 'My partner and I can now take a loan together to buy a house, we can access other equal benefits and make big medical decisions for one another.' 'I can get a spouse visa after we register our marriage here and move to Australia with him for his work.' Proudly holding the red-bound marriage certificate book, his spouse, Xichen Lin. said the pair - who are both 27 and work for tech firms - knew they wanted to get married within weeks of meeting each other. 'Had this bill not been passed there wouldn’t be a relationship for us, because one of the premises of our relationship is that we’re going to have a future.' With no legal possibilities for gay couples in China where same-sex marriage is illegal, he said Thai law has unlocked that possibility. 'We are able to live a normal life now just like a regular couple; we can tell the others that we are married … we can share assets and represent each other in legal circumstances.' Despite the joy and celebration, there were notes of caution from LGBTQ+ advocates who say their equality efforts continue beyond the same-sex bill. 'The law may take effect today but that doesn’t mean discrimination against LGBTQ+ community has changed overnight,' said Tunyawaj Kamolwongwat, a lawmaker for the progressive People’s Party, and a key driver of the law change. 'There is a long journey ahead of us with other laws needing to catch up … now we have to follow up on an array of issues including pregnancy through assisted reproductive technologies, [and] foreign citizenship for LGBTQ+ partners ...' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has reaped the political dividends from the legal change, which follows years of delayed efforts to get same-sex marriage codified. 'With the power of love by all of you, today Thailand marks a historic day in making the world know that we embrace every kind of love, every gender that is a fundamental part of democracy,' Paetongtarn, now at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said in a prerecorded video message. There are also big hopes for an economic bounce, with companies from insurance and mortgages to hotels keen to cash in on the so-called pink baht. Paetongtarn’s government has put same-sex marriages under the kingdom’s 'soft power' drive - alongside Thai pop music and movies - sensing an economic opportunity from a reputation for openness and hosting weddings and honeymoons in one of the world’s top tourist destinations. A study by travel platform Agoda said that Thailand’s marriage equality legislation is set to deliver an additional 4 million international visitors per year and increase tourism revenue by nearly $2 billion annually – within two years after it is enacted. Thai official data says around 9% of the population - or 4.4 million people - identify as LGBTQ+, representing a domestic marriage market of around $50 million. Dujruedee Thaithumnus, a wedding consultant on the tourist haven of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, said the island was ready for the inflow of couples. 'It will boost the economy of the entire island … from musicians who play at weddings, to make-up artists and flower shops to photographers and hotels. The island is already packed as it is. I can’t imagine after the law change is official.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/same-sex-marriages-in-thailand-now-legal/7947517.html	2025-01-23T07:05:15-08:00	
Emilia Perez' tops Oscar nominations in fire-hit Hollywood	LOS ANGELES — Transgender cartel musical 'Emilia Perez' topped this year's Oscar nominations, earning 13 nods in an announcement on Thursday postponed by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. French director Jacques Audiard's Mexico-set musical, released by Netflix, shattered the record for the most Academy Award nominations for a non-English-language movie. It was followed by epic immigrant saga 'The Brutalist' and show-stopping musical adaptation 'Wicked,' which each picked up 10 nominations. Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Vatican thriller 'Conclave' bagged eight nods apiece. Voting deadlines had to be extended this month, as Los Angeles — the home city of the Academy Awards — was devastated by multiple blazes that have killed more than two dozen people and forced tens of thousands to flee. Nominees were unveiled in subdued circumstances, as a town that typically fixates on the Oscars race was instead fixated on new fires burning north of the city. Even so, the glitzy Oscars ceremony itself is still set for March 2, and the stars and studios who have spent months and millions of dollars campaigning learned if they have made the coveted final shortlists. 'Emilia Perez,' in which a narco boss transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime, picked up nods for best picture, best director and best international film, as well as multiple song, score and sound nods. Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, became the first openly trans acting nominee in best actress, and Zoe Saldana was nominated for best supporting actress. Their more famous co-star, Selena Gomez, who has been criticized for her Spanish-language dialogue, missed out. Even so, the Netflix film easily surpassed the most nominated non-English-language movie ever — a record previously held by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Roma,' each with 10. In best actor, firm favorite Adrien Brody was nominated for 'The Brutalist' along with Timothee Chalamet ('A Complete Unknown'), Ralph Fiennes ('Conclave') and Colman Domingo ('Sing Sing'). But in an unexpected pick sure to ruffle a few feathers in the new White House, the fifth and final spot went to Sebastian Stan, for his unsettling transformation into a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' The movie drew threats of lawsuits from Trump's attorneys, particularly for a scene in which the new U.S. president is shown raping his wife. In arguably the morning's biggest surprise, Jeremy Strong, who plays the youthful Trump's sinister mentor Roy Cohn, was also nominated in his supporting role. He edged out the likes of Denzel Washington ('Gladiator II'). Meanwhile, in an intense race for best actress, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman — who went all-out with their performances in 'Maria' and 'Babygirl,' respectively — missed out entirely. Instead, comeback queen Demi Moore, who charmed the industry with her Golden Globes acceptance speech for body horror-satire 'The Substance,' was nominated and is seen as the favorite. Her rivals include Gascon, 'Anora' star Mikey Madison, 'Wicked' lead Cynthia Erivo and Brazil's Fernanda Torres for 'I'm Still Here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emilia-perez-tops-oscar-nominations-in-fire-hit-hollywood/7947487.html	2025-01-23T07:01:46-08:00

UK watchdog targets Apple, Google mobile ecosystems with new digital market powers	London — Google's Android and Apple's iOS are facing fresh scrutiny from Britain's competition watchdog, which announced investigations Thursday targeting the two tech giants' mobile phone ecosystems under new powers to crack down on digital market abuses. The Competition and Markets Authority said it launched separate investigations to determine whether the mobile ecosystems controlled by Apple and Google should be given 'strategic market status' that would mandate changes in the companies' practices. The watchdog is flexing its newly acquired regulatory muscles again after the new digital market rules took effect at the start of the year. The CMA has already used the new rules, designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies, to open an investigation into Google's search ads business. The new investigations will examine whether Apple or Google's mobile operating systems, app stores and browsers give either company a strategic position in the market. The watchdog said it's interested in the level of competition and any barriers preventing rivals from offering competing products and services. The CMA will also look into whether Apple or Google are favoring their own apps and services, which it said 'often come pre-installed and prominently placed on iOS and Android devices.' Google's YouTube and Apple's Safari browser are two examples of apps that come bundled with Android and iOS, respectively. And it will investigate 'exploitative conduct,' such as whether Apple or Google forces app makers to agree to 'unfair terms and conditions' as condition for distributing apps on their app stores. The regulator has until October to wrap up the investigation. It said it could force either company to, for example, open up access to key functions other apps need to operate on mobile devices. Or it could force them to allow users to download apps outside of their own app stores. Both Google and Apple said the work 'constructively' with the U.K. regulator on the investigation. Google said 'Android's openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps. It's the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system.' The company said it favors 'a way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.' Apple said it 'believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-watchdog-targets-apple-google-mobile-ecosystems-with-new-digital-market-powers/7947387.html	2025-01-23T05:11:10-08:00	
Rubio says US committed to Philippines in call about China's 'dangerous' actions	New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed China's 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea' with his Philippine counterpart on Wednesday and underscored the 'ironclad' U.S. defense commitment to Manila. 'Secretary Rubio conveyed that (China's) behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement on the call with Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo. The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Rubio's call came after he hosted counterparts from Australia, India and Japan in the China-focused 'Quad' forum on Tuesday, the day after President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The four recommitted to working together. Quad members and the Philippines share concerns about China's growing power and analysts said Tuesday's meeting was designed to signal continuity in the Indo-Pacific and that countering Beijing would be a top priority for Trump. In the call with Manalo, Rubio 'underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines' under their Mutual Defense Treaty and discussed ways to advance security cooperation, expand economic ties and deepen regional cooperation, the statement said. China's foreign ministry said its activities in the waters were 'reasonable, lawful and beyond reproach.' Speaking at a regular press conference, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the United States was 'not a party' to the South China Sea dispute and had 'no right to intervene' in maritime issues between China and the Philippines. 'Military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to endorse the illegal claims of the Philippines,' Mao said. The Philippines, a U.S. defense treaty ally, is among the first countries to engage with the new U.S. administration to discuss critical security matters, Manila's defense department said in a statement. Its defense secretary Gilberto Teodoro and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz met at the White House on Thursday to reaffirm the enduring alliance between their two countries. Just ahead of Trump's inauguration, the Philippines and the United States carried out their fifth set of joint maritime exercises in the South China Sea since launching the joint activities in 2023. Security engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces can access, including facilities facing the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. Visiting the Philippines last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said a trilateral initiative to boost cooperation launched by Japan, the U.S. and the Philippines at a summit last year would be strengthened when the new U.S. administration took over in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-says-us-committed-to-philippines-in-call-about-china-s-dangerous-actions-/7947364.html	2025-01-23T04:41:17-08:00	
India open to return of undocumented Indians in the United States	New Delhi — Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said New Delhi is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States. His comments came following a meeting with U.S. foreign secretary Marco Rubio in Washington during which illegal immigration was one of the issues discussed. Saying that New Delhi was firmly opposed to illegal migration, he told reporters that 'We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally, if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been, you know, open to their legitimate return to India.' He said it is a position India takes with every country. Jaishankar was addressing a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, a day after his meeting with Rubio. After taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration and deport those who are in the U.S. illegally. Indians made up the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2022 behind Mexico and El Salvador, according to Pew Research Center. It estimated their number at 725,000. Analysts see India’s proactive stand on facilitating the return of illegal Indian migrants in the U.S. as a move to address a key concern of the Trump administration as New Delhi prepares to navigate more complicated issues, including trade and tariffs. 'Among a range of issues, where there are divergences between India and the U.S., this is one area where India can show it is transparently doing something, allowing it greater space to maneuver in other areas,' according to Harsh Pant, vice president of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'In other areas, such as the economy and trade, it is very difficult to do things which the new Trump administration may want India to do, and it would take time.' Jaishankar said that New Delhi is currently verifying the identities of those eligible for deportation and precise numbers of illegal migrants cannot be determined. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, for which India will verify and start the process of deportation, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Deportations of Indians in the United States who lack proper documentation have been taking place – a group of Indian nationals was repatriated by the U.S. in October, for example. The Indian foreign minister Jaishankar also spoke in support of legal migration channels. 'As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level,' he said at his press conference. The H-1B visa program, which brings skilled foreign workers to the United States, has been a subject of debate in the U.S. in recent years, with some strongly criticizing the program for negatively impacting American workers. Proponents assert those skilled workers benefit U.S. companies and employers. Indians, most of them professionals working in the technology industry, are among the biggest beneficiaries of the visa program. Analyst Pant says India is on a 'stronger wicket' where H-1B visas are concerned. 'On this issue, India has also been getting support from companies in the U.S. So politically, that is a safer issue for India to handle because there is a domestic support base for India,' Pant said. Elon Musk is among those who have expressed strong support for the program. Trump, who had been critical of the program, last month spoke in its favor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-open-to-return-of-undocumented-indians-in-the-united-states/7947323.html	2025-01-23T03:45:03-08:00	
Taliban flog 12 Afghans, including women, for adultery, eloping	Islamabad — Taliban justice officials in Afghanistan said Thursday that 12 people, including two women, had been publicly flogged this week after being tried and charged with adultery, sodomy, eloping, and having 'illicit relations.' The regime’s Supreme Court announced the punishments, saying they were carried out in the southeastern Khost and northern Parwan provinces, with members of the judiciary, administrative staff, and ordinary citizens present as onlookers. Each of the twelve defendants received the maximum of 39 lashes and prison terms ranging from eight months to three years. The top court acknowledged that the sentences were imposed by provincial courts and implemented only after its approval. At least 35 Afghans have been publicly flogged in this month alone, according to the Supreme Court data. Hundreds of men and women have been flogged in packed sports stadiums across Afghanistan, while six people have been publicly executed under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. The United Nations and global human rights organizations have persistently decried the floggings and other forms of corporal punishment as contrary to Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations, demanding the Taliban cease the practice. Taliban leaders, who regained power in 2021, defend their criminal justice system and governance at large, saying they are based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Authorities have banned Afghan girls from pursuing secondary and university-level education and prohibited women from seeking employment in most public and private workplaces. Women must also publicly cover their faces and travel with a male guardian. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. China and the United Arab Emirates have acknowledged a Taliban ambassador without recognizing the Afghan government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-flog-12-afghans-including-women-for-adultery-eloping/7947313.html	2025-01-23T03:35:00-08:00	
Trump designates Yemen's Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organization'	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated Yemen's Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a 'foreign terrorist organization,' the White House said. The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden administration had applied to the Iran-aligned group in response to its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships defending the critical maritime chokepoint. Proponents of the move say it is overdue, though some experts say it could have implications for anyone seen as aiding the Houthis, including some aid organizations. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the White House said in a statement. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target the group's leadership. At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped Trump's terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated the group as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' organization. But his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation. British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and fuel. 'The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and disease that will follow,' Oxfam America's director of peace and security, Scott Paul, said in a statement. David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump's move on Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as one of Iran's leading proxy forces in the Middle East. 'While the redesignation likely won't have a positive impact on the group's behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through blandishment,' Schenker told Reuters. The Trump administration said the U.S. will work with regional partners to eliminate Houthi capabilities, deprive it of resources 'and thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.' The designation will also trigger a broad review of U.N. partners, non-governmental organizations and contractors operating in Yemen, the White House said. 'The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,' the White House said. The Houthis in recent days have signaled they were scaling back attacks in the Red Sea following a multiphase cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-designates-yemen-s-houthis-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization-/7947289.html	2025-01-23T02:28:32-08:00

Israeli military says it killed 2 militants connected to West Bank bus attack	Israel’s military said Thursday it killed two Islamic Jihad militants who were involved in a deadly attack on a bus in the West Bank earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces said its troops killed the militants in the village of Burqin amid an exchange of fire after the militants had barricaded themselves in a building. One Israeli soldier was injured in the attack, the military said. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz praised the operation Thursday and said Israel will continue its operation targeting terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank to ensure it does not become a base for attacks. Israel launched the operation on Tuesday, days after it began a ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank increased after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli counterassault in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed more than 800 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time. Israel’s military says at least 29 Israelis, including soldiers have been killed. The Gaza war began with the Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The U.S. State Department said new Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to help Israeli free the remaining hostages as he spoke by telephone Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Rubio 'congratulated the Prime Minister on Israel’s successes against Hamas and Hezbollah' and highlighted that maintaining 'steadfast support for Israel is a top priority' for the United States under President Donald Trump, according to a statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, said it will release another round of hostages on Saturday. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Shortly after the six-week ceasefire began, Hamas released three hostages while Israeli freed 90 Palestinian prisoners.

Gabon to hold presidential election April 12	LIBREVILLE, GABON — Gabon's transitional government said presidential elections would be held on April 12, a key step to reestablish civilian rule after a coup ended the Bongo dynasty's decades-long reign. Government spokesman Seraphin Akure Davain made the announcement early Thursday following a Cabinet meeting. 'Voting will start at 7 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. in line with current laws,' he said. The oil-rich central African country, which had been under the rule of the Bongo family for 55 years, adopted a new constitution in a November referendum. It provided for a maximum of two seven-year presidential terms, no prime minister and no dynastic transfer of power. On Monday, a new law allowed military officials to stand in elections, subject to certain conditions. Transitional President General Brice Oligui Nguema, who swiftly took over as leader after the August 2023 coup, has made no secret of his ambitions to remain in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-to-hold-presidential-election-april-12/7947252.html	2025-01-23T00:18:35-08:00	
Chad opposition protests final election results won by transitional president’s party	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad's Constitutional Council has ignored opposition calls to set aside results of last month’s parliamentary elections for gross irregularities and fraud, and proclaimed the ruling party of Chad's president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby, the winner. Officials said nominations for senatorial elections to end the transition are open, but the opposition insisted another transitional government should be formed and transparent elections organized to end the three-decade Deby family rule. Officials in Chad said opposition leaders assembled Wednesday in the capital, N'djamena, to protest the election results published Tuesday by the Constitutional Council, the central African nation’s highest court. Clement Sianka, spokesperson of Chad's National Assembly of Democrats, an opposition political party that participated in the Dec. 29 polls, said he took part in the protest because his party is surprised that the council refused to annul the elections he said were marred by fraud, low voter participation and intimidation of civilians Chad's military considered to be opposition supporters. Sianka said that by ordering government troops to chase opposition party representatives from polling stations, Deby, who in December declared himself as field marshal, the highest rank in Chad's military, once more sent a strong message to civilians that he wants to take power at any cost and continue the three-decade rule begun by his father, Idriss Deby Itno. Sianka said fraud was alarming, with ballot boxes confiscated and stuffed by supporters of Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, party in front of helpless civilians. He said the MPS party declared its candidates as winners in towns and villages where civilians obeyed opposition boycott calls and elections did not take place. Sianka spoke on Chad’s state TV on Wednesday. According to the final results published by the country’s Constitutional Council on Tuesday, the MPS won124 seats in the 188-member National Assembly. Sixty-four women were voted in as lawmakers, according to the official results, an increase of 36 women over Chad's last legislative period, which ended in 2011. Officials say financial difficulties have made it impossible for legislative polls to be held since 2011. The opposition said the polls, the first in over a decade, should be set aside because most of Chad's roughly 8.3 million voters heeded opposition calls for a boycott. There were no indications the polls were to be free, fair and transparent as civilians already knew that Deby wanted to confiscate power, Chad's opposition said. However, Chad's Constitutional Council said voter turnout was over 50%, and the elections were peaceful with no major incidents that could affect the outcome of polls. Chad's Political Actors Consultation Group, or GCAP, a coalition of several dozen political parties, on Wednesday said democracy was stifled during Chad's three-year transition period. GCAP said Deby, who took power as a military ruler in 2021, persecutes critical opposition leaders to maintain the rule of his father. Idriss Deby spent three decades in power until he died while fighting rebels in April 2021. GCAP said Deby should hand power to a civilian capable of managing another transition during which transparent elections will be organized for a return to democratic rule. The group did not say who they think will manage the transition are advocating. Chad's opposition also accused the elections management body of rigging elections to favor Deby, who appoints and can fire the elections management body’s officials. Chad's Constitutional Council has neglected calls for an immediate end to the country’s transitional government and the cancellation of the Dec. 29 elections. The council says such calls are intended to bring chaos in Chad. On Wednesday the National Agency for the Management of Elections or ANGE reiterated calls on qualified civilians to prepare their nomination papers before a Jan. 24 deadline and run in the country's first senatorial elections, to be organized in April. Officials say the senatorial election will be the last polls to be organized by the transitional government in its efforts to hand power over to civilian rule. Ahmed Bartchiret, president of ANGE, said ANGE will not accept intimidation by opposition parties that want to disrupt Chad's unity and create chaos. He said ANGE will organize free, fair and transparent elections as it freely organized a constitutional referendum and presidential elections to hand over power to civilian rule as desired by the peace-loving people of Chad. Chad's opposition has always contested the outcome of elections since Deby became transitional president. Deby said he respects the verdict of the ballot and called on civilians to work with democratically elected officials for the development of Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-protests-final-election-results-won-by-transitional-president-s-party/7947242.html	2025-01-23T00:05:32-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile attack hits Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region	Officials in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said Thursday a Russian ballistic missile attack killed at least one person and injured 24 others. Regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram that Russian drones also destroyed an energy facility and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people. In the Mykolaiv region, Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down nine Russian drones. Debris from the drones damaged several houses, Kim said. Ukraine’s military also shot down several drones over the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Trump-Putin U.S. President Donald Trump told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday to end his 'ridiculous war' against Ukraine or the United States would soon impose new 'high levels' of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on any Russian exports to the West. Trump, two days into his second term in the White House, told Putin in a social media post that he was 'not looking to hurt Russia' and that the U.S. 'must never forget' that Russia helped the U.S. win World War II, but that it was time to end Moscow’s nearly three-year invasion of neighboring Ukraine. 'All of that being said,' Trump noted on his Truth Social account, 'I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.' 'If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon,' Trump said he would 'have no other choice' but to impose the taxes, tariffs and sanctions. Under President Joe Biden, who left office on Monday, the United States and its European allies frequently sanctioned key sectors of the Russian economy and oligarch friends of Putin, worsening the country’s economy but failing to stop the war. Trump said, 'Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It’s time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!' There was no immediate response from Putin to Trump’s demands.

South Korea investigators recommend Yoon be charged with insurrection, abuse of power	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators recommended Thursday that impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol be charged with insurrection and abuse of power, as they handed over the results of their probe into his ill-fated declaration of martial law to prosecutors. The official charges against Yoon were 'leading an insurrection and abuse of power,' the Corruption Investigation Office said after a 51-day probe into his Dec. 3 attempt to suspend civilian rule. The CIO said it 'decided to request the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office file charges against the sitting President, Yoon Suk Yeol, in connection with allegations including leading insurrection.' Yoon had 'conspired with the former Minister of National Defense and military commanders on December 3, 2024,' it said. The leader, currently suspended from duties, 'declared martial law with the intent to exclude state authority or disrupt the constitutional order, thereby inciting riots.' Under the South Korean legal system, the case file of the suspect -- identified as 'Yoon Suk Yeol: president' -- will now be handed to prosecutors, who have 11 days to decide whether to charge him, which would lead to a criminal trial. The prosecutors' office has 'complied with the CIO's request for a case transfer,' the investigators said. Yoon was arrested in a dawn raid last week on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be detained in a criminal probe. South Korea was plunged into political chaos by Yoon's botched martial law declaration, which lasted just six hours before lawmakers voted it down. They later impeached him, stripping him of his duties. Since his arrest, Yoon has refused to be questioned by the CIO, which is in charge of the criminal probe. He has declined to cooperate with the probe and 'consistently maintained an uncooperative stance,' Lee Jae-seung, deputy CIO chief, said in briefing to reporters. Yoon's security detail also 'obstructed searches and seizures, including access to secure communication devices like classified phones,' Lee said. The CIO said it had decided, in view of Yoon's efforts to block their investigation, it would be 'more efficient' for prosecutors to handle the case, as they have the authority to indict suspects. His lawyers have repeatedly said the CIO has no authority to investigate insurrection. Yoon's legal team said Thursday that they urged prosecutors to 'conduct an investigation that adheres to legal legitimacy and due process.' 'Abused authority' During the night of Dec. 3, Yoon purportedly ordered troops to storm the National Assembly and prevent lawmakers from voting down his declaration of martial law. The CIO said its probe found that Yoon 'abused his authority by compelling police officers from the National Assembly Guard Unit and martial law forces to perform duties beyond their obligations.' He also 'obstructed the exercise of lawmakers' rights to demand the lifting of martial law,' it added. Yoon has denied instructing top military commanders to 'drag out' lawmakers from parliament to prevent them from voting down his decree. Yoon, who remains head of state, is being held in a detention center. In addition to the criminal probe, he is also facing a Constitutional Court case, where judges will decide whether to uphold his impeachment, which would officially remove him from office. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. Yoon, who attended a court hearing this week, will appear again Thursday when the judges will call witnesses to hear details of how martial law unfolded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-recommend-yoon-be-charged-with-insurrection-abuse-of-power/7947234.html	2025-01-22T23:41:22-08:00	
Earthquakes above magnitude 5 strike Philippines	MANILA, Philippines — Two earthquakes jolted the Philippines several hours apart on Thursday, authorities said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage. A magnitude 5.8 quake occurred off the town of San Francisco in Southern Leyte province in the central region of Visayas at 7:39 a.m, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. A magnitude 5.4 earthquake followed four hours later that hit Siocon town in the southern Mindanao region. The agency had recorded at least 68 aftershocks from the Visayas tremor. There were no immediate reports of injuries from either tremor. San Francisco police chief Barnie Catig said the earthquake in the town was brief but strong. 'Some of the picture frames in our shelves fell off,' Catig said by phone. No one was injured, but at least 18 houses and government buildings had minor damage, Catig said. At least one highway had fissures from the tremor but remained passable, he said. 'We're still conducting a full assessment,' Catig said. Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which is located in the Pacific Ocean's 'Ring of Fire', where volcanic activity and earthquakes frequently occur.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-above-magnitude-5-strike-philippines/7947230.html	2025-01-22T23:13:44-08:00	
2 soldiers dead, 12 wounded in ambush by ex-Philippine rebels	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Former Muslim rebels ambushed government troops assigned to escort U.N. staff visiting the southern Philippines, killing two soldiers and wounding 12 others, the military said Thursday. Wednesday's attack came more than 10 years after the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed a peace agreement with Manila, ending a decades-old armed campaign initially for a separate state and later Muslim self-rule in Asia's bastion of Catholicism. A military statement said the soldiers were 'fired upon by unidentified armed personalities' in Basilan island, triggering a firefight that left two soldiers dead and 12 others wounded. The commander of the army unit, Brigadier General Alvin Luzon, said Thursday MILF gunmen attacked the troops who had been dispatched to 'provide area security' to a United Nations team that was to visit a development project in the former MILF stronghold. The U.N. visit was later aborted due to the firefight, he added. The U.N. country office in the Philippines did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. The peace treaty had led to the creation of a self-rule area in a Muslim-populated region in the southern Philippines, now run by Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, the former MILF chief. However, the process of decommissioning the weapons of thousands of MILF fighters following a lengthy armed campaign that left thousands dead is yet to be completed. Ebrahim said in a statement sent to AFP that the regional Bangsamoro government -- which includes the island province of Basilan -- was 'deeply saddened by the unfortunate encounter' with MILF members. He urged all parties to 'remain calm as we work towards addressing this incident through appropriate channels,' while stressing the regional government 'remains steadfast in its commitment to the full implementation' of the peace treaty. Philippine Army commander Lieutenant General Roy Galido condemned the attack and said his forces are 'working closely with local government units and law enforcement agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of this treacherous act face the full consequences of their actions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldiers-dead-12-wounded-in-ambush-by-ex-philippine-rebels/7947229.html	2025-01-22T23:13:11-08:00	
Analysts: China normalizing its claims to maritime zone shared with South Korea	WASHINGTON — South Korea should increase efforts to prevent China from normalizing its claims to sovereignty over a disputed maritime area in waters the two countries share, analysts say. China has been doing it for decades in the South China Sea, analysts say, where it has been using so-called gray zone tactics to assert its claims over vast stretches of maritime territory — claims contested by several neighboring countries in the area. Recent Chinese activity in the waters it shares with South Korea has prompted analysts' warnings that Beijing is doing the same to Seoul. South Korean officials said earlier this month that China had installed a steel structure in disputed waters west of South Korea, The Chosun Daily in Seoul reported. Using reconnaissance satellites, South Korean intelligence agencies detected the structure last month and estimate that it exceeds 50 meters in width and height, The Chosun Daily said. The structure was spotted in the disputed area known as the Provisional Measures Zone, or PMZ, in the Yellow Sea, which South Korea calls the Western Sea. The zone is where the exclusive economic zones of the two countries overlap. The zone was established in 2001 to manage the overlapping claims to the area. Building any kind of facility and conducting activities unrelated to fishing are banned in the area until the dispute is settled. China installed two similar structures in a nearby area in April and May, prompting protests by South Korea. 'Gray zone strategy' 'It is likely that these recent actions are tied to a gray zone strategy that slowly encroaches on this area in ways that over the long-term reinforces their claims,' said Terence Roehrig, an Asia-Pacific security expert and lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'The goal of a gray zone strategy is to slowly force the target state to accept a new normal in the area. Seoul must ensure that does not happen by continuing to assert its position and insist that the delimitation of these waters be settled through negotiation,' Roehrig continued. 'China views the Yellow Sea as a crucial area for its security and potential gateway into the Chinese heartland. It is likely that eventually, these structures may have some military use,' he added. Gray zone tactics blur the line between what is legal and illegal through paramilitary coercions designed to weaken an adversary over time. China's tactics have included building artificial islands and making incursions, pushing the boundary of what is allowed to project military power and control sea routes. 'The incident demonstrates China is using the same strategy it employed in the South China Sea with South Korea now,' said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute. According to Yaacob, China has used gray tactics to build civilian structures in the South China Sea since the early 1990s. China installed structures in Mischief Reef back then, saying their purpose was to support fishermen, he said. 'We now know Mischief Reef has been converted into a military base on an artificial island,' Yaacob said. China now has a military base on an artificial island it built on Mischief Reef, which is in the Spratly Islands. Mischief Reef is also claimed by multiple countries that protest China's military buildup. Admiral John Aquilino, the former U.S. Indo-Pacific commander, said in 2022 that China seemed to have completed the construction of missile arsenals, aircraft hangers, radar systems and other military facilities in Mischief Reef. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China might want access to 'the mineral rights under the sea and to be able to transit freely in the area so it can control commerce and flow of activities in the area' close to South Korea. Sustained structures in the region could impact naval operations of South Korea and the U.S., he continued. 'It's important that South Korea, in particular, but also the United States, Japan and other allies do not allow China to normalize its activities,' Maxwell added. 'That's what it wants to do — normalize its presence so it can claim it as its sovereign [maritime] territory.' In response to South Korea's protests, China said last year that the structures were for supporting fishing activities. The Yellow Sea is a key fishing site for China. 'It's certainly possible that the structures are used to support fishing activities,' said Tabitha Grace Mallory, a founder and CEO of China Ocean Institute and a University of Washington professor focusing on China's ocean policy. 'The fact that these structures are being built unilaterally in the PMZ is just unnecessarily provocative,' she added. Telling VOA on Tuesday that he is 'not familiar with the situation,' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, 'I would like to point out that China is a responsible country that has always carried out distant-water fishery and marine scientific activities in accordance with laws and regulations.' Exploiting political turmoil Some analysts say China could be taking advantage of Seoul's political situation to install the structure in the disputed waters. The installation coincides with the political chaos stemming from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law. 'China is helping to create the political chaos in South Korea so that it can conduct these activities inside South Korea's economic exclusive zone' and 'act with impunity,' Maxwell said. Others are unsure whether the two incidents are related. 'I don't know if this is explicitly tied to exploiting [South Korea's] political turmoil,' said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution. 'But Beijing may be testing South Korea's political resolve over disputed maritime claims, especially if we anticipate that the Trump administration will press [Seoul] to do more to counter Chinese threats in the Indo-Pacific,' Yeo continued. Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, said Beijing does not want to push South Korea too hard, although it has an opportunity to do so, because 'China has an interest in opening a healthy relationship with South Korea, especially at a time when it thinks it is going to have a more amendable government in place.' Cronin was referring to main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, considered pro-China, having a shot at running for the next presidential election, which could be held in few months if the Constitutional Court rules in favor of Yoon's impeachment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-china-normalizing-its-claims-to-maritime-zone-shared-with-south-korea/7947215.html	2025-01-22T22:18:10-08:00	
Hundreds to wed as Thai same-sex marriage law comes into force	Bangkok — Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot in Thailand on Thursday as it becomes by far the largest nation in Asia to allow equal marriage. A mass LGBTQ+ wedding in the capital, organized by campaign group Bangkok Pride with city authorities, expects hundreds of marriage registrations as the law comes into effect. Transgender woman Ariya 'Jin' Milintanapa, who has waited two decades for this moment, told AFP she was 'psyched.' 'This day is important not just for us, but for our kids as well. Our family will finally become one,' she said. Thailand ranks highly on indexes of LGBTQ+ legal and living conditions, and public attitudes, and Thursday's milestone makes it the first Southeast Asian country to allow equal marriage. The kingdom's same-sex marriage bill was passed in a historic parliamentary vote last June, the third place in Asia to do so after Taiwan and Nepal. The law was ratified by King Maha Vajiralongkorn in October and comes into effect after 120 days. The law on marriage now uses gender-neutral terms in place of 'men,' 'women,' 'husbands' and 'wives,' and also grants adoption and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. More than 30 countries around the world have legalized marriage for all since the Netherlands became the first to allow same-sex unions in 2001. Couples will be able to register at the main mass wedding at Bangkok's central Siam Paragon shopping mall and district offices nationwide from 8 a.m. on Thursday. It marks the culmination of years of campaigning and thwarted attempts to pass equal marriage laws. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said during a celebratory photoshoot last week: 'No matter your gender or who you love, love knows no limits or expectations. Everyone will be protected under the same laws.' Thailand has long had an international reputation for tolerance of the LGBTQ+ community, and opinion polls reported in local media have shown overwhelming public support for equal marriage. However, much of the Buddhist-majority kingdom retains traditional and conservative values and LGBTQ+ people say they still face barriers and discrimination in everyday life. Thai activists have been pushing for same-sex marriage rights for more than a decade, with their advocacy stalled by political turbulence in a country regularly upended by coups and mass street protests. Siritata Ninlapruek, an LGBTQ+ activist, described the journey as a challenging, bittersweet battle. 'I am extremely happy, but my fight for the community continues,' she said. She emphasized the need for gender identity recognition beyond biological sex. 'Whether male, female or non-binary, people should have the right to identify as they wish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-to-wed-as-thai-same-sex-marriage-law-comes-into-force/7947206.html	2025-01-22T21:11:28-08:00	
Researchers: Houthis have advantages in protecting leaders from threatened strikes	WASHINGTON — Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi terror group appears to be well-positioned to shield its leaders from retaliatory strikes recently threatened by Israel, international researchers tell VOA. Israel also faces its own challenges in potentially engaging in long-distance targeting of Houthi leaders, but those researchers say the Israeli threat to Houthi rule is likely to grow in the future. Israel has carried out five long-distance airstrikes on Houthi infrastructure and other targets in Yemen since last July, in retaliation for the Houthis firing hundreds of drones and missiles as part of an Iranian proxy war launched against Israel in October 2023. The Biden administration had labeled the Houthis a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization last January, citing their use of missiles supplied by Iran to attack Red Sea shipping. President Donald Trump, who took office this week, signed an order on Wednesday starting a monthlong process of further penalizing the Houthis with a designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. After Israel’s latest Yemen strike on Jan. 10, Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a videotaped warning to Houthi leaders, saying Israel will 'hunt you down' – repeating a threat that he first made last month to 'decapitate' the Houthi leadership. Houthi leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi issued a defiant videotaped message of his own on Monday, saying his militia will monitor an Israel-Hamas ceasefire that took effect a day earlier in Gaza and 'escalate' conflict with Israel 'if (it) breaches' the deal. The Houthi leader is known for being elusive and issuing videotaped statements from undisclosed locations. Mohammed Albasha, a Yemeni American former journalist and founder of U.S.-based consultancy Basha Report that specializes in Middle East and North Africa risk assessments, told VOA that he has not observed any public meetings involving al-Houthi in Yemen since 2015. That is when a Saudi-led coalition began an offensive to try to oust the Houthis from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the militia stormed into the year before. In a series of interviews for this report, Albasha and other international researchers specializing in Yemen said they suspect that al-Houthi has been hiding for years in the mountains of his clan’s home base of Saada province in northwestern Yemen, along with other senior figures of his militia. 'I don’t think Israeli threats have changed the behavior of Houthi leaders much,' said Wolf-Christian Paes, a researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'Since 2015, they have fought Saudi and Emirati forces who tried to target their leadership, which made them very security conscious,' Paes said. 'Al-Houthi has rarely met U.N. or other foreign visitors in person or given interviews to journalists.' Ely Karmon, a researcher at Israel’s International Institute for Counterterrorism, said Houthi leaders appear to have tightened those precautions in response to recent developments, including Israel’s five strikes on Yemen, dozens of U.S.-led strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since last January, and Israeli attacks on Iranian proxy leaders elsewhere in the region. Karmon noted that 10 days after Israel’s first airstrike in Yemen on July 20, 2024, the Houthis’ patron, Iran, held a swearing-in ceremony for its new president, Massoud Pezeshkian, and al-Houthi did not travel to the Islamic republic to attend. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, another Iranian proxy leader, did travel to the Iranian capital for the inauguration and was assassinated in an Israeli bombing hours after the event. April Longley Alley, a researcher at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said the Houthis also are likely to be skeptical of using transmitting technology anywhere near their top leader. Israel used communications devices to attack Hezbollah on consecutive days in September, first detonating thousands of rigged pagers and then hundreds of rigged walkie-talkies that it surreptitiously delivered to the Lebanese terror group. Ten days after the pager attack, Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on his southern Beirut stronghold, giving the Houthis more cause to bolster the protection of al-Houthi, the researchers said. Beyond the Houthis’ home base in Saada, the militia has a political leadership running an internationally unrecognized authority in Sanaa, called the Supreme Political Council. Albasha, the former journalist, said the council’s prime minister and other ministers are not involved in military matters and operate under the authority of the militia’s senior commanders from Saada and the Houthi clan. The researchers said Houthi political leaders and spokesmen appear regularly in public in Sanaa, but typically in settings with many civilians present, giving those officials a human shield from potential aerial attacks. In the latest such appearance on Wednesday, the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council prime minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, appeared at a government auditorium where several hundred people gathered to commemorate the 2004 killing of Hussein al-Houthi, a brother of the militia’s current leader, by forces of Yemen’s then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But the researchers said the Houthis’ tactics for shielding their leaders from attack also have drawbacks. 'Houthi military leaders are going to be very skeptical of using phones, and that is likely going to make it harder and more time consuming for them to exchange messages between Saada and Sanaa,' Longley Alley said. Ari Heistein, an Israel-based researcher with the Counter Extremism Project, said Houthi military leaders risk losing relevance in running their regime if they disconnect from electronic communications for prolonged periods. 'Running a country of more than 32 million people with serious problems is hard to do from isolation in a remote environment,' Heistein said. The researchers said it is harder for Israel to strike leaders of the Houthis than those of Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups located nearer its borders because Yemen is more than 2,000 kilometers away. That distance requires several hours of flight time for Israeli warplanes to reach their targets, versus minutes for the same warplanes to reach neighboring territories. They said Israel also lacks in Yemen the same kind of human intelligence sources that it established in Lebanon and Palestinian territories before the start of the recent conflict, when it perceived Yemen to be a relatively low threat. Karmon, the counterterrorism researcher, said that if the ceasefire in Gaza holds and the Houthis refrain from firing more projectiles at Israel in the coming weeks and months, he expects Israel to focus on closing what he called a 'huge' intelligence gap in Yemen. He said Israel could utilize long-range drones, satellites, human sources and intelligence-sharing with the U.S. and regional partners to do that. Heistein said Israel likely will use its surprise September attacks on Hezbollah, which were years in the making, as a model for dealing with threats from Yemen. 'If the Houthis quiet down for a while, the next time they begin causing trouble, particularly for Israel and international shipping, Israel probably will have a plan in place to take out their leadership,' Heistein said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/researchers-houthis-have-advantages-in-protecting-leaders-from-threatened-strikes/7947198.html	2025-01-22T20:40:03-08:00

New wildfire erupts in Southern California	A new wildfire erupted Wednesday in Southern California, scorching more than 39 square kilometers of trees and brush in the mountains north of Los Angeles. The Hughes Fire is the latest wildfire to erupt in parched Southern California. It is burning near Lake Castaic, a recreation area about 65 kilometers from the Eaton and Palisades fires that are continuing to burn in the region for a third week. The fire, less than 1 square kilometer when first reported, quickly grew to 20 square kilometers with the aid of the Santa Ana winds, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. It was later reported to be 39 square kilometers in size. 'This fire had a robust response today, and as you can see behind us, the responders are doing great work to try to contain this fire,' Joe Tyler, director of Cal Fire, said. 'Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet.' Winds were gusting at 67 kph Wednesday afternoon and expected to increase to 96 kph in the evening and throughout Thursday, the National Weather Service posted on X. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that 31,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 23,000 were under evacuation warnings. Kayla Amara drove to a Castaic neighborhood to retrieve items from a friend’s home. As she was packing, she grabbed a hose and began watering down the property. 'I hope there's a house here to return to,' Amara said as police cars raced through the streets and flames engulfed trees in the distance. Before the Hughes Fire, firefighters and Southern California residents were bracing for the possibility of more wildfires fueled by the strong dry winds. Rain is forecast, but meteorologists have warned it would not be enough to end the fires. Forecasters predict a 60% to 80% chance of rain in the region beginning Saturday, with rainfall totals in most areas not exceeding 0.8 centimeters. The National Weather Service said dangerous fire conditions would persist in the region through Thursday or Friday. Cal Fire spokesman David Acuna said officials are concerned that the Palisades and Eaton fires could break their containment lines. The chance of thunderstorms bringing heavier rainfall has raised fears of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by two weeks of wildfires. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans. 'This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,' the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system. In addition, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved emergency measures facilitating the installation of flood control infrastructure and the removal of sediment in the burned areas. Residents are being encouraged to be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice with their prepared emergency evacuation kits. They are also being encouraged to look at the city’s website to learn how to protect themselves from ash in the air that can include heavy metals, arsenic and other harmful substances, according to L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles this week. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-wildfire-erupts-in-southern-california-/7947166.html	2025-01-22T19:09:37-08:00

Europe posts record year for clean energy	A record 47% of the European Union's electricity now comes from solar and other renewables, a report Thursday said, in yet another sign of the growing gap between the bloc's push for clean energy and the new U.S. administration's pursuit of more fossil fuels. Nearly three-quarters of the EU's electricity doesn't emit planet-warming gases into the air — with another 24% of electricity in the bloc coming from nuclear power, a report released by the climate energy think tank Ember found. This is far higher than in countries like the United States and China, where nearly two-thirds of their energy is still produced from carbon-polluting fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Experts say they're encouraged by Europe's fossil fuel reductions, particularly as the U.S. looks set to increase its emissions as its new president pledges cheaper gas prices, has halted leases for wind projects and pledged to revoke Biden-era incentives for electric vehicles. 'Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,' said Chris Rosslowe, an energy expert at Ember. In 2024, solar power generated 11% of EU electricity, overtaking coal which fell below 10% for the first time. Clean wind power generated more electricity than gas for the second year in a row. 2024 data wasn't available for all countries. Ember's data for the world's largest generators of electricity for 2023 show Brazil with the largest share of its electricity from renewables, almost 89%, with much of that coming from hydroelectric power. Canada had about 66.5%, China 30.6%, France 26.5%, the U.S. 22.7% and India 19.5%. One reason for Europe's clean power transition moving at pace is the European Green Deal, an ambitious policy passed in 2019 that paved the way for climate laws to be updated. As a result of the deal, the EU made their targets more ambitious, aiming to cut 55% of the region's emissions by the end of the decade. The policy also aims to make Europe climate neutral — reducing the amount of additional emissions in the air to practically zero — by 2050. Hundreds of regulations and directives in European countries to incentivize investment in clean energy and reduce carbon pollution have been passed or are in the process of being ratified across Europe. 'At the start of the Deal, renewables were a third and fossil fuels accounted for 39% of Europe's electricity,' Rosslowe said. 'Now fossils generate only 29% and wind and solar have been driving the clean energy transition.' The amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy has remained relatively stable in the bloc. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also spurred the move to clean energy in Europe. Gas prices skyrocketed — with much of Europe's gas coming from Russia becoming unviable — forcing countries to look for cheaper, cleaner alternatives. Portugal, Netherlands and Estonia witnessed the highest increase in clean power in the last five years. The transition to clean power helped Europe avoid more than $61 billion worth of fossil fuel imports for generating electricity since 2019. 'This is sending a clear message that their energy needs are going to be met through clean power, not gas imports,' said Pieter de Pous, a Brussels-based energy analyst at European think tank E3G. De Pous said the EU's origins were 'as a community of coal and steel because those industries were so important,' but it is now rapidly becoming a 'community of solar and wind power, batteries and smart technologies.' Nuclear growth in the bloc, meanwhile, has slowed. Across the European Union, retirements of nuclear plants have outpaced new construction since around the mid-2000s, according to Global Energy Monitor. As President Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement aimed at curbing warming and is pursuing a 'drill, baby, drill' energy policy, Rosslowe said the EU's leadership in clean power becomes all the more important. 'It's about increasing European energy independence, and it's about showing this climate leadership,' he said. On Tuesday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: 'Europe will stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-posts-record-year-for-clean-energy/7947111.html	2025-01-22T17:14:43-08:00	
Few alternatives for UN funding as US withdraws support	Following President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will withdraw from the World Health Organization, the United States is expected to reduce funding to other U.N. agencies.

US House passes immigrant detention bill	WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that requires the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes, marking the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. Passage of the Laken Riley Act, which was named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, shows just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump's election victory. Immigration policy has often been one of the most entrenched issues in Congress, but a crucial faction of 46 politically vulnerable Democrats joined Republicans to lift the strict proposal to passage on a 263-156 vote tally. 'For decades, it has been almost impossible for our government to agree on solutions for the problems at our border and within our country,' said Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. She called the legislation 'perhaps the most significant immigration enforcement bill' to be passed by Congress in nearly three decades. Still, the bill would require a massive ramp up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's capabilities, but it does not include any new funding. Meanwhile, Trump has launched a slew of executive orders intended to seal off the U.S. border with Mexico to immigration and ultimately deport millions of migrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump also canceled refugee resettlement, and his administration has signaled that it intends to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies. Republican congressional leaders have made it clear they intend to follow suit. Their toughest challenge, however, will be finding a way to approve the funding to implement Trump's hardline plans. 'What he's doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our legislative agenda,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans initially passed the legislation last year with support from 37 Democrats. It then languished in the Democratic-controlled Senate. This year, Republicans, now with control of both congressional chambers, have made it their top priority. When it came before the Senate, 12 Democrats voted in favor of passage, and when the House voted on a version of the bill earlier this month, 48 Democrats supported it. 'While the bill is not perfect, it sends a clear message that we think that criminals should be deported,' said Representative Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat who has called on his party to support tougher immigration enforcement. Under the legislation, federal authorities would be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting. The scope of the proposal was widened in the Senate to also include those accused of assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone. The bill also gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the federal government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions. That gives states new power in setting immigration policy at a time when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Ultimately, even the Trump administration is likely to struggle to implement the new requirements unless Congress follows up later this year with funding. Republicans are strategizing how to push their priorities through Congress using a party-line process known as budget reconciliation. They have put the cost of funding Trump's border and deportation priorities at roughly $100 billion. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated the Laken Riley Act would cost $26.9 billion in the first year to implement, including an increase of 110,000 ICE detention beds. Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill as proof that it is a piecemeal approach that would do little to fix problems in the immigration system and saddle federal authorities with new requirements. 'The bill's authors claimed it's going to result in the arrest and detention of serious criminals, but it will not do that because it's a totally unfunded mandate,' said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Others raised concerns that the bill would strip due process rights for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for Unaccompanied Minors program. Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said that federal authorities would now be forced to prioritize detention of migrants arrested for low-level crimes like shoplifting, rather than those who commit violent felonies. On the whole, there is no evidence that immigrants are more prone to violent crime. Several studies have found immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S. Groups that advocate for restrictive immigration policies dispute or dismiss those findings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-passes-immigrant-detention-bill/7947071.html	2025-01-22T16:53:26-08:00	
Beijing's lack of clarity about Rubio sanctions sparks speculation in China	washington — Beijing’s lack of clarity about whether it will lift sanctions previously placed on Marco Rubio — the new U.S. secretary of state and a China hawk — has sparked speculation on Chinese social media about whether Rubio will become the first American diplomat in his position who can’t visit China. On Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, sitting atop the trending chart Tuesday night was the question, 'Will China remove sanctions on the new U.S. Secretary of State?' On Weibo, China’s microblogging site similar to X, netizens wonder if Rubio will become the first U.S. secretary of state who won’t be able to come to China. 'This guy has been barred from entering China, let alone visiting China,' one Weibo user commented. 'It’s now a question how he will be able to deal with China.' Tough on China Rubio, the first Cabinet member of the second Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, was sworn in Tuesday. He was one of the toughest congressional lawmakers on China during his 14-year tenure as a senator. Rubio introduced bills, made statements and worked with rights groups that were highly critical of China’s human rights record and growing influence around the world. A Chinese state media article once called him 'one of America's most radical anti-China politicians.' In 2020, within a month, the Chinese government sanctioned Rubio twice. The first was announced in July of that year as part of the retaliation against the U.S. government’s sanctions against a Chinese government department and four officials in Xinjiang for human rights violations alleged to have taken place in the region. The second one was announced in August after Washington sanctioned 11 Chinese and Hong Kong officials. 'I don’t want to be paranoid, but I am starting to think they don’t like me,' Rubio tweeted sarcastically back then after learning about the sanctions. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio reaffirmed his position on China, asserting that China remains the 'biggest threat' to the United States in the 21st century. 'If we don’t change course, we are going to live in the world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis from our security to our health will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not,' he said during the hearing. On China’s heavily censored internet, most of the comments on his swearing-in have been negative. In a proposed Cabinet lineup that includes candidates who are controversial, Rubio stands out as one with bipartisan support. He received a unanimous 99 confirmation votes. Experts say that how Rubio approaches China will depend largely on President Donald Trump. 'Rubio has a long history of working on China. But everyone in the Cabinet is loyal to Trump. I do think Trump will be the ultimate decision maker on China,' Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia Program and director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, told VOA Mandarin. 'Any China policy will be a balance of issues to reach what Trump defines as American national interests. Hawkish views and friendly views will both be a part of the deal,' she said. Necessary to 'maintain contact' In his new role, Rubio has put Beijing in a peculiar position. The Chinese government has not publicly sent a clear signal regarding questions about whether it will lift sanctions on him to allow him to visit. When asked if China would drop the sanctions, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Tuesday at the daily press conference, 'China will firmly defend national interests. In the meantime, it's necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials to maintain contact in an appropriate way.' Recent online speculation about Rubio has evolved since social media users noticed the Chinese government ostensibly changed its translation of Rubio’s name. Claims circulated that Beijing changed the translation so that it could lift sanctions on Rubio without looking embarrassed, because now China can say the sanctions were aimed at a different person than Rubio. But the so-called new translation isn’t new at all. The first translation has been the most widely used for Rubio in Chinese government documents and media. However, as early as 2019, People’s Daily, Beijing’s flagship state media outlet and a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, used the second translation to refer to Rubio in an attack article. Transcripts from China’s foreign ministry also show that when the two sanctions on him were unveiled in 2020, Rubio was referred to by a third variation of his name. The speculation garnered so much attention that Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, was asked about it on Wednesday at a press conference. 'I am not yet aware of what you mentioned,' she said.

Gangs could overrun Haiti capital if aid falls short, UN chief says	United Nations — Haiti's capital could become overrun by criminal gangs if the international community does not step up aid to a United Nations-backed security mission there, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned in a report Wednesday. More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the Kenya-led international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the 'catastrophic' collapse of Haiti's security institutions and 'could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area' of Port-au-Prince. The U.N. secretary-general lamented that the mission is 'still not deployed to full strength,' limiting its capacity to support the Haitian national police. Haiti's Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, said that the country faced 'major difficulties' that threaten not just the population but also 'the very survival of the state.' The Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti's authorities in their fight against gang violence. But since then, just under 800 of the 2,500 police officers hoped for have been deployed. More than 5,601 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the U.N. said. In the report, Guterres said setbacks in Haiti's political process have 'contributed to a climate in which these atrocities have become possible.' Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges. The U.N. also recorded 315 lynchings of people allegedly affiliated with gangs as well as 281 cases of alleged summary executions by police. More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year ago. The Caribbean nation has suffered from decades of instability, but the situation escalated last February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Unpopular and unelected, Henry stepped down in April, his resignation eventually giving way to a transitional government, which had by November fired its interim prime minister and replaced him with current Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The U.N. Special Representative in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, criticized the 'increasing fragmentation' of the temporary council. 'While there is progress on the political front and reason to be timidly hopeful, the transition framework remains fragile,' she told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. Salvador said the humanitarian situation had reached 'alarming levels,' saying that over six million people -- nearly half the population -- required humanitarian assistance. The United States had, under former President Joe Biden, backed a request by Haitian authorities to transform the security mission into a U.N. peacekeeping force, but faced opposition from China and Russia. So far, the mission has had limited impact on the frequency of attacks by armed groups, who are accused of committing numerous murders, rapes and kidnappings for ransom. The attacks have also targeted key buildings and infrastructure, which forced the closure of the capital's airport to commercial flights in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-could-overrun-haiti-capital-if-aid-falls-short-un-chief-says/7947093.html	2025-01-22T16:47:31-08:00	
Trump signals aggressive stance as US races China in AI development	Before he had been in office for 48 hours, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal that to outpace China, his administration will be pursuing an aggressive agenda when it comes to pushing the United States forward on the development of artificial intelligence and the infrastructure that powers it. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order signed in 2023 by former President Joe Biden that sought to place some guardrails around the development of more and more powerful generative AI tools and to create other protections for privacy, civil rights and national security. The following day, Trump met with the leaders of several leading technology firms, including Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle; and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, to announce a $500 billion private sector investment in AI infrastructure known as Stargate. 'Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in AI, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers,' Trump said in a media event at the White House on Tuesday. Specifically, Stargate will invest in the creation of as many as 10 huge data centers in the United States that will provide the computing for artificial intelligence systems. The first data center is already under construction in Texas. The massive private sector investment will create up to 100,000 U.S. jobs, the executives said. Keeping AI in the US 'What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,' Trump said. 'China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we're making it available. I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency. We have to get this stuff built.' The assembled tech leaders took the opportunity to praise the new president. 'I think this will be the most important project of this era,' Altman said. 'We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.' Janet Egan, a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said that all the signals Trump is sending indicate he is serious about maintaining the United States’ current advantages in the development of advanced AI. 'I think this shows that he's going to have a really clear mind as to how to partner closely with the private sector to enable them to speed up and run fast,' Egan said. 'We've also seen him take direct action on some of the bottlenecks that are impeding the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S., and a particular focus is energy.' OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has relied on Microsoft data centers for its computing. The firm reportedly discussed with the Biden administration the regulatory hurdles of planning and permitting when building data centers. In a policy paper released earlier this month, OpenAI cited the competition with China, laying out its policy proposals to 'extending America’s global leadership in AI innovation.' 'Chips, data, energy and talent are the keys to winning on AI — and this is a race America can and must win,' the paper said. 'There’s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn’t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects — strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence.' Patrick Hedger, director of policy at NetChoice, a technology trade association, told VOA that the Stargate announcement 'immediately signaled to me that private capital is more than willing to come off the sidelines these days with the new Trump administration.' As part of his flurry of executive actions on Monday, Trump eliminated several preexisting executive orders placing limits on fossil fuel extraction and power generation. In the White House event on Monday, Trump also noted that AI data centers consume vast amounts of electricity and said he would be clearing the way for Stargate and other private companies to invest in new energy generation projects. China competition While Trump eliminated many of Biden’s executive orders immediately on Monday, he does not appear to have taken action against some of the former president’s other AI-related initiatives. Last year, Biden took several steps to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge technology related to AI, specifically, restricting the ability of companies that sell advanced semiconductors and the machinery used to produce them to Chinese firms. On that issue, Egan said, Trump and Biden appear to be on the same page. 'I think it's important to also note the continuity in how Trump's approaching AI,' she said. 'He, too, sees it as a national security risk and national security imperative. ... So, I think we should expect to see this run-fast approach to AI complemented by continued efforts to understand and manage emerging risks. Particularly cyber, nuclear, biological risks, as well as a more muscular approach to export controls and enforcement.' Speed and safety Louis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI and a prominent figure in the field for decades, told VOA he thinks there is a bipartisan consensus that AI needs to be developed speedily but also responsibly. 'At the highest level, the accelerating risks around frontier AI is not a partisan issue,' he wrote in an email exchange. 'Both parties realize that significant safeguards will be needed as AI gets increasingly intelligent and flexible, especially as autonomous AI agents get released at large scale.' Rosenberg said the most significant question is how the U.S. can remain the global leader in AI development while making sure the systems that are deployed are safe and reliable. 'I suspect the Trump administration will address AI risks by deploying its own targeted policies that are not as broad as the Biden executive order was but can address real threats much faster,' he wrote. 'The Biden executive order was very useful in raising the alarm about AI, but from a practical perspective it did not provide meaningful protections from the important emerging risks. 'Ultimately we need to find a way to move fast on AI development and move fast on AI protection. We need speed on both fronts,' Rosenberg said.

Trump escalates campaign against diversity, threatens private sector probes	U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his campaign against diversity programs on Tuesday by pressuring the private sector to join the initiative and telling government employees in offices administering such programs they would be placed on paid leave. On his first day in office, Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people and other traditionally underrepresented groups. Civil rights advocates have argued that such programs are necessary to address long-standing inequities and structural racism. Trump and his supporters say DEI programs end up unfairly discriminating against other Americans and weaken the importance of candidates' merit in job hiring or promotion. In an executive order issued on Tuesday, Trump revoked executive orders dating as far back as 1965 on environmental actions, equal employment opportunities and encouragement to federal contractors to achieve workforce balancing on race, gender and religion. The 1965 order that was revoked was signed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to protect the rights of workers employed by federal contractors and ensure they remained free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin, according to the Labor Department. The Trump executive order seeks to dissuade private companies that receive government contracts from using DEI programs and hiring on the basis of race and sex — what the order called 'illegal DEI discrimination and preferences' — and asks government agencies to identify private companies that might be subject to civil investigation. 'As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,' the order said. Full details on how the Trump administration would enforce 'civil compliance investigations' were not immediately available. The order issued on Tuesday stipulates that federal and private-sector employment preferences for military veterans could continue. The executive order was celebrated by conservative activists and Republican leaders. It was also met with condemnation from civil rights leaders who are strategizing how to respond to Trump's actions. Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, formally announced Wednesday the organization and its partners plan to identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning DEI pledges. Reuters first reported the coordinated action ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Basil Smikle Jr., a political strategist and policy adviser, said he was troubled by the Trump administration's assertion that diversity programs were 'diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work and determination' because it suggested women and people of color lacked merit or qualifications. 'There's this clear effort to hinder, if not erode, the political and economic power of people of color and women,' Smikle said. 'What it does is opens up the door for more cronyism,' he said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to address criticism from civil rights advocates. Separately, the Trump administration instructed U.S. federal government departments and agencies to dismantle all DEI programs, advising employees of such programs that they would be immediately placed on paid leave. The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programs will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the Office of Personnel Management said in a memorandum. The Tuesday memo also included a template for agency heads to use, encouraging federal employees to report alleged attempts by 'some in government to disguise' continued use of DEI programs and initiatives 'by using coded or imprecise language.' A directive, using nearly identical wording, was distributed Wednesday to staff at various federal agencies and departments, including the State Department, according to a memo viewed by Reuters. Trump also signed a memorandum on Tuesday that ends a Biden administration initiative to promote diversity in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ordering the FAA administrator to immediately stop DEI hiring programs, the White House said. Trump ordered the FAA to conduct a safety review that would replace any employees who fail to demonstrate their competence. 'President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence,' the White House said in a fact sheet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-escalates-campaign-against-diversity-threatens-private-sector-probes-/7946801.html	2025-01-22T15:20:23-08:00	
Austin Tice's mother travels to Syria to search for missing son	WASHINGTON/DAMASCUS, SYRIA — At a recent press conference in the Four Seasons Hotel in Syria's capital, Damascus, Debra Tice made clear that she would never give up searching for her son, Austin. A former U.S. Marine-turned-journalist, Austin Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Syria in 2012. Little has been heard or seen of him since, but he is believed to have been held in Damascus. After the Bashar al-Assad government fell in December, U.S. officials made a few short visits to Syria, but Tice's family said they had expected more. Debra said she had hoped the U.S. government would send an official search team, but she wasn't shocked that they didn't. 'You can't even believe it. It's heartbreaking,' she said. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit and Liam Scott: In the weeks after the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — known as HTS — overthrew the Assad government, hundreds of people were released from prisons run by the former government. Scenes of families reuniting had raised hope among the Tice family. Just days before Assad fell, the family had convened in Washington to say they had received recent evidence confirming Tice was alive. At the press conference on Monday, Debra said that she feels solidarity with the many Syrians who have had a family member disappear. These families 'understand the pain that we carry every day, that our families carry, that the nieces and nephews that have never met their uncles carry,' she said. 'For all the mothers whose sons were disappeared in these dungeons, our hearts are joined,' she said. When Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy for the Biden and first Trump administration, visited Damascus in late December, he told reporters that U.S. officials weren't able to be on the ground for extended periods of time to search for Tice. Trump's new nominee for the hostage envoy position is Adam Boehler, whose confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit: On the ground in Syria, the Washington-based nonprofit Hostage Aid Worldwide has been leading efforts to locate Tice. Soon after Assad fell, the team began searching former prisons and buildings, including one that the group's president, Nizar Zakka, described as a secret detention center. The facility was dark and grimy. Like in previous prisons they inspected, they found documents, but no people. 'We are learning more and more about how the prison systems operate in Syria, how it was operating, how it was moving, who managed what,' Zakka told VOA after a search. 'It's going to take time to find Austin.' In December, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing its award to $10 million for information about Tice's whereabouts. 'I understand the State Department, that they're outside of Syria and they want to feel like they're doing something,' Zakka said. But the increased reward has led to an increase in tips with unhelpful information, he said. A State Department spokesperson told VOA that efforts to find Tice remain under way. 'We are working to get U.S. officials into Damascus for additional trips to help direct the search and will do so as soon as we confirm the conditions are safe and local authorities can accommodate the visit,' the spokesperson said in a Thursday statement. Advocates say it feels as if the search for Tice has fallen on civil society groups, rather than the U.S. government. 'It definitely feels like that — that they're standing back at this time,' according to Bill McCarren, the executive director at the National Press Club's Press Freedom Center in Washington. 'There does need to be a more sustained effort,' said McCarren, who has worked on Tice's case for years. In Damascus, Tice's mother said she was hopeful that the new Trump administration would help secure her son's release. 'I have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,' she said. 'His people have already reached out to me.' While visiting the Syrian capital, she also met with Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. 'It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined to bring home my son,' she said. But for Zakka of Hostage Aid Worldwide, the Syrian transitional government is also making it harder for his organization to search for Tice. Soon after Assad fell, Zakka said his group had a lot of freedom. But now, 'there's more restrictions every day,' Zakka said. 'It's getting difficult.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-tice-s-mother-travels-to-syria-to-search-for-missing-son/7946775.html	2025-01-22T15:02:10-08:00	
Russia's Arctic militarization behind Trump's focus on Greenland	Nuuk, Greenland — A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square kilometers. Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its security. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using economic or military force. Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that U.S. control was necessary for 'international security' because, he explained, 'You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can't maintain it.' Russian missiles The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'There's no doubt that it's geostrategically important in defending the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,' Jacobsen told VOA. 'The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the North Pole, via Greenland.' Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance systems. Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the region. China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic. Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice. 'There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to increase their capacity,' Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal Danish Defense College, told VOA. Denmark’s defense Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols. Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a 'double-digit billion amount' in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5 billion. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' he told reporters on Jan. 9. 'We will hopefully create an investment package where we will strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and also for some new capacities to be put into place.' Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward 'meeting American demands for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,' Jacobsen said. US Space base The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II, when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile warning, defense and space surveillance systems. 'The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. 'And the big question is then whether the U.S. wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of military operations in that area.' That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations. 'The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word 'control' that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,' he added. 'What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that territory?' US-Danish relations At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being, U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial. Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland. That could change under the new president. For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'There's an important element which is about his personality, which he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried out,' Jacobsen said. 'In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-arctic-militarization-behind-trump-s-focus-on-greenland/7946621.html	2025-01-22T14:31:53-08:00	
Georgia's Zourabichvili says US shouldn't back government that is result of 'rigged elections'	washington — Last December, Georgia’s parliament chose Mikheil Kavelashvili, a close ally of ruling Georgian Dream party founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, as the country’s new president. He replaced Salome Zourabichvili, who had won the presidency in 2018 in a popular vote. Zourabichvili was the country’s fifth president. Opposition parties and Zourabichvili contend that the country’s October 2024 parliamentary elections, which Georgian Dream officially won with 54.09% of the vote, were rigged, and that therefore neither Georgian Dream’s victory nor Kavelashvili’s replacement of Zourabichvili as president was legitimate. The opposition parties have refused to enter parliament and work with Georgian Dream members and are demanding new elections. Zourabichvili was in Washington to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump at the invitation of Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina. While in the U.S. capital, she spoke with Voice of America. The following transcript of that interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: VOA: Thank you for being here at VOA. We know that you attended the inauguration of the 47th president of the United States but also had a chance to meet with members of President Trump’s Cabinet. What was your main message during those meetings? Salome Zourabichvili, former president of Georgia: Well, those … were more social encounters before the inauguration and before the confirmation of those Cabinet members. I met them during different receptions and at [an inaugural] ball. So it was not a place for [a] formal meeting [or] for relaying formal messages. It's very important that contact was established. My short message was that Georgia [is] at a very crucial turning point today, in a region that is very important for the United States and for the United States’ interests, and so there should be immediate attention for what is happening in Georgia, in the Caucasus, in the Black Sea, from the new administration. VOA: You often say that Georgia needs the U.S., but the U.S. also needs Georgia. Why should Georgia be important for the United States, and what role could Georgia play in the South Caucasus [and] the wider region? Zourabichvili: First of all, because the Russians know that more than anybody else: They always said historically that whoever controls Tbilisi … controls the Caucasus. And that is even more important today, at a time when this region is becoming very important for control of the Black Sea. ... The ports of the Black Sea are very important. And it's not a coincidence that Russia started the war against Ukraine also for control of that part of the Black Sea coast, starting with Crimea in 2014. And it's no coincidence that the hybrid war Russia … has started with the elections in Georgia, also with the elections in Romania, and to rig the elections, in a very different manner, in Moldova – so those three countries, if you look at the map, are countries of the Black Sea. So the strategy of Russia is very clear. Hence the strategy of the United States should be [a] continuation of what it has been over the years, which was to consolidate Georgia … [as] a stronghold of democracy. [The] Georgian army would not exist were it not for American support. So I think that shows that this was not just for sympathy of, but because there was a serious, real American interest in supporting Georgia. And I'm confident that these interests are still there and even more today than maybe in the past. VOA: You were invited to attend the inauguration by Congressman Joe Wilson, one of the authors in the U.S House of Representatives of the MEGOBARI Act [aimed at bolstering democracy and countering Russian influence in Georgia], and the Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act [prohibiting the U.S. from recognizing the Ivanishvili regime and recognizing Zourabichvili as Georgia’s legitimate president]. Could you explain why you think it is so important for the U.S. government not to recognize the current Georgian government? Zourabichvili: I think it is not possible for a country like the United States to recognize a government that is the result of rigged elections and anti-constitutional acts … a regime in which no independent institution is left; all the institutions are just nominated by one party and one-man rule. That is really destroying everything that the United States has been doing in this country. Building institutions — not only the army; it's all the institutions — support for reform of the justice system, creation of the anti-corruption system and all of that, which is really the work of more than 30 years since the independence of Georgia. What is happening today is really destroying all of that. VOA: You, the opposition and part of Georgian people are asking for new elections. Is that the main demand at this moment? Zourabichvili: I'm still hoping that the de facto leaders [of Georgia] would recognize that stability of the country is the most important thing and would come to terms with helping the country by [holding] new elections, through some compromise with the opposition. But as time goes by, there's probably less and less hope that they would come to such a sensible solution. And what will then happen most probably is that the regime will dissolve, because it cannot resist either the sanctions, the economic and financial situation that we are getting into, the fact that it's rejected by the vast majority of the country and is isolated from all the partners, Americans and Europeans, that have been really supporting Georgia over the years. VOA: Different experts we talk with say that Georgia is not going to be a top priority of the Trump administration. How do you plan to bring Georgia to its attention? Zourabichvili: Well, we probably are never going to be the top priority, and I hope it won't be, because that means a crisis of a different level, which we don't want. Again, we do not want instability. But I think that what is happening in Georgia is quite important as an example. I don't think America [can] accept a country [that] has been supported and, really, constructed as a state by the United States, [making] friends with terrorist movements, with Iran, with China, and [handing over] strategic interests on the Black Sea, the port of Anaklia, or new communications lines, to China, which is what is happening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-zourabichvili-says-us-shouldn-t-back-government-that-is-result-of-rigged-elections-/7946741.html	2025-01-22T14:07:59-08:00

Trump administration freezes many health agency reports, online posts	The Trump administration has put a freeze on many federal health agency communications with the public through at least the end of the month. In a memo obtained by The Associated Press, acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dorothy Fink told agency staff leaders Tuesday that an 'immediate pause' had been ordered on — among other things — regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts until such communications had been approved by a political appointee. The pause also applies to anything intended to be published in the Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. The pause is in effect through February 1, the memo said. Agencies subject to the HHS directive include the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration — entities that fight epidemics, protect the nation's food supply, and search for cures to diseases. HHS officials did not respond to requests for comment on the pause, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Four federal health officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the issue confirmed the communication pause to the AP. A former HHS official said Wednesday that it's not unusual for incoming administrations to pause agency communications for review. But typically, officials working on the president's transition team have the process for issuing documents running smoothly by inauguration day. 'The executive branch is a hierarchy,' said Steven Grossman, who now consults for food and drug companies, in an email. 'Whether stated publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of hierarchy restored.' A pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to become coordinated, said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college. 'The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,' he added. During his first term, President Donald Trump's political appointees tried to gain control over the CDC's MMWR journal, which had published information about the COVID-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging from the White House. Fink wrote in her memo that some exceptions would be made for communications affecting 'critical health, safety, environmental, financial or nation security functions,' but that those would be subject to review. The FDA on Tuesday and Wednesday posted notices about warning letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice. A consumer advocacy group said the communications pause could still threaten public safety. Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA and other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other health issues, said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts,' Lurie said in a statement. 'Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts during active outbreaks.' He was echoed by Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert. 'Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and information about outbreaks,' Klausner wrote in an email. 'Shutting down public health communication stops a basic function of public health. Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning systems.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-freezes-many-health-agency-reports-online-posts/7946719.html	2025-01-22T13:53:52-08:00

Nigeria's new BRICS partner status sparks economic optimism, debate	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities said this week that the nation’s new partnership status with the BRICS bloc could unlock critical opportunities in trade, investment and agriculture. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu’s special adviser told Lagos-based Channels Television that the partnership, which became official Friday, is pivotal to promoting trade, investment, food security, infrastructure development and energy security. The adviser, Daniel Bwala, said the pact enables Nigeria to forge deeper strategic relationships with BRICS members beyond traditional bilateral partnerships. BRICS — an acronym for the founding members of Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa added a year later — is a political and economic bloc. BRICS introduced the 'partner country' category in October. Partner nations are a step below full membership. Economist Emeka Okengwu praised the arrangement. 'Look at the members of BRICS and the economies that they bring to the table. Brazil is probably the biggest producer of livestock and its products globally, then to aircraft, aviation and renewable energy,' Okengwu said. 'Look at Russia, India, China and South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia. These are big populations. If you put them together, they probably bring 10 times the value of whatever Europe and America can give to you,' he said. In total, the 10 BRICS member states make up 40% of the global economy and 55% of the global population. In a statement, Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said that the country’s participation in BRICS reflects its commitment to leveraging global economic opportunities to advance national development goals. Last December, Nigeria intensified efforts to join not only BRICS but also the G20 organization of the world’s major economies and the BRICS New Development Bank. Okengwu said the partnership will help Nigeria at 'being productive, taking goods and services in there, being able to meet global standards and being competitive.' 'It would've been horrible if Nigeria was not in BRICS and then we would've been left hanging with all these challenges we're having with our neighbors in the Sahel,' Okengwu said. Despite the optimism, analysts say Nigeria faces significant hurdles. The country’s struggling economy and inadequate infrastructure raise concerns about its capacity for meaningful growth through BRICS. There's also concern about how Nigeria will balance its alliances with Western nations while deepening ties with BRICS. However, Ndu Nwokolo, an economist with Nextier, suggested the challenge is manageable. 'It's about how smart you are to benefit from everybody,' Nwokolo said. 'With what we're seeing by some of the pronouncements of [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump, Nigeria may benefit from it because already Trump is talking about increasing taxes [tariffs] even within ally states. 'So, if he's going to do that with countries we think are traditional partners, so who's telling you that he will not do more with countries that he considers outsiders,' he said. 'So, we're looking at a situation where countries that are not originally traditional allies of America will try to pull together, and Nigeria may benefit from that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-new-brics-partner-status-sparks-economic-optimism-debate/7946666.html	2025-01-22T13:06:38-08:00	
Trump's agriculture secretary pick led group opposed to ethanol, farm subsidies	President Donald Trump's pick to run the Agriculture Department, Brooke Rollins, led an organization that opposed ethanol mandates and farm subsidies, major programs she could influence if confirmed, according to a Reuters review of the group's policy statements. That background may put Rollins at odds with farm state lawmakers at her nomination hearing on Thursday and revive concerns in the powerful corn and biofuel lobbies about Trump's mixed record on ethanol during his first term in office. 'The hearing is a perfect occasion to renounce the misleading and demonstrably false statements made about ethanol by some of her colleagues more than a decade ago,' said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. Rollins was president and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation from 2003 to 2018, during which time the oil industry-backed nonprofit argued that government support for ethanol contributed to higher emissions and rising food and fuel prices. The oil industry has seen ethanol as a threat to its share in the gasoline market. It says a federal mandate requiring the biofuel to be blended into the nation's fuel supply costs it a fortune in compliance costs. 'As a way to save the planet, not many policies are worse than government-backed ethanol. It’s bad for the economy, bad for the environment, doesn’t reduce greenhouse gases and has led to rapidly rising food prices,' said one article published by the Texas group in 2012. In 2017, Rollins endorsed Kathleen Hartnett White, the longtime director of the group's energy program, to serve as Trump's chair of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. The White House later withdrew her nomination after a contentious hearing that included criticism of her ethanol positions from farm state senators. White had supported a 2008 effort by then-Texas Governor Rick Perry to partly waive the ethanol blending program, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, in the state. The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the program, denied Perry's request. During Rollins' tenure, the group also called for the elimination of farm subsidies in a 2016 report titled The Policymaker's Guide to Corporate Welfare. The report said offering loan guarantees to farmers to start or expand their operations 'introduces distortions into the marketplace.' The USDA issues billions of dollars in direct and guaranteed loans each year to support the domestic farm economy. Rollins, who served as acting director of the White House Domestic Policy Council during Trump's first term, is set to appear before the Senate Agriculture Committee for her nomination hearing on Thursday. 'Brooke Rollins will work to enact the president’s agenda, and you can look to President Trump’s past statements of support for biofuels to understand the administration’s position on this issue,' said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the Trump administration transition team. During his 2017-21 term, Trump boosted corn-based ethanol by enabling year-round sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, but he also angered the ethanol industry by expanding the use of waivers exempting small refiners from the federal blending requirement. Ethanol trade group Growth Energy said it supported Rollins' nomination and believed the Trump administration would support the ethanol industry's priorities. During the Biden administration, Rollins led the America First Policy Institute, a policy organization closely tied to Trump that has expressed skepticism about climate change. More than 400 state and national agriculture groups wrote to Senate Agriculture Committee leaders John Boozman and Amy Klobuchar on January 15 to endorse Rollins. 'Her close working relationship with incoming President Trump will ensure that agriculture and rural America have a prominent and influential voice at the table when critical decisions are made in the White House,' the letter said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-agriculture-secretary-pick-led-group-opposed-to-ethanol-farm-subsidies-/7946665.html	2025-01-22T12:39:46-08:00	
Trump revokes humanitarian parole for migrants from 4 countries	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump ended on Monday a humanitarian parole program that benefited Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, and Haitians. Under the executive order called 'Securing Our Borders,' which outlines various immigration-related actions, President Trump aimed to take 'all appropriate action' to build the border wall, deploying defense personnel to the southern border, and detain irregular migrants. It also asks for elimination of certain parole programs. One such program, the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month from those countries to enter the United States legally and stay for a period of up to two years, provided they had a U.S.-based supporter. As of December 2024, about 531,690 people had entered the country under that program, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Beneficiaries were required to have a valid passport, arrange their own travel, and pass national security and public safety vetting, among other criteria. The Biden White House announced the CHNV parole program on January 5, 2023. Officials at the time said the initiative was part of the administration's efforts to discourage unlawful entries along the U.S. southern border. The program was modeled on the Ukraine program and an earlier Venezuelan program. Immediate effects The executive order took effect immediately. That means that no new applications will be accepted from individuals seeking to sponsor those migrants. Elizabeth Jacobs of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates restricting immigration to the U.S., told VOA that those who have received parole already through this program will likely be allowed to remain in the United States as parolees until their parole period expires.' At that time, Jacobs said, those individuals would be 'without status' and at risk of deportation. Programs like CNHV were a way 'Americans have been able to legally and safely sponsor newcomers in need of refuge to come to the United States, including Afghan allies,' Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, wrote on their website. 'Those who had parole protection before January 20 will have to seek immigration status through other means or risk deportation from the United States,' Cori Alonso-Yoder, told VOA. She is an immigration law professor at George Washington University. The executive orders do not indicate that humanitarian parole will be revoked for current beneficiaries of the program, said Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington during a press call on Tuesday. However, 'they certainly will not renew it.' 'So what happens to those people? If they stay in the U.S. once the two-year period ends, they will, of course, fall into unauthorized status. They will lose their work authorization and will certainly be subject to deportation,' she noted. Other legal options The program was not a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residence. However, according to immigration lawyers, beneficiaries may be able to adjust their immigration status from temporary parole to a more permanent one, such as a visa or sponsorship through a U.S. relative, which can lead to a green card. Cubans, after a year in the U.S., can apply for permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Venezuelans and Haitians may qualify for Temporary Protected Status, which provides relief from deportation and work authorization. They could also apply for asylum along with Nicaraguans. However, they must demonstrate a credible fear of persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revokes-humanitarian-parole-for-migrants-from-four-countries/7946518.html	2025-01-22T11:47:16-08:00
