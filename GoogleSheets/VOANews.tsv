California voters reject measure to ban forced prison labor	Sacramento, California — California voters have rejected a measure on the November ballot that would have amended the state constitution to ban forced prison labor. The constitution already prohibits so-called involuntary servitude, but an exception allows it to be used as a punishment for crime. That exemption became a target of criminal justice advocates concerned that prisoners are often paid less than $1 an hour for labor such as fighting fires, cleaning cells and doing landscaping work at cemeteries. The failed Proposition 6 was included in a package of reparations proposals introduced by lawmakers this year as part of an effort to atone and offer redress for a history of discrimination against Black Californians. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in the package in September to issue a formal apology for the state's legacy of racism against African Americans. But state lawmakers blocked a bill that would have created an agency to administer reparations programs, and Newsom vetoed a measure that would have helped Black families reclaim property taken unjustly by the government through eminent domain. Abolish Slavery National Network co-founder Jamilia Land, who advocated for the initiative targeting forced prison labor, said the measure and similar ones in other states are about 'dismantling the remnants of slavery' from the books. 'While the voters of California did not pass Proposition 6 this time, we have made significant progress,' she said in a statement. 'We are proud of the movement we have built, and we will not rest until we see this issue resolved once and for all.' George Eyles, a retired teacher in Brea who voted against Prop 6, said he found it confusing that the initiative aimed to ban slavery, which was outlawed in the U.S. in the 19th century. After finding out more about the measure, Eyles decided it likely would not be economically feasible since prison labor helps cut costs for upkeep, he said. 'I really couldn’t get any in-depth information about ... the thinking behind putting that whole Prop 6 forward, so that made me leery of it,' Eyles said. 'If I really can’t understand something, then I’m usually going to shake my head, ‘No.’' Multiple states — including Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama and Vermont — have voted to rid their constitutions of forced labor exemptions in recent years, and this week they were joined by Nevada, which passed its own measure. In Colorado — the first state to get rid of an exception for slavery from its constitution in 2018 — incarcerated people alleged in a 2022 lawsuit filed against the corrections department that they were still being forced to work. Proposition 6’s ballot language did not explicitly include the word 'slavery' like measures elsewhere, because the California Constitution was amended in the 1970s to remove an exemption for slavery. But the exception for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime remained on the books. The 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bans slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime. Proposition 6 saw the second-least campaign spending among the 10 statewide initiatives on the ballot this year, about $1.9 million, according to the California Secretary of State’s office. It had no formal opposition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-voters-reject-measure-to-ban-forced-prison-labor/7860226.html	2024-11-11T13:41:27-08:00	
Fire crews on both US coasts battle wildfires	RINGWOOD, New Jersey — Fire crews battled small wildfires across the Northeast U.S. on Monday, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee over the weekend and postponed Veterans Day plans. Just over half a centimeter (1/4 inch) of rain fell overnight from Sunday into Monday in a forest area straddling the border between the two states, giving a slight respite to firefighters. The fire is one of several burning on the East Coast amid a lack of much rainfall since September. An employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree. The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California. Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds. The Mountain Fire in Ventura County prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 36% contained as of Monday. The fire's size remains about 83 square kilometers (around 32 square miles). The Mountain Fire has destroyed more than 170 structures, most of them homes, officials said. The cause is under investigation. Across the country on the New Jersey and New York border, the 12.2 square-kilometer (4.7 square-mile) fire dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire was 10% contained as of midmorning Monday, and 25 structures were considered threatened, although no evacuations had been ordered, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Officials said the overnight rainfall was far less than what was needed to extinguish numerous brush fires that have broken out around New Jersey since the middle of last week. At least four other wildfires in central to northern New Jersey were mostly or completely contained as of Monday. In order to find and fight the fires, crews are navigating a maze of country roads, lakes and steep hills amid dense forests. Trees there have dropped most of their leaves onto parched ground, masking a potential danger. 'Beneath the surface leaf litter that falls off the trees, that stuff is bone dry,' Bryan Gallagher, a forest ranger with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said at a media briefing. 'So right now you get a little bit of rain that puts that surface fire out. But if it's in the duff it's going to stay there. It's going to smolder like a cigar until it gets dry enough and then that fire can pop up again.' In some areas, narrow columns of white smoke could be seen creeping out of a lakeside tree canopy Monday afternoon. With the smell of smoke permeating the air in some areas, residents negotiated a string of road closures, and even some firefighters struggled driving on winding roads with weak cellphone signals. A firefighting helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters (350 gallons) at a time was being used to help combat the Jennings Creek fire. In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander. 'Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,' he posted online. Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, the 18-year-old state parks employee killed Saturday while fighting a fire near New York state's Greenwood Lake. Health advisories had been issued over the weekend for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality produced by smoke from the fires, but conditions improved after the rainfall and changes in wind direction. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned around 400 acres (162 hectares) in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 8.8 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in the city some 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of Boston. The Lynn Fire Department cited 'a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.' 'We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further,' Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday. The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing on Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. Before Sunday night, the last measurable rainfall in New Jersey occurred on Sept. 28.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-crews-on-both-us-coasts-battle-wildfires/7860219.html	2024-11-11T13:32:59-08:00	
Haiti swears in new PM as gangs shoot at flight landing at airport	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti’s international airport shut down temporarily Monday after gangs opened fire at a Spirit Airlines flight landing in Port-Au-Prince, the U.S. State Department and the airline said. The latest violence came as a new prime minister was sworn in. The flight, headed from Fort Lauderdale to Port-Au-Prince, was hit multiple times by gunfire as it was set to land in Haiti’s capital, striking a flight attendant, who suffered minor injuries. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane. The flight was diverted and landed in the Dominican Republic, according to Spirit Airlines. It appeared to be part of what the U.S. Embassy called 'gang-led efforts to block travel to and from Port-au-Prince which may include armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.' In other parts of Haiti’s capital, firefights between gangs and police broke out. Rounds of gunfire echoed through the streets as heavily armed officers ducked behind walls and civilians ran in terror. In other upper-class areas, gangs set fire to homes. Schools closed as panic spread in a number of areas. The turmoil comes a day after a council meant to reestablish democratic order in the Caribbean nation fired the interim Prime Minister Garry Conille, replacing him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The council has been marked by infighting and three members were recently accused of corruption. On Monday, suit-clad diplomats and security officials flocked to the swearing-in ceremony, set to take place in the afternoon. The country has seen weeks of political chaos, which observers warned could result in even more violence in a place where bloodshed has become the new normal. The country's gangs have long capitalized on political turmoil to make power grabs, shutting down airports, shipping ports and stirring chaos. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti’s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell violence, which exploded after Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in 2021. The council was meant to pave the way to democratic elections, which haven’t been held in years in Haiti. Gangs have capitalized on that power vacuum to make their own power grabs. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Garry Conille, the interim prime minister they handpicked six months ago, who they fired yesterday. Organizations including the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements to save the fragile transition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-swears-in-pm-as-gangs-shoot-at-flight-landing-at-airport/7860208.html	2024-11-11T13:14:57-08:00	
Abolitionist Harriet Tubman posthumously named 'general' in Veterans Day ceremony	CHURCH CREEK, Maryland — Revered abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who was the first woman to oversee an American military action during a time of war, was posthumously awarded the rank of general on Monday. Dozens gathered on Veterans Day at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Maryland's Dorchester County for a formal ceremony making Tubman a one-star brigadier general in the state's National Guard. Gov. Wes Moore called the occasion not just a great day for Tubman's home state but for all the U.S. 'Today, we celebrate a soldier and a person who earned the title of veteran,' Moore said. 'Today we celebrate one of the greatest authors of the American story.' Tubman escaped slavery herself in 1849, settling in Philadelphia in 1849. Intent on helping others achieve freedom, she established the Underground Railroad network and led other enslaved Black women and men to freedom. She then channeled those experiences as a scout, spy and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War, helping guide 150 Black soldiers on a gunboat raid in South Carolina. Nobody would have judged Tubman had she chosen to remain in Philadelphia and coordinate abolitionist efforts from there, Moore said. 'She knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion’s den,' Moore said. 'She knew that leadership means you have to be willing to do what you are asking others to do.' The reading of the official order was followed by a symbolic pinning ceremony with Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Tina Wyatt. Wyatt hailed her aunt's legacy of tenacity, generosity and faith and agreed Veterans Day applied to her as much as any other service member. 'Aunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally, she gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others,' Wyatt said. 'She is a selfless person.' Tubman's status as an icon of history has only been further elevated within the last few years. The city of Philadelphia chose a Black artist to make a 14-foot (4.3-meter) bronze statue to go on display next year. In 2022, a Chicago elementary school was renamed for Tubman, replacing the previous namesake, who had racist views. However, plans to put Tubman on the $20 bill have continued to stall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abolitionist-harriet-tubman-posthumously-named-general-in-veterans-day-ceremony/7860197.html	2024-11-11T12:56:41-08:00	
Former UK soldier accused of helping Iran pleads guilty to prison escape	London — A British soldier accused of passing sensitive information to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps pleaded guilty Monday to escaping from prison while awaiting trial. Daniel Abed Khalife is on trial at London's Woolwich Crown Court, accused of collecting sensitive information between May 2019 and January 2022. Khalife, who is no longer a member of the British armed forces, also denies leaving a fake bomb on a desk and absconding from his barracks in 2023. Prosecutors had also alleged Khalife escaped from London's Wandsworth prison in September 2023 by tying himself to the bottom of a delivery van, sparking a brief nationwide manhunt. The 23-year-old had originally pleaded not guilty to escaping from lawful custody but changed his plea to guilty Monday after having given evidence for several days earlier this month. Khalife is also charged with gathering information that might be useful to an enemy, namely Iran, obtaining information likely to be useful for terrorism and perpetrating a bomb hoax. He still denies those three charges and his trial continues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-uk-soldier-accused-of-helping-iran-pleads-guilty-to-prison-escape-/7860042.html	2024-11-11T10:51:53-08:00	
Palau’s president secures 2nd term amid attempt to navigate US-China competition	Taipei, Taiwan — Palau’s President Surangel Whipps Jr. has secured another term in office after defeating former President Tommy Remengesau Jr. in its Nov. 5 election that was closely monitored. Palau sits on the front line of competition for geopolitical influence between the United States and China in the Pacific Ocean. While election authorities still haven’t finished counting absentee ballots, Whipps has won the vote with one of the biggest margins in Palau’s electoral history, 57.5%. Remengesau, who is Whipps’ brother-in-law, took 41.3%. Whipps thanked supporters for allowing him to continue 'building on the progress' that his administration has achieved over the last four years. 'Your decision to grant me a second term as president is a responsibility I hold with the utmost respect,' he said in a statement shared with VOA on Monday. The president can only have two consecutive four-year terms and must step down after that, but he can run again after a four-year gap in between. Remengesau has served a total of four terms already. Separately, the spokesperson for Palau’s election commission told Radio New Zealand the following day that it was 'highly unlikely' that Whipps would lose the election. Meanwhile, in a concession speech broadcast by a local radio station, the Palau Wave Productions, on November 7, Remengesau said the election is finished and the Palauan people have 'spoken through a peaceful and free election.' Analysts say the outcome shows more Palauan voters support Whipps’ policy agenda, which includes tax reforms and deeper engagement with the United States. 'It seems Palau’s closer relationship with the United States under Whipps Jr.’s leadership makes sense for the majority of Palauans,' said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Palau has a population of around 20,000 people and is situated around 890 kilometers (550 miles) east of the Philippines. It is one of three Pacific Island countries that receive significant economic support from the U.S. under agreements known as the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. Under the accords, the U.S. provides economic aid worth billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their land, water and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to their ports and territorial waters. In September, U.S. lawmakers passed funding for key provisions in COFA for Palau. The U.S. military is also helping to repair a runway on a World War II-era Japanese airfield on the island of Peleliu and installing two radar systems on Palau. Experts say they expect Palau to keep deepening ties with the U.S. during Whipps’ second term and relevant efforts will likely include increasing the frequency of U.S. military visits and enhancing connectivity with Palau. 'There’s going to be a much stronger U.S. presence in terms of military visits, joint actions to combat transnational crime and illegal fishing, and boost transport and digital connectivity,' Meg Keen, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia, told VOA by phone. During his first term, Whipps repeatedly said 'presence is deterrence,' referring to the increased U.S. military presence in Palau, and characterized the Pacific island country as 'part of the U.S. homeland' when it comes to security. In an interview with VOA last month, Whipps said U.S. protection plays a key role in safeguarding Palau’s territorial integrity. 'Since Palau is small, having the protection of the United States is important because we see what’s happening now in the South China Sea between the Philippines and China,' he said during an interview at his office in Koror, Palau. Since 2023, the Chinese and Philippine coast guards have repeatedly confronted each other at several disputed shoals that both sides claim to be their territories. While Beijing views almost the entire South China Sea as its territorial water, a 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid. Beijing refuses to abide by the ruling. While many Palauans support the Whipps administration’s efforts to deepen security ties with the U.S., some political observers say some Palauans are still concerned about the negative impacts associated with the increased U.S. military presence across the Pacific island country. 'Some Palauan people hold this apprehensiveness about the implication of increased U.S. military presence in Palau because they rarely saw U.S. soldiers in military uniforms in the past,' Kambes Kesolei, editor of one of Palau’s main newspapers, Tia Belau, told VOA by phone. 'Some Palauans wonder what they can do to prevent Palau from becoming over-militarized,' he added. In addition to deepening ties with the U.S., some analysts say Palau will maintain its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which could lead to 'increased coercive pressure' from China. Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunite with the island, by force if necessary. 'I expect ties between Palau and Taiwan to remain robust but increasing coercive pressure from the People’s Republic of China, [PRC,] may increase risks for Palau, which will need strong support from the U.S. and like-minded partners to maintain resiliency against PRC coercion,' Parker Novak, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA in a written response. Whipps has accused China of weaponizing tourism against Palau and posing a wide range of threats to the Pacific island country’s national security, including cyberattacks and illegal incursion of Palau’s territorial water by Chinese vessels. 'In 2015 and 2016, tourism numbers from China went through the roof, which helped Palau’s economy grow 30%, but since Palau never switched diplomatic recognition [from Taiwan] to China, that number just basically collapsed in the following years,' Whipps told VOA. In response to questions about Whipps’ claim that China has pressured Palau to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a regular press conference on November 4 that only a small number of countries, including Palau, still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 'China urges these countries to fulfill their obligations under international law, stand on the right side of history, and make right decisions that truly serve their fundamental and long-term interests at an early date,' she said. While Whipps is likely to remain critical of China’s attempt to coerce Palau, Keen in Australia said the Palauan president is not going to completely 'shut the door for China.' 'He is very much wary of how China has used land and tourism to build pressure, but if the investment is in the national interests of Palau, he is willing to consider,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palau-s-president-secures-2nd-term-amid-attempt-to-navigate-us-china-competition/7859923.html	2024-11-11T09:15:32-08:00	
Human Rights Watch calls for protection force in Sudan as attacks on civilians escalate	Nairobi — A prominent human rights group is calling for the deployment of peacekeepers in Sudan, following a recent wave of attacks on civilians in Al Jazirah state widely blamed on the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring sides in the country’s ongoing conflict. Human Rights Watch says the situation has become so grim that a mission is needed to protect the population. According to a local pro-democracy group, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, 169 people have been killed since the violence started in southeastern Jazirah state on Oct. 20. The attacks began after a commander for the Rapid Support Forces defected and joined the Sudanese army. Rights groups report that in response, RSF forces entered villages and towns in the area where the commander was from and carried out targeted killings and abuse. Laetitia Bader, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division, said the violations have added more problems for a population reeling from more than 18 months of war. 'Sudanese women's rights groups have been documenting cases of sexual violence against women and girls in these towns and villages. And we're talking here about over 30 towns and villages which have been attacked in recent weeks, and these attacks are ongoing,' Bader said. 'It led to massive displacement of the civilian population in an area where people had already fled to and from. So it's just adding to the layers of suffering.' The RSF has denied attacking communities in Jazirah state and has accused Sudanese forces of arming local communities. The RSF and Sudan’s military have been at war since April of last year. Rival generals lead the parties and are locked in a power struggle. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch and other observers are calling for the deployment of peacekeepers to Jazirah and other parts of Sudan, in hopes of protecting civilians. Getting a presence on the ground could deter further attacks and help monitor humanitarian obstruction, Bader said, and also play a role in bolstering local cease-fire efforts and efforts by emergency response teams to provide assistance. 'Right now the problem is that what is happening at the local level cannot act alone,' Bader added. Ahmed Hashi, a Horn of Africa political and security commentator, said troops are needed, and strong action must be taken against the leaders of the warring groups. 'There is a need to send at least 50,000 United Nations soldiers. There is a need to take the criminal generals to the International Criminal Court and issue a warrant for their arrest,' Hashi said. 'It is important for the United Nations to put its foot down on conflicts because they are going to metastasize into a massive humanitarian catastrophe.' In a report issued last month, the office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed shock at the human rights violations often witnessed in Sudan’s western Darfur region being repeated in the Jazirah area. The United Nations Security Council is slated to discuss the report on Sudan later this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-calls-for-protection-force-in-sudan-as-attacks-on-civilians-escalate/7859918.html	2024-11-11T09:11:21-08:00	
Harris appears with Biden for first time since election loss	U.S. President Joe Biden laid a wreath Monday to honor the nation's fallen soldiers on Veterans Day, an event marking his first appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris since her election defeat last week. The ceremony, at historic Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, is also the first time Harris has been seen in public since her Nov. 6 speech in which she conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump. Democrats, facing a painful reckoning over their drubbing, have begun soul-searching internal discussions — and some not-so-private blaming — over what caused Harris's loss, with some pointing to Biden's initial insistence on running again at age 81, despite having promised to be a bridge president to the next generation. Criticism of Harris herself has been more muted, and Biden heaped praise on Harris last Thursday in a televised White House address. Earlier Monday, Biden hosted veterans at the White House to mark the holiday before heading to Arlington, the final resting place of two presidents, generals from all major U.S. wars, and thousands of other military personnel. Biden and Harris, both dressed in dark suits, placed their hands on their hearts before participating in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The president was to deliver remarks at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater. The ceremony comes ahead of Biden hosting Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The Republican has begun naming loyalists to his new administration. He announced he is bringing a hard-line immigration official, Tom Homan, back into the fold to serve as his so-called 'border czar,' and congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump himself has long claimed he is a fierce supporter of America's military, but he has made a series of controversial comments about veterans. His longest-serving White House chief of staff, retired general John Kelly, has said the Republican leader privately disparaged U.S. service members, including describing those who died or were imprisoned defending America as 'suckers' and 'losers.' Trump denies the accusation. But the soon-to-be 47th president has been on record expressing contempt for late American war hero and senator John McCain, who spent years in a Hanoi prison during the Vietnam war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-appears-with-biden-for-first-time-since-election-loss/7859912.html	2024-11-11T09:04:46-08:00	
Israel sees progress in Lebanon cease-fire talks, says Russia can help	Jerusalem/Beirut — Israel said on Monday there was progress in talks about a Lebanon cease-fire and indicated Russia could play a part by stopping Hezbollah rearming via Syria, although the Iran-backed group said it had not received any new truce proposals. Pummeled by Israel's offensive, Hezbollah said diplomatic contacts were under way involving its backers in Tehran, Washington and Moscow, whilst reiterating its readiness to fight on, saying it had enough weapons for a 'long war.' In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the war against Hezbollah was not yet over. The main challenge facing any cease-fire deal would be enforcement, he said, though there was 'a certain progress' in talks. After previous rounds of fruitless U.S.-led diplomacy to secure a Lebanon truce, the comments indicate renewed focus on the issue as President Joe Biden prepares to leave office in January, with President-elect Donald Trump set to replace him. Hopes of a Gaza truce have meanwhile suffered a setback, with Qatar suspending its mediation role. Ignited by the war in Gaza, the conflict at the Lebanese-Israeli border had been rumbling on for a year before Israel went on the offensive in late September, pounding wide areas of Lebanon with airstrikes and sending troops into the south. Saar, addressing a Jerusalem news conference, said Israel was working with the United States on a cease-fire. Israel wants Hezbollah north of the Litani river – some 30 km from the border - and unable to rearm, he said. Saar said a basic principle for any agreement had to be that Hezbollah would not be able to bring weapons into Lebanon from Syria. 'It is vital to the success of any arrangement in Lebanon,' he said. 'And the Russians are, as you know, present in Syria. And if they are in agreement with this principle, I think they can contribute effectively to this objective.' Russia deployed forces into Syria nearly a decade ago to support President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war there. Hezbollah also sent fighters to help Assad, and carved out big sway on the ground alongside other Iran-backed groups. Syria is widely seen as a major conduit for Iran to supply weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israel has struck targets in Syria regularly during the conflict. An Israeli airstrike temporarily cut Syria's main Homs-Damascus highway on Monday, Syrian media reported. In Lebanon, relatives held funerals for 20 people killed in a strike on the southern town of Deir Qanoun-Ras al-Ain, including seven medics from rescue groups affiliated with Hezbollah and its Shiite ally Amal. 'Testing the waters' In Beirut, Hezbollah official Mohammad Afif linked intensified political contacts to the looming change of U.S. leadership. 'There is a great movement between Washington and Moscow and Tehran and a number of capitals,' he said. 'We hear a lot of talk, but so far, according to my information, nothing official has reached Lebanon or us in this regard,' he told a news conference. The contacts were 'in the phase of testing the waters and presenting initial ideas.' Israel Hayom reported on Sunday that substantial progress has been made in diplomatic negotiations over a proposed Lebanon cease-fire that would require Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, barring its military presence near the Israeli border, while the IDF would return to the international border. Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's best-selling newspaper, reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have exchanged drafts through U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, signaling progress in efforts to reach a final agreement. The Lebanese government, which includes Hezbollah, has repeatedly called for a cease-fire based on the full implementation of a U.N. resolution that ended a war between the group and Israel in 2006. The resolution calls for the area south of the Litani river to be free of all weapons other than those of the Lebanese state. Lebanon and Israel have accused each other of violating the resolution. Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate the north due to rockets fired by Hezbollah, which opened fire on Oct. 8, 2003, in solidarity with Hamas. Israel's offensive has forced more than 1 million people to flee their homes in Lebanon in the last seven weeks. Since the eruption of hostilities a year ago, Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,189 people in Lebanon, the majority of them since late September, according to health ministry figures, which do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hezbollah attacks have killed roughly 100 civilians and soldiers in northern Israel, the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon over the last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sees-progress-in-lebanon-cease-fire-talks-says-russia-can-help/7859720.html	2024-11-11T07:15:26-08:00	
Trump taps Stefanik to be UN Ambassador	Washington — Donald Trump has chosen Republican Representative Elise Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the president-elect said in a statement shared with Reuters on Monday. 'I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,' Trump said. Stefanik, a New York representative and House Republican Conference chair, has been a fierce Trump ally. She could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. Haley served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump during his previous term and had endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his Jan. 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump has also met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-stefanik-to-be-un-ambassador-/7859706.html	2024-11-11T06:59:43-08:00

Locals move to protect Chile's giant desert geoglyphs scarred by off-roaders	IQUIQUE, Chile — Over a thousand years ago, the hundreds of giant geoglyphs carved into the desert in northern Chile were a bustling scene. They marked sources of water in the vast arid landscape and were where locals came together to trade skins, animals and fish. Now the carvings are scarred with hundreds of tire tracks from motorcycles and off-road vehicles tearing through the art creations in the landscape and permanently disfiguring them. 'It's practically destroyed by motorcycles, off-roaders,' said Jose Barraza, general director of the regional national patrimony office. He said various groups were trying to preserve the site to prevent any more destruction - but also without restoring it to its former glory, to show the error of people's ways in the future. '[It] will be an example that shows future generations what not to do with our heritage, no matter how painful or how much anger, discomfort or resentment we feel towards it,' he said. Local resident Angelo Araya says the community has been working with a local museum and authorities to try and 'put an end to the destruction.' The goal, Araya says, is to stop motorcycle and off-road vehicles from damaging the site further and 'to make everyone aware that this is not just a heritage site, but that it belongs to all of us.' The site has gone through many phases, going from a place to barter, to an abandoned site, to one where people were looking for gold. Eventually Chile's national forests association CONAF turned the area into part of the Pampa del Tamarugal National Reserve. Sand board instructor Franco Diaz said the government should physically close off access to the sites as the geoglyphs are difficult to spot. 'If a jeep driver goes behind the hill, he won't notice if there's a geoglyph,' Diaz said. 'They should close the perimeter and protect these sites that are over 1,000 years old.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/locals-move-to-protect-chile-s-giant-desert-geoglyphs-scarred-by-off-roaders-/7859550.html	2024-11-11T04:32:17-08:00	
Mauritius prime minister says party is headed for defeat in Sunday's vote	PORT LOUIS — Mauritius incumbent prime minister Pravind Jugnauth said on Monday that his political alliance was headed for a huge defeat following Sunday's parliamentary election. 'L'Alliance Lepep is heading towards a huge defeat. I have tried to do what I can for the country and the population. The population has decided to choose another team. I wish good luck to the country,' Jugnauth told reporters. Voters went to the polls to elect lawmakers for the 62 seats in parliament for the next five years, from a list of 68 parties and five political alliances. Whichever party or coalition gets more than half the seats in parliament also wins the prime minister's post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mauritius-prime-minister-says-party-is-headed-for-defeat-in-sunday-s-vote/7859534.html	2024-11-11T04:05:22-08:00	
17 Chadian soldiers and 96 rebels killed in a Boko Haram attack, army says	N'DJAMENA — Boko Haram insurgents killed 17 Chadian soldiers in a weekend attack on a military post that also left 96 of the assailants dead in the country's west, Chad's army said. The attack in the Lake Chad region happened on Saturday, army spokesperson Gen. Issakh Acheikh said on national television Sunday night. He did not provide details. The Lake Chad region has been plagued this year by frequent attacks from insurgents, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. It has revived fears of violence after a period of peace following a successful operation launched in 2020 by the Chadian army to destroy the extremist groups' bases. Last month, 40 soldiers were killed during an attack on a military base, prompting President Mahamat Deby Itno to launch an operation to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. In March, an attack the government blamed on Boko Haram killed seven soldiers. Boko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigeria’s northeast. The insurgency has spread to West African neighbors including Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Chad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itno’s victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-soldiers-and-96-rebels-killed-in-a-boko-haram-attack-army-says/7859520.html	2024-11-11T03:52:19-08:00	
Pakistan limits outdoor activities, market hours to curb air pollution-related illness	LAHORE, Pakistan — Pakistan's Punjab province banned most outdoor activities and ordered shops, markets and malls in some areas to close early from Monday to curb illnesses caused by intense air pollution. The province has already closed educational institutions and public spaces like parks and zoos until Nov. 17 in places including Lahore, the world's most polluted city in terms of air quality, according to Swiss group IQAir's live ratings. The districts of Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala have seen an unprecedented rise in patients with respiratory diseases, eye and throat irritation, and pink eye disease, the Punjab government said in an order issued late on Sunday. The new restrictions would also remain in force until Nov. 17, it said. 'The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,' it said. While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, 'unavoidable religious rites' are exempt from this direction, the order said. Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the broad directions, and to close by 8 p.m. local time. Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month. A score of 0-50 is considered 'good.' Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires. Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighboring country through its foreign ministry. India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported. Firecrackers set off by revelers on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights that was celebrated on Oct. 31 this year despite a ban, has aggravated the region's pollution problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-limits-outdoor-activities-market-hours-to-curb-air-pollution-related-illness-/7859510.html	2024-11-11T03:35:52-08:00	
Houthis fire missile toward Israeli base	An intercepted missile fired from Yemen sparked blazes near Jerusalem Monday, and later the Houthi rebels said they carried out a successful attack on central Israel. The Iran-backed militant group said it executed a 'military operation targeting the Nahal Sorek military base' southeast of Jaffa, and that the 'hit was accurate and led to a fire.' Meanwhile, the main television news outlet operated by the Houthis said U.S. and British forces carried out a series of airstrikes targeting the Amran and Saada governorates in Yemen. The Israeli military told Agence France-Presse a projectile from Yemen was intercepted in the Bet Shemesh area west of Jerusalem, and debris from that interception caused fires. In a statement to the AFP, it said: 'Following the sirens that sounded in the Shfelat Yehuda, Yehuda, and Lakhish areas of central Israel, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) intercepted one projectile that approached Israel from the direction of Yemen. 'The projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Sirens were sounded in accordance with protocol.' An Iran-backed coalition, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, claimed to have carried out four drone attacks on 'vital targets' in Israel Monday, but did not disclose details about the targets in a series of Telegram posts. Strikes in Gaza, Lebanon At least three people were killed Sunday when an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering a displaced family in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian health officials reported. Palestinians reported heavy bombing late Sunday in the western areas of Nuseirat camp, and least 24 people were wounded and taken to the Awda hospital in Nuseirat, the head of the hospital’s ambulance service told the Associated Press. Earlier Sunday in northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's health ministry said another six people were wounded. There was no Israeli evacuation warning and no immediate Israeli comment on the attack. The United Nations children’s agency says the war between Israel and Hezbollah has killed more than 200 children in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said at least 3,189 people have been killed and over 14,000 wounded in Lebanon in more than a year of conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Some 1.2 million people have been displaced. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, European Union and others. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday in Washington as the mid-month deadline approaches for Israel to meet a Biden administration ultimatum that it allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to assist Palestinians or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Information from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters was included in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-missile-toward-israeli-base-/7859492.html	2024-11-11T03:24:06-08:00	
Taiwan closes exploding pagers case, says not made by Taiwanese firms	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan on Monday said it had closed a probe into pagers that exploded in Lebanon in September and caused a deadly blow to Iran-backed Hezbollah, saying no Taiwanese citizens or companies were involved. Israeli media reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed responsibility for the attack during a cabinet meeting, telling ministers that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation. Security sources have previously said the pagers carried the name of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, a company which has asserted that it did not make them. Taiwan's government has also said the pagers were not made in Taiwan. Taipei prosecutors, who were investigating the case, said in a statement the AR-924 pager model that exploded in Lebanon was manufactured, traded, and shipped by a firm called Frontier Group Entity, and made outside of Taiwan. They added, however, that Gold Apollo had authorized the company to use the Apollo trademark. 'There is no evidence indicating that any domestic manufacturers or individuals were accomplices in the relevant explosions, violating the Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, or engaging in other illegal activities,' the prosecutors said in a statement. 'No concrete evidence of criminal activity has been discovered in this case, nor have any specific individuals been implicated in any criminal activity, following a comprehensive investigation.' Prosecutors have previously confirmed that they questioned Gold Apollo's president and founder Hsu Ching-kuang and a woman called Teresa Wu, the sole employee of a company called Apollo Systems Ltd. In their statement, the prosecutors said Wu acted as a liaison with Frontier, but there was no evidence she 'had prior knowledge or participated in any conspiracy or collaboration related to the explosion incidents.' The prosecutors said there was some information they did not know, including the exact identities of the Frontier employees Wu communicated with. It said one person was called 'T' and was presumably the head of Frontier, while another was called 'M' and was presumably the sales director. Gold Apollo told Reuters it had also just seen the prosecutor’s statement, and that it was not immediately able to comment further.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-closes-exploding-pagers-case-says-not-made-by-taiwanese-firms/7859489.html	2024-11-11T03:10:19-08:00

Ukraine on high alert, Russian troops amass near Kursk	While Ukraine was on high alert for air attacks on Monday, the country’s top military commander said tens of thousands of Russian troops were ready to advance on the Kursk region. 'Following the order of their military leadership, they are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control,' Ukraine’s General Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine launched an incursion into Kursk in August, taking control of a number of towns and villages in the border region. Meanwhile, at least six people were killed in air attacks in southern Ukraine – five in Mykolaiv and one in Zaporizhzhia, where a residential building was destroyed, regional governors reported. At least a dozen people were injured in Zaporizhzhia, including five children between the ages of 4 and 17. Earlier, the Ukrainian air force put the nation on high alert for a large-scale missile attack, reporting that a large number of bombers were taking off from Russia and heading to Ukraine. 'The air alert is related to the launch of cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,' the air force said on its Telegram channels. Power was cut to prevent further damage from attacks, and people were encouraged to seek shelter – including in Kyiv’s metro stations. But by 0630 GMT the missiles had not arrived. According to some Ukrainian military bloggers, the Russian bombers performed flights imitating the launch of missiles, Reuters reported. Report: Trump urges Putin not to escalate The Washington Post and Reuters reported that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and urged him not to escalate the war in Ukraine. Trump, calling from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday, reminded Putin of America's sizable military presence in Europe, the Washington Post reported. Sources familiar with the call told the newspaper Trump expressed an interest in further conversations to discuss 'the resolution of Ukraine's war soon.' Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, did not confirm the exchange, saying in a written statement to AFP that 'we do not comment on private calls between President Trump and other world leaders.' The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported. Information from Reuters and Agence France-Presse was included in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-on-high-alert-russian-troops-amass-near-kursk/7859440.html	2024-11-11T01:21:38-08:00	
The Singles' Day shopping festival loses its shine under China's lagging economy	HONG KONG — Merchants and consumers alike found the Singles' Day shopping festival Monday less shiny than in years past as e-commerce firms look abroad for growth. The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad. While Singles’ Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment. But amid China’s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out on purchases during the shopping extravaganza. 'I only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,' said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in Beijing. Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles’ Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. 'They’re all tricks and we’ve seen through it over the years,' she said. Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in Xi’an city, echoed Wang’s sentiments, saying that he no longer trust Singles’ Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual price of a product before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal. 'I used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles’ Day),' he said. 'I stopped doing that following the pandemic because of less income. I am not going to buy anything this year,' Zhang added. Some experts say that Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had little impact to boost consumer confidence. 'People are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,' said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. 'Since October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts that the month before.' Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles’ Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead. Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers 'trade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,' he said. Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, which operates e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, previously used to publish the value of transactions made during the festival, but have since stopped revealing the total figure. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth. Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year’s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to $156.40 billion, a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19. Merchants who typically take part in the Singles’ Day shopping festivals say the costs of participation no longer pay off, amid high advertising fees and unsatisfactory sales. Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying advertising costs to e-commerce platforms he would only break even after sales. 'The platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,' he said. 'As a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles’ Day promotions.' Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said that overall sales in the past year have fallen 15% as consumers downgraded and reduced consumption. Du said that while he still takes part in the Singles’ Day promotions, the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of sluggish sales. 'We are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us to maintain our leading sales position,' he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers. Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have also turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell globally with ease. Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, Alibaba said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-singles-day-shopping-festival-loses-its-shine-under-china-s-lagging-economy-/7859428.html	2024-11-11T00:36:28-08:00	
I got my life back': Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service dog program	KANSAS CITY, Kan. — After working at a crowded and dangerous internment camp in Iraq, Air Force Staff Sgt. Heather O'Brien brought home with her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. A bouncy labradoodle and a Kansas City-area program helped her get back on her feet. Dogs 4 Valor, operated through the Olathe, Kansas-based organization called The Battle Within, helps retired veterans and first responders work with their service dogs to help manage depression, anxiety and other challenges. 'A lot of times the veteran with severe PTSD is homebound,' said Sandra Sindeldecker, program manager for Dogs 4 Valor. 'They’re isolated. They’re very nervous. They won’t make eye contact. Some won’t leave the house at all.' The program involves both group and one-on-one training. The goal is to get the veteran and the dog comfortable with each other and understanding each other. The group takes outings to help the veterans regain their footing in public places like airports. Program leaders also provide mental health therapy at no cost. The veterans and dogs graduate in six to nine months, but group gatherings continue. O'Brien, 40, recalled that the camp where she worked in Iraq sometimes had over 20,000 detainees. Violence and rioting were common and it left her with severe anxiety. 'When I got out of the military, I just assumed that you’re supposed to be on edge all the time as a veteran,' O’Brien said. O’Brien’s mother spotted the frisky lab-poodle mix on Facebook and convinced her daughter to adopt the dog she named Albus. Months later, O'Brien learned about Dogs 4 Valor, and the pair joined the program in October 2023. Now, O’Brien said she can get back out in public — she even went on vacation to Branson, Missouri, 'things that I never would have thought I would do really, probably ever again.' Mark Atkinson, 38, served in Afghanistan as a corporal in the Marine Corps. He returned home with PTSD and major depressive disorder, causing sleeplessness and anxiety. He adopted Lexi, now 5, in 2020. Lexi, a muscular cane corso breed, needed Atkinson as much as he needed her. Her previous owner had kept Lexi on chains before surrendering her. Since joining Dogs 4 Valor, the two can get out together and enjoy life. 'I don’t really like leaving the house because I’m safe there, you know?' Atkinson said. 'And having Lexi has just made me get out to be more social.' Having a group of fellow veterans facing the same challenges has also helped, Atkinson said. 'We come from the same backgrounds, different branches,' Atkinson said. 'Same issues. You know, PTSD or traumatic brain injuries. And they’re all very welcoming as well. There’s no judgment.' O’Brien compared living with Albus to a relationship with a sometimes pushy best friend who often wants to go out. 'The best friend constantly wants to make you do things that make you nervous,' O’Brien laughed, acknowledging that it is ultimately up to her. 'I have to decide to walk out and just deal with life,' O'Brien said. 'And so that has been hard. And it still is hard from time to time, but it’s it’s getting manageable.' Some veterans said their family relationships have improved since they started the program. 'I’m able to talk, not fly off the handle and just get along with people and not be as stressed, not have as much anxiety,' Atkinson said. 'Or even if I do, she (Lexi) is right there with me.' Timothy Siebenmorgen, 61, said his relationships also are better with help from his 1-year-old American bulldog, Rosie, and Dogs 4 Valor, which he joined in July. He served in both the Marines and Army, deploying 18 times. 'You’re in the military, kind of taught not to show weakness,' Siebenmorgen said. 'So you figure you can tackle everything yourself and you honestly believe that. And then you realize you can’t do it on your own.' Veterans said the dogs, and the program, have given them new hope and a renewed ability to move forward. 'I got my life back,' O’Brien said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/i-got-my-life-back-veterans-with-ptsd-making-progress-thanks-to-service-dog-program-/7859423.html	2024-11-11T00:13:05-08:00	
Web Summit kicks off in Lisbon as tech leaders weigh Trump’s return	LISBON, PORTUGAL — Lisbon will this week play host to Europe’s biggest annual tech conference, Web Summit, where industry leaders and lawmakers will weigh the pros and cons of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Senior executives from firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and Meta will join high-ranking officials from Europe for debates about the future of artificial intelligence, social media regulation, and the impact a second Trump presidency may have on the continent. Trump has previously promised he could end the war between Ukraine and Russia within 24 hours of taking office. Days after Trump's re-election, two senior Ukrainian government officials, Alex Bornyakov and Mykhailo Fedorov, will take to the stage to discuss how the country has continued innovating in the face of conflict. John Adam, chief revenue officer at software development firm Aimsoftpro, is among those attending. About 70% of the company’s workforce is still based in Ukraine, with the rest having relocated around Europe after the war’s outbreak in 2022. 'There’s mixed feelings because the Trump approach looks like it’s more geared towards the present lines of conflict, which is not an ideal scenario for Ukraine, and there’s a reluctance to accept that. At the same time, we would like this to have an endpoint,' he said. The X factor While not expected to attend, tech billionaire and vocal Trump supporter Elon Musk will be a recurring theme, from his role in Ukraine via satellite service Starlink to his success with space exploration firm SpaceX and controversial stewardship of social media platform X, formerly Twitter. One panel will debate how Europe might develop a homegrown rival to SpaceX; another whether Musk 'destroyed Twitter.' Joe Benarroch, who quit his role as X’s de facto spokesperson and head of business operations in June, will join a panel titled 'What to do about social media.' While the EU has tried forcing online platforms to clamp down on harmful content, Trump’s election may lead to them reducing moderation efforts, according to Mark Weinstein, founder of privacy-focused social media platform MeWe, who will share the stage with Benarroch on Wednesday. 'Historically, Trump has been highly critical of online moderation,' he said. 'To avoid political retribution, major social networks are likely to continue the trend of becoming significantly more permissive with content they allow on their platforms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/web-summit-kicks-off-in-lisbon-as-tech-leaders-weigh-trump-s-return/7859398.html	2024-11-10T22:51:48-08:00	
Vietnam says Temu, Shein must register with government or be blocked	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam said Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu need to register with the government before the end of November or it will block their internet domains and apps from being used in the country. Vietnam's government and local businesses have expressed concern about the impact of Chinese online platforms on local markets due to deep discounting. The trade ministry has also said it is worried about the potential for the sale of counterfeit items. Nguyen Hoang Long, Vietnam's deputy trade minister, told a government meeting at the weekend that the ministry had worked with both Shein and Temu on the licensing matter. 'After the ministry's notification, if these platforms do not comply, the Ministry of Industry and Trade will coordinate with relevant agencies to implement technical measures such as blocking applications and domains,' Long said in a government statement. Shein and Temu did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Fast-fashion retailer Shein has been selling into Vietnam for at least two years, while Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, started allowing users in Vietnam to shop last month. Vietnam allows imported goods of up to $40 to be exempt from a value-added tax. The finance ministry said most items benefiting from this tax break are imported via e-commerce platforms and it is considering terminating the tax break. Both Temu and Shein are also facing increased scrutiny and legal challenges elsewhere. Last month, Indonesia requested Apple and Google block Temu from their app stores to protect small merchants from competing with ultra-cheap items. Vietnam's e-commerce market has grown 18% this year to be worth $22 billion, the third-largest in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia and Thailand, according to a report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company released last week. Other e-commerce platforms that operate in Vietnam include Singapore-based Shoppe, Alibaba-backed Lazada and domestic companies Tiki and Sendo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-says-temu-shein-must-register-with-government-or-be-blocked/7859396.html	2024-11-10T22:42:57-08:00	
Trump and trade worries cloud COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan	Baku, Azerbaijan — The annual U.N. climate summit kicks off Monday with countries readying for tough talks on finance and trade, following a year of weather disasters that have emboldened developing countries in their demands for climate cash. Delegates gathering in Azerbaijan's capital of Baku are hoping to resolve the summit's top agenda item – a deal for up to $1 trillion in annual climate finance for developing countries. The summit's negotiating priorities, however, are competing for governments' resources and attention against economic concerns, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and last week's U.S. re-election of Donald Trump, a climate-change denier, as president of the world's biggest economy. COP29 host Azerbaijan will be tasked with keeping countries focused on agreeing to a new global finance target to replace the current $100 billion pledge expiring this year. The Caspian Sea nation, often proud of being home to the world's first oil wells, will also be under pressure to show progress from last year's COP28 pledge to transition away from fossil fuels. The country's oil and gas revenues accounted for 35% of its economy in 2023, down from 50% two years prior. The government says these revenues will continue to decline, to roughly 32% of its GDP this year and 22% by 2028. Before the summit talks can even begin, countries will need to agree on an agenda by consensus – including an 11th-hour proposal by China to bring trade disputes into the mix. The Chinese proposal - made on behalf of the fast-developing 'BASIC' group of countries including Brazil, India and South Africa - asked for the summit to address 'restrictive trade measures' such as the EU's carbon border tariffs going into effect in 2026. Those concerns have been compounded by Trump's campaign promise to impose 20% tariffs on all foreign goods – and 60% on Chinese goods. China's request showed it was flexing power following Trump's re-election, which signaled the United States' likely disengagement from global climate cooperation, said Li Shuo, director of China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the global treaty to reduce planet-warming emissions. The European Union, along with current U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, have been pressing China and Gulf oil nations to join the pool of climate finance donor countries. 'If the EU wants to talk about climate finance with China, if it wants to talk NDCs, part of the conversation should be how to resolve our differences on trade and your tariffs,' Shuo said. Extreme pressure With this year on track to be the hottest on record, experts noted that climate extremes were now challenging rich and poor countries alike – from flooding disasters in Africa, coastal Spain and the U.S. state of North Carolina, to drought gripping South America, Mexico and the U.S. West. Most countries are not prepared. 'Election results don't alter the laws of physics,' said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. 'Unless the world collectively steps up its efforts, the impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe and frequent and will be felt by an increasing number of people in all countries, including in the United States.' Many in Baku were worried that a U.S. disengagement could lead other countries to backpedal on past climate pledges or to scale back future ambitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-trade-worries-cloud-cop29-climate-summit-in-azerbaijan/7859394.html	2024-11-10T22:35:24-08:00	
Taiwan businessman Tsao to sue Chinese officials over sanctions	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese businessman Robert Tsao said on Monday he would sue in a Taiwan court senior Chinese officials over sanctions they had placed on him, saying he was seeking to counter China's intimidation of lawful activity. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, last month said it would punish and sanction Tsao, the retired founder of chipmaker UMC, for alleged criminal and pro-Taiwan independence activities. China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the 'Black Bear Academy' that Tsao has helped fund was seeking to incite separatism that would endanger cross-strait ties. Tsao, one of Taiwan's richest men who has pledged to provide millions to two civilian defense training programs, told a press conference that China was threatening the lawful holding of political views in Taiwan, and his personal safety. The lawsuit will be lodged in a Taipei court against Song Tao, head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and also the office's spokesperson Chen Binhua. Taiwan courts have no jurisdiction in China and senior Chinese officials do not visit the island. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. Cheng Wen-lung, one of Tsao's lawyers, said they understood that neither Song nor Chen would come to Taiwan and there would be no way of enforcing any judgment, but the case was about sending a message to Beijing, given it has been seeking to use legal means to put pressure on Taiwanese persons it does not like. 'Legally, we have to do this,' Cheng said. 'Taiwan is in a difficult spot, but we have to work hard. You cannot not do anything.' Tsao's team is also looking at suing in a U.S. court under that country's Alien Tort Claims Act. China's announcement against Tsao came as the country's military staged a day of war games around Taiwan it said were a warning to 'separatist acts.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims. UMC says Tsao has nothing to do with the company any longer having retired a decade ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-businessman-tsao-to-sue-chinese-officials-over-sanctions/7859378.html	2024-11-10T21:23:02-08:00	
China clamps down on quest for soup dumplings by 'Night Riding Army'	BEIJING — Police in central China imposed traffic curbs at the weekend to halt a viral craze in which thousands of university students borrowed shared bikes to ride overnight to the city of Kaifeng in search of breakfast. The 'Night Riding Army,' as some participants described it, clogged a highway on Friday, pictures posted on social media showed, a surge in turnout for a rolling flash mob that had been gathering riders for months. 'Last night's 'Night Riding Army' was spectacular!' one rider posted. 'Two lanes were opened, but that simply was not enough: The cycling army accounted for four!' The event was part of a trend of young Chinese traveling on the cheap - 'like special forces' - and spending as little as possible at a time of scarce job prospects, when wages are under pressure. The riders traveled on a straight road more than 60 km (37 miles) long beside the Yellow River that links Zhengzhou, the largest city in Henan province, with Kaifeng, an ancient capital famed for its soup dumplings. The trend was set off in June, Chinese media said, after four women college students chronicled their ride on social media to eat dumplings in the morning. 'The Night Ride to Kaifeng: Youth is priceless, enjoy it in time,' was the hashtag on social media for the ride, which state broadcaster CMG said tens of thousands of students had completed by the weekend. Key to its success was a glut of shared bikes, which can be rented for as little as $1.95 a month. Pictures posted by riders showed thousands of the bikes had overrun downtown Kaifeng by Saturday. In addition to the traffic controls, the largest bike-sharing platforms, Hellobike, DiDi Bike, and Mobile, said their vehicles would lock down if ridden out of a designated zone, while media told the students to grow up. 'Youthful freedom does not mean following the trend and indulging oneself,' one news outlet admonished in a comment. 'Kaifeng is worth arriving slowly and savoring carefully,' read the headline of another. Chinese authorities have cracked down on other spontaneous gatherings. Last month, police turned out in force in the commercial hub of Shanghai to deter a repeat of 2023 Halloween celebrations in which some revelers wore costumes poking fun at issues such as the stock market, youth unemployment and tough COVID-19 curbs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-clamps-down-on-quest-for-soup-dumplings-by-night-riding-army-/7859376.html	2024-11-10T21:08:46-08:00	
Storm-weary Philippines evacuates thousands as another typhoon hits	MANILA, Philippines — A new typhoon barreled across an agricultural region in the northeastern Philippines on Monday after thousands were evacuated to safety while still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by three successive storms in the last three weeks. Typhoon Toraji slammed into northeastern Aurora province and was forecast to blow over the mountainous Luzon region, where President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. — just the day before — inspected the damage from the last storm and led the distribution of food packs to residents in Cagayan and Ilocos provinces. Marcos skipped this week's Asia-Pacific Cooperation forum in Peru to oversee recovery efforts from back-to-back storms. After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides. With the typhoon approaching fast, there was little time to move large numbers of people to safety, he said. 'We understand if some would want to stay, but we have to get them out,' Remulla told reporters. The military said its disaster-response forces have been deployed near high-risk areas and were standing by for new contingencies. It added that it suspended combat drills in the north due to the weather. 'Our commitment remains steadfast in safeguarding and assisting our countrymen specially in times of disaster,' Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said. Schools were shut down, inter-island ferry services and domestic flights were suspended in provinces in or near the path of the typhoon, the 14th weather disturbance to batter the Philippine archipelago this year. Forecasters said they were monitoring another brewing storm in the Pacific that could affect the country if it strengthens. The last two typhoons and a tropical storm caused more than 160 deaths, damaged thousands of houses and farmlands and affected more than 9 million people, including hundreds of thousands who fled to emergency shelters, after dumping from one to two months' worth of rain in just 24 hours in some cities and towns. Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces. The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-weary-philippines-evacuates-thousands-as-another-typhoon-hits/7859360.html	2024-11-10T19:32:53-08:00	
USAID teaches Ukrainian women veterans yachting	For many soldiers on the front lines, the trauma of war can be as hard to fight as the war itself. To help, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has created a program to support Ukrainian women veterans, the families of internally displaced persons, and military relatives. The program is part of the USAID Self-Reliance Learning Agenda. Anna Kosstutschenko has the story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/usaid-teaches-ukrainian-women-veterans-yachting-/7859335.html	2024-11-10T18:39:14-08:00	
Trump pressures candidates for Senate Republican leader to fill Cabinet quickly	WASHINGTON — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote. Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader. Trump has not endorsed any candidate in the race, but Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader 'must agree' to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote. 'Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,' Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled 'IMMEDIATELY!' The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president's power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief 'pro-forma' sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed. But with Trump's approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, '100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.' And Thune said in a statement that they must 'quickly and decisively' act to get nominees in place and that 'all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.' Cornyn said that 'It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.' He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution. The social media exchange Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term. Trump's relationship with Congress — especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections. Trump also posted Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold most of the votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that 'Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.' With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux. Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of Trump's and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump's endorsement. Senators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump's ear. 'We have to be the change,' Scott said on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures.' 'That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.' All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a 'despicable human being' behind closed doors. As the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump's Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC's 'This Week' that there are 'a couple of great options on the table.' Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS's 'Face the Nation' that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance 'the positions that President Trump has articulated.' 'I'll do that in whatever role necessary,' said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race. While Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions. Trump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the Republican nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,' Trump posted on his network Truth Social. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to 'keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration.' 'The 'stop Pompeo' movement is great, but it's not enough,' Smith posted on X. 'America First: screw the war machine!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pressures-candidates-for-senate-republican-leader-to-fill-cabinet-quickly/7859325.html	2024-11-10T17:36:58-08:00	
15 Chad soldiers killed in operation against Boko Haram, army says	N'DJAMENA, CHAD — At least 15 Chadian soldiers were killed and 32 others wounded in clashes between the army and Boko Haram fighters Saturday, the army's spokesperson said, adding that 96 Boko Haram members were also killed. General Issakh Acheikh on Sunday did not say where the operation took place or provide any details on the circumstances. He said on national television that the army also wounded 11 Boko Haram members and seized arms and equipment. 'The army assures the population that the situation is under control and that actions to track down residual elements continue as part of Operation Haskanite,' Acheikh said, referring to a military operation launched to dislodge Boko Haram militants from Lake Chad. The region has been attacked repeatedly by insurgencies including Islamic State in West Africa and Boko Haram, which erupted in northeast Nigeria in 2009 and spread to the west of Chad. Around 40 soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Chad's Lake region at the end of last month, after which interim President Mahamat Idriss Deby threatened to withdraw the Central African country from a multinational security force. Chad is an important ally for French and U.S. forces seeking to help fight a 12-year jihadi insurgency in West Africa's Sahel region. Military juntas that seized power in recent years in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — whose shared borders have become epicenters of jihadi violence — have turned their backs on the West in favor of Russian support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-soldiers-killed-in-operation-against-boko-haram-army-says/7859312.html	2024-11-10T16:54:04-08:00	
Taylor Swift wins big and Rita Ora pays tribute to Liam Payne at MTV awards	Manchester, England — Taylor Swift came out top at the 2024 MTV EMAs on Sunday, walking away with best artist, best U.S. act, best live act and best video for 'Fortnight' (featuring Post Malone). Swift, who is currently finishing up her Eras tour on the other side of the Atlantic, thanked the fans for the bounty of prizes via video message. The U.K. show opened with an acrobatic Benson Boone suspended in the air on a gold grand piano performing his viral hit 'Beautiful Things' and latest release 'Slow it Down.' Boone also accepted his first EMA for best new act. South African newcomer Tyla gave Swift a run for her money picking up three awards for best afrobeats, best R&B and best African act. Tyla performed her smash hit 'Water' for the EMA audience at the Co-op Live, Manchester, flanked by a host of dancers, as well as singing energetic new track 'Push 2 Start.' British singer Rita Ora, who hosted the show for a record third time, paid tribute to former One Direction star Liam Payne, who died last month after falling from a balcony in Buenos Aires. Ora had a close relationship with the singer and the pair recorded a song together in 2018, 'For You (Fifty Shades Freed).' She addressed the audience saying, 'I want to take a moment to remember someone. Liam Payne was one of the kindest people I knew.' Her voice broke as she asked the crowd to take a moment to remember Liam saying, 'He had the biggest heart and he left such a mark on this world.' Hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes was awarded the EMAs global icon award from British rapper Little Simz telling the crowd that in 34 years of professionally recording this was his first award from MTV and it felt incredible. The 12-time Grammy Award nominee, who has more than 10 million album sales under his belt, performed a mega medley of his greatest hits 'Break ya Neck,' 'Touch it' and 'Put Your Hands Where the Eyes can See' accompanied by dancers wearing tracksuits with giant dragon heads. Shawn Mendes gave an intimate and heartfelt performance and also received the award for best Canadian act. Sabrina Carpenter picked up the honors for best song for her hit 'Espresso,' while Ariana Grande was crowned best pop act and Eminem took away best hip hop act. U.K. duo Pet Shop Boys were honored with the inaugural Pop Pioneers Award for their contribution to pop music and closed out the show accompanied by local orchestra Manchester Camerata with a cover of David Bowie's 'All the Young Dudes' followed by their iconic hit 'West End Girls' in celebration of the song's 40th anniversary. Other performers on the night included K-Pop quintet Le Sserafim, Mexican singer and rapper Peso Pluma, English singer and songwriter Raye, multi-platinum singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes, American powerhouse Teddy Swims, Mexican rock sisters the Warning. LL Cool J, Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale, mother-and-daughter musicians Neneh Cherry and Mabel and TV and film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Turner-Smith and Lucien Laviscount all presented awards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taylor-swift-wins-big-and-rita-ora-pays-tribute-to-liam-payne-at-mtv-awards/7859296.html	2024-11-10T16:12:10-08:00	
UK's Starmer, France's Macron to discuss Ukraine support after Trump win	London — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to discuss ways to help Ukraine, after the election of Donald Trump has raised concerns of reduced U.S. support for the war against Russia. Days after Trump was elected to begin a second term as U.S. president in January, Starmer will travel to France, where he will talk with Macron and become the first British leader to attend French Armistice Day services since World War Two. Starmer and Macron will discuss 'Russia's ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine and the appalling humanitarian situation in Gaza,' Downing Street said. Trump has criticized the level of U.S. support for Ukraine's fight against Russia since the 2022 full-scale invasion and has promised to end the conflict without explaining how. Britain and France have said it is essential to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia to protect the European continent. Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to Ukraine, allocating 118 billion euros ($126 billion) since the start of the conflict, while the United States has provided 85 billion euros ($91 billion) in total, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Britain and the European Union are expected to begin talks next year on a post-Brexit security pact, covering areas such as defense and energy cooperation, as they look to take more responsibility for their own security. Some European politicians have said Europe cannot replace the financial and military aid from the United States, including military resources such as F-16 fighter jets and Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). On his visit to France, Starmer is scheduled to meet the new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The meeting will be their first since Barnier became prime minister in September. The last British leader to attend the French Armistice Day commemorations was Winston Churchill, who was hosted by Charles de Gaulle in 1944, Starmer's office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-france-s-macron-to-discuss-ukraine-support-after-trump-win/7859035.html	2024-11-10T15:59:25-08:00	
1 dead, 16 hurt after shooting at Alabama’s Tuskegee University	Atlanta, Georgia — A shooting early Sunday that marred homecoming weekend at Tuskegee University in Alabama left one person dead and left 16 others injured, a dozen of them by gunfire, authorities said. One arrest was announced hours later. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion device. The agency's statement said Myrick faces a federal charge of possession of a machine gun. It did not say whether he was a student at the historically Black university, where the shooting erupted in the early hours on Sunday as the school's 100th Homecoming Week was winding down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university student but that some of the injured were students. It was not immediately known if Myrick had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Twelve people were wounded by gunfire, and four others sustained injuries not related to the gunshots, the state agency said earlier. Their conditions were not immediately released. The FBI joined the investigation and said it is seeking tips from the public, as well as any video witnesses might have. It set up a site online for people to upload video. Tuskegee University announced that classes Monday have been canceled. Grief counselors will be available to help students in the university's chapel. The parents of the victim were notified, and several of the injured were being treated at East Alabama Medical Center in Opelika and Baptist South Hospital in Montgomery, the university said in a statement. An autopsy on the 18-year-old was planned at the state's forensic center in Montgomery, Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley told The Associated Press on Sunday. Tuskegee city's police chief, Patrick Mardis, said the injured included a female student who was shot in the stomach and a male student who was shot in the arm. City police were responding to an unrelated double shooting off campus when officers got the call about the university shooting at the West Commons on-campus apartments, Mardis said. 'Some idiots started shooting,' Mardis told the news site Al.com. 'You couldn't get the emergency vehicles in there, there were so many people there.' A person who answered the phone at the office of Tuskegee's police chief said no other information was available. 'Special Agents are still in the process of gathering and examining information relative to the sequence of events which ultimately led to the shooting,' the state law enforcement agency said in a statement. In his 37 years as coroner, Bentley said he couldn't recall any shootings during the school's past homecoming celebrations. The mood around the small town of around 9,000 people was somber, he said. The shooting left everyone in the university community shaken, said Amare' Hardee, a senior from Tallahassee, Florida, who is president of the student government association. 'This senseless act of violence has touched each of us, whether directly or indirectly,' he said at the school's homecoming convocation Sunday morning. A pastor who leads the Tuskegee National Alumni Association told those at Sunday's convocation service that the shooting is a reminder of the fragility of life. 'It is in moments like these that we need to be reminded not to stand on our own understanding because in a moment like this, I don't have understanding,' said the Rev. James Quincy III. 'I can only rely on my faith, and my prayer for our entire family, this community, as we close out this marvelous family reunion that we shared this week,' Quincy said, 'and most importantly because of that faith walk and that trust in God, that we have resilience, resilience in the time of trouble.' Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama — the school's opponent for Tuskegee's homecoming football game on Saturday — released a statement expressing sympathy. 'Today, our hearts are with the Tuskegee family as they face the tragic aftermath of the recent shooting on campus,' the college said. 'We extend our deepest condolences to those impacted and pray for healing and justice. Miles College stands with you in this difficult time.' Sunday's shooting comes just over a year after four people were injured in a shooting at a Tuskegee University student housing complex. In that shooting, two visitors to the campus were shot and two students were hurt while trying to leave the scene of what campus officials described as an 'unauthorized party' in September 2023, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. About 3,000 students are enrolled at the university about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Alabama's capital city of Montgomery. The university was the first historically Black college to be designated as a Registered National Landmark in 1966. It was also designated a National Historic Site in 1974, according to the school's website. Norma Clayton, chairwoman of the board of the trustees, said at the Sunday morning service that 'we will get through this together because in tough times, tough people band together and they survive.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/shooting-alabama-tuskegee-university/7859031.html	2024-11-10T15:43:09-08:00	
Olaf Scholz signals willingness for earlier German confidence vote	Berlin — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that he would be willing to call a vote of confidence in parliament before Christmas, a move that would pave the way for snap elections following the collapse of his three-way governing coalition. The timing is earlier than the January date he had proposed last week and follows increasing pressure from politicians and the public for a quicker vote. Europe's largest economy was thrown into disarray last week with the collapse of Scholz's coalition and disagreements over how much money the government should spend to encourage growth and support Ukraine. 'I'm not clinging to my job,' he said in an interview on ARD television. Scholz had suggested holding a vote of confidence in his government on Jan. 15, with a snap election in March, but the conservative opposition led by Friedrich Merz wants an election in January. A confidence vote is a necessary precursor to an election. Earlier Sunday, Scholz came under increasing pressure to bring forward the vote of confidence. Two leading members of the Green party, which is sharing power with Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) in a minority government, told Bild newspaper that the confidence vote should be held in December. The Green party's Anton Hofreiter and Irene Mihalic were the most prominent voices so far from the two parties still in power to back an earlier vote. Scholz said in the ARD interview that an earlier confidence vote would depend on SPD party official Rolf Mutzenich and the opposition's Merz reaching an agreement on timing. 'It is not a problem at all for me to call a vote of confidence before Christmas,' he said. Scholz on Friday demanded a calm debate among Germany's squabbling factions on setting a date for the snap election to pull the country out of its political crisis. Scholz called on parties to first agree on what legislation could be passed in what remained of the current parliament but denied trying to ram through his own policy agenda by delaying an election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/olaf-scholz-signals-willingness-for-earlier-german-confidence-vote/7859025.html	2024-11-10T14:55:10-08:00	
Australian gold company confirms arrest of CEO, 2 executives in Mali	Dakar, Senagal — The CEO and two executives of Australian gold mine Resolute in Mali have been arrested while in Bamako to discuss ongoing disputes with authorities, the company confirmed Sunday. CEO Terence Holohan and his two colleagues 'were in Bamako to discuss with mining and tax authorities the company's business practices in Mali generally and to make progress on ongoing claims against Resolute, which continues to claim they are unfounded,' Resolute said in a statement posted on its website. 'Unexpectedly, the three employees were arrested after the end of these meetings on Friday,' she reported. The three executives were taken the same day to the unit specializing in the fight against corruption and economic and financial delinquency — and were placed in police custody in a case of alleged forgery and damage to public property, AFP learned Saturday from a judicial and industrial source. Four employees of the Canadian company Barrick Gold, also in dispute with the Malian authorities, were detained for several days at the end of September, then released. Foreign mining companies are subject to increased pressure from the junta that came to power by force in 2020 and pays particular attention to the juicy revenues of the mining industry. 'Resolute is working to reach an agreement with the Malian government that secures the long-term future of the Syama gold mine; at the same time its top priority remains the safety and well-being of its employees,' the company said. The executives benefit from the support of the embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom and other countries present in Mali, she said. Resolute holds 80% of the shares in the subsidiary that owns the Syama mine, with the remaining 20% in the hands of the Malian state, according to the company's website. The Malian authorities have made the fight against corruption and the restoration of national sovereignty over natural resources their mantras. Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, faces jihadis and a multidimensional crisis, and is also one of the leading gold producers in Africa. Gold contributes to a quarter of the national budget and three quarters of export revenues. The increased pressure on foreign companies coincided with the junta's strategic pivot toward Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-gold-company-confirms-arrest-of-ceo-2-executives-in-mali/7859017.html	2024-11-10T14:31:05-08:00	
Haiti replaces PM, marking more turmoil in its democratic transition process	A transitionary council created to reestablish democratic order in Haiti signed a degree Sunday firing interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and replacing him with Alix Didier Fils-Aime, a businessman who was previously considered for the job. The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn't held democratic elections in years in large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation. The transitional council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti's next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil in Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and in October a number of members on the council faced corruption accusations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-replaces-pm-marking-more-turmoil-in-its-democratic-transition-process/7859012.html	2024-11-10T14:11:50-08:00	
Biden to lobby Trump not to walk away from Ukraine	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss top domestic and foreign policy priorities with President-elect Donald Trump when the two meet Wednesday, and will urge him not to abandon Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Republican Trump will take office on Jan. 20 after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, the White House said. In an interview on CBS News' 'Face the Nation' show, Sullivan said Biden's top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and he will also talk to Trump about what's happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East. 'The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand, and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office,' Sullivan said. While Sullivan did not specify which topics the two would discuss, their conversation will almost certainly feature Ukraine's war with Russia, which Trump has pledged to end swiftly, although he did not say how. 'President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,' Sullivan said. When asked if that means Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred. 'I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,' Sullivan said. Ukraine funding Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February of 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers. Sullivan's comments came as Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 34 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war. Trump insisted last year that Russian President Vladimir Putin never would have invaded Ukraine if he had been in the White House at the time. He told Reuters Ukraine may have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something the Ukrainians reject, and Biden has never suggested. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday he was not aware of any details of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to end the Ukraine war quickly and that he was convinced a rapid end would entail major concessions for Kyiv. According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of the aid is almost sure to drop under Trump with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 52-seat majority. Control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress is not yet clear with some votes still being counted. Republicans have won 213 seats, according to Edison Research, just shy of the 218 needed for a majority. If Republicans win both chambers, it will mean most of Trump's agenda will have a significantly easier time passing through Congress. Republican U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Trump ally who is considered a top contender for secretary of state, criticized U.S. funding for Ukraine in a CBS interview. 'The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation,' Hagerty said. The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war. Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war. Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-lobby-trump-not-to-walk-away-from-ukraine/7859007.html	2024-11-10T14:03:53-08:00	
As Russian forces close in on Kurakhove, hundreds of residents remain in front-line city	KURAKHOVE, Ukraine — Set on Ukraine's eastern front, Kurakhove is surrounded on three sides, with Russian forces just under 3 kilometers from the devastated city center. Yet between 700 and 1,000 local residents remain, most of them living in the basements of apartment buildings, without running water, heating or electricity. The only place to charge phones is in the basement of the building now housing the city administration. The exact number of people is impossible to determine because, since mid-October, no humanitarian volunteers have come to Kurakhove. Under attack from artillery, multiple rocket launchers, aerial bombs and drones, Kurakhove has become the new Bakhmut, as Russia continues its drive westward to capture all of the Donbas region. On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the situation in Kurakhove, as well as the key city of Pokrovsk, 'the most challenging.' The hospital, schools, kindergartens, water treatment plant, refugee center, post office, technical school and cultural center have all been destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air as bombed-out apartment buildings burn against a backdrop of artillery fire and drones. Artillerymen of the 33rd Brigade say they are firing around 50 shells per day on the Kurakhove front, indicating critical activity in the Russian army's offensive operations and the brigade's desperate attempts to stop Russian forces from encircling the city. Local authorities remain in the city, as well as representatives of the police and local Territorial Defense Forces. For Artem Shchus, head of police in Kurakhove, there is little hope of defending the city if it becomes surrounded. 'I don't think it is possible, considering the reality of modern war and modern technologies. In that case, the logistics could be performed only by drones,' he says. Shchus calls the road to Kurakhove, which is lined with burned-out civilian vehicles, the 'road of death,' due to persistent Russian drone attacks. Five civilians have been killed while trying to leave. The road of death No supplies would enter the city without the 'White Angels' evacuation group, made up of local police officers and volunteers. They provide first aid to the wounded and remove the bodies of those killed in shelling, all while operating the city's only functioning food store. The White Angels bring in vital supplies in an armored vehicle kitted out with electronic warfare equipment — the only way to enter the city, and still a journey fraught with risk. 'Without REB (jammers) it is just a lottery. With it, you might still have a chance to survive,' Shchus says. The only way to escape the city is to travel with the White Angels. Each day, they risk their lives to evacuate between six and 12 people from different parts of the city and surrounding villages. Although children are meant to have been evacuated, parents often hide them, both from the bombs and from law enforcement officers. Among the White Angels' key missions is to find children and persuade their parents to evacuate. When this mission is successful and children are removed from the basements, many are shocked by the state of the destroyed city, suggesting that they have been hiding underground for quite some time. After dressing the children in bulletproof vests and helmets, the White Angels take them to the nearby city of Kostiantynopil, from where other volunteers transport them to refugee registration points in the regional centers of Dnipro or Zaporizhzhia. 'We evacuate people every day without stopping. We just dropped people off in Kostiantynopil, and we still have addresses to go through today,' Shchus explains. Asked about adapting to work in such challenging and dangerous conditions, the police chief worries about the impact on his team. 'I think everyone has already adapted. I wouldn't even call it 'adaptation.' It's more like an unhealthy state of mind. I don't know how this will influence them socially in the future,' he says. 'These people are living in inhumane conditions, and they're surviving on adrenaline. The war is their life. These are hard conditions to work in, but everyone is working.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-russian-forces-close-in-on-kurakhove-hundreds-of-residents-remain-in-front-line-city/7859008.html	2024-11-10T14:02:29-08:00	
China delimits contested South China Sea shoal in dispute with Philippines	Beijing — China has published baselines for a contested shoal in the South China Sea it seized from the Philippines, a move that's likely to increase tensions over overlapping territorial claims. The Foreign Ministry on Sunday posted online geographic coordinates for the baselines around Scarborough Shoal. A nation's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone are typically defined as the distance from the baselines. Both China and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal and other outcroppings in the South China Sea. China seized the shoal, which lies west of the main Philippine island of Luzon, in 2012 and has since restricted access to Filipino fishermen there. A 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid but Beijing refuses to abide by it. Ships from China and the Philippines have collided several times as part of increased confrontations, and the Chinese coast guard has blasted Philippine vessels with water cannons. China's move came two days after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed two laws demarcating the government's claims in the disputed waters. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said that the delimiting of the baselines was in accordance with a U.N. agreement and Chinese law. 'This is a natural step by the Chinese government to lawfully strengthen marine management and is consistent with international law and common practices,' it said. The statement added that one of the laws signed by Marcos, the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, violates China's sovereignty in the South China Sea. 'China firmly opposes it and will continue to do everything necessary in accordance with law to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,' the Foreign Ministry said. China stakes claim to almost the entirety of the South China Sea. It has a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian nations including the Philippines and Vietnam over territory in the waters, which are part of a key shipping route in Asia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-delimits-contested-south-china-sea-shoal-in-dispute-with-philippines/7859002.html	2024-11-10T13:54:08-08:00	
California farmers enjoy pistachio boom, with much of it headed to China	Lost Hills, California — In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world. Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world's top exporter of the nut. 'There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,' said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. 'You are starting to see the fruit of people's vision from 40 years ago.' California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows. Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during the Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted. The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards. Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be prepped for sale. 'There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,' Yraceburu said. 'The world wants more.' Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said. Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said. Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out. Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said. The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California. Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center. But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said. When farmers decide what to plant, 'I think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,' Franklin said. 'And water is right below that.' Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production. But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Magana, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California. Pistachios require about 3,700 cubic meters (3 acre-feet) of water per 0.4 hectares (acre) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said. 'You see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,' Magana said. 'I haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-farmers-enjoy-pistachio-boom-with-much-of-it-headed-to-china/7858996.html	2024-11-10T13:31:04-08:00	
Saudi armed forces chief of staff in Iran for talks with officials	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — The chief of staff of Saudi Arabia's armed forces, Fayyad al-Ruwaili, visited Tehran on Sunday to meet with his Iranian counterpart and discuss defense ties, state media reported the Iranian Armed Forces General Staff as saying. The visit follows the election of Donald Trump, who will take office for a second term as U.S. president in January, and who has promised to bring peace to the Middle East. During his first term, Trump initiated normalizations between Arab states and Iran's regional arch-enemy Israel, known as the Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia has not established ties with Israel, but Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has discussed the possibility with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman multiple times over the last years, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Iran's state media said al-Ruwaili headed a high-level Saudi military delegation in Tehran and met Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri. Iranian state media said the two military officials discussed various issues, including 'the development of defense diplomacy and the expansion of bilateral cooperation.' State media added that Bagheri held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud last year to discuss regional developments and improve defense cooperation between the two countries. Separately, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the phone, Iranian media said. Pezeshkian told the crown prince he would not be able to attend a summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Riyadh due to his busy schedule and would be dispatching the Iranian first vice president as a representative, the Mehr news agency said. Tehran and Riyadh agreed in March 2023, via Chinese intermediation, to reestablish relations after seven years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf and helped to fuel conflicts in the Middle East from Yemen to Syria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-armed-forces-chief-of-staff-in-iran-for-talks-with-officials/7858992.html	2024-11-10T13:23:46-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes kill dozens in Lebanon, Gaza	Israeli airstrikes killed dozens of people in Lebanon and northern Gaza on Sunday, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have been discussing the way forward for when Trump takes office in January. The Israeli leader said he has spoken with Trump three times since the U.S. presidential election last week and that they 'see eye-to-eye on the Iranian threat in all its aspects, and on the dangers they reflect.' Netanyahu said he sees 'great opportunities facing Israel, in the area of peace and its expansion,' but did not expand on his statement. Before the election, Trump, according to Israeli news accounts, told Netanyahu that he wanted Israel to resolve its wars against two Iranian-supported groups, Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, before his inauguration as president on January 20. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to meet with outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday in Washington as the mid-month deadline approaches for Israel to meet a Biden administration ultimatum that it allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to assist Palestinians or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby northern Gaza towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Experts from a panel that monitors food security say famine is imminent or may already be happening. In the Sunday fighting, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people, including seven children, in Aalmat village north of Beirut, far from the areas in the east and south where Hezbollah militants have a major presence. Lebanon's health ministry said another six people were wounded. Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi: There was no Israeli evacuation warning and no immediate Israeli comment on the attack. In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people including nine women, according to Dr. Fadel Naim, director of Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City. The Israeli military, without offering evidence, said it had targeted a site where militants were operating. It said the details of the strike are under review. A separate strike hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense first responders who operate under the government. In Syria, the state news agency SANA said an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, killing seven civilians. The Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, suggested Hezbollah was targeted, but Israel did not offer any immediate comment. The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting about 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, although about one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas militants. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrikes-kill-dozens-in-lebanon-gaza/7858985.html	2024-11-10T13:11:30-08:00	
China, Indonesia seal $10 billion in deals focused on green energy and tech	Beijing — China and Indonesia signed deals worth $10 billion at the Indonesia-China Business Forum in Beijing on Sunday, spanning sectors including food, new energy, technology, and biotechnology, Chinese state media reported. The forum followed a meeting on Saturday between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who was in China through Sunday, the first country he has visited since taking office last month. Prabowo, who won Indonesia's presidential election in February, also chose China for his first visit as president-elect, underscoring Jakarta's commitment to stronger strategic ties with Beijing. In a joint statement after the leaders' meeting, the countries agreed to enhance collaboration in sectors such as new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, photovoltaics, and the digital economy. They also pledged to strengthen partnership on the global energy transition and jointly ensure the security of global mineral supply and industrial chains, the statement said. Prabowo, in a separate statement, said he was optimistic close cooperation between the two countries would improve regional stability. 'We must set an example that in this era, cooperation not confrontation is the path to peace and prosperity,' Prabowo said, adding Indonesia was committed to supporting Chinese investors. On Sunday, Chinese battery materials producer GEM signed a deal with PT Vale Indonesia to build a high-pressure acid leaching plant in central Sulawesi, partly to secure nickel resources, a Shenzhen filing showed. Prabowo witnessed the signing. The nickel industry in Indonesia, the world's largest producer of the metal, is dominated by Chinese companies including Tsingshan Holding Group and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. In the tech sector, Indonesian tech firm GoTo Gojek Tokopedia signed agreements with China's Tencent and Alibaba to develop cloud infrastructure and digital talent in Indonesia, Reuters reported earlier. The two countries will introduce visa measures, including multi-entry long-term visas, and encourage more direct flights and destinations based on demand, the joint statement showed. Other cooperation agreements signed during Prabowo's visit include collaboration in housing and the export of fresh coconuts from Indonesia to China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-indonesia-seal-10-billion-in-deals-focused-on-green-energy-and-tech/7858988.html	2024-11-10T13:08:55-08:00	
NY parks employee dies fighting fires; air quality warnings are issued in New York and New Jersey	POMPTON LAKES, N.J. — A New York parks employee died battling one of a number of wildfires in New Jersey and New York amid dry conditions that have prompted air quality warnings in both states, authorities said Sunday. The worker died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire along the New York-New Jersey border, according to reports from the Eastern Dutchess County Fire and Rescue and the New York state forestry services. 'Rip brother your shift is over job well done,' the New York State forestry services post said. New York State Police said they were investigating the death amid the fire in Sterling Forest located in Greenwood Lake and identified the victim as Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state Parks and Recreation aide employed by the New York State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department. The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 10 square kilometers near the border in Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 70-hectare fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 142-hectare Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of 'incendiary or tracer ammunition' was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 81 hectares in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 8.8 square kilometers in the city 16 kilometers north of Boston. 'This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,' the Lynn Fire Department said in a statement on social media as firefighters continued to battle the blaze, blaming its intensely on low humidity as well as winds and dry leaves on the ground. It was one of many brush fires that cropped up across the region. In Foxborough, fire crews said that containing a wildfire at the F. Gilbert Hills State Forest would be a 'a multi-day event.' Wind gusts topped 64 kph on Saturday, and less-powerful gusts continued Sunday. Firefighters and forest agencies warned against outdoor burning. The drier-than-normal weather is expected to continue, and virtually all of New England is categorized as being in drought or being abnormally dry. Most of the region was expected to see some light rain Sunday night, but there are no large rainfall events in the forecast, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jerry Combs. Firefighters in California were also battling a scattering of blazes over the weekend, including one north of Los Angeles that had burned more than 100 structures. Evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County, where the Mountain Fire held at about 83 square kilometers and was 26% contained, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ny-parks-employee-dies-fighting-fires-air-quality-warnings-are-issued-in-new-york-and-new-jersey/7858960.html	2024-11-10T11:43:15-08:00	
Iran says militant attack on Pakistani border leaves 5 security forces dead	Tehran, Iran — A militant attack near the Pakistani border with Iran left five Iranian forces dead, the state-run IRNA news agency reported Sunday. The report said the dead were ethnic Baluch members of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's volunteer Basij force and were killed in Saravan city in Sistan and Baluchistan province. Saravan is some 1,400 km (870 miles) southeast of the capital Tehran. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier in the day, state TV reported that Revolutionary Guard forces killed three terrorists and arrested nine others in a military operation. The report did not specify which group the suspects belonged to. Last month, unknown gunmen killed four people, including the chief of the Revolutionary Guard in the province. In September, gunmen killed four border guards in Sistan and Baluchistan province in two separate attacks. The militant group Jaish al-Adl, which seeks greater rights for the ethnic Baluch minority, claimed responsibility for one attack in which one officer and two soldiers were killed. The province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been the site of occasional deadly clashes involving militant groups, armed drug smugglers and Iranian security forces. It is one of the least developed parts of Iran. Relations between the predominantly Sunni Muslim residents of the region and Iran's Shiite theocracy have long been strained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-militant-attack-on-pakistani-border-leaves-5-security-forces-dead/7858958.html	2024-11-10T11:31:33-08:00	
6.8 magnitude earthquake shakes Cuba after hurricanes and blackouts	Havana — A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook eastern Cuba on Sunday, after weeks of hurricanes and blackouts that have left many on the island reeling. The epicenter of the quake was located approximately 40 km south of Bartolomé Masó, Cuba, according to a report by the United States Geological Survey. The rumbling was felt across the eastern stretch of Cuba, including in bigger cities like Santiago de Cuba. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Residents in Santiago, Cuba's second largest city, were left shaken on Sunday. Yolanda Tabío, 76, said people in the city flocked to the streets and were still nervously sitting in their doorways. She said she felt at least two aftershocks following the quake, but that among friends and family she hadn't heard of any damages. 'You had to see how everything was moving, the walls, everything,' she told The Associated Press. The earthquake comes during another tough stretch for Cuba. On Wednesday, Category 3 Hurricane Rafael ripped through western Cuba, with strong winds knocking out power island-wide, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing evacuations of hundreds of thousands of people. Days after, much of the island was still struggling without power. Weeks before in October, the island was also hit by a one-two punch. First, it was hit by island-wide blackouts stretching on for days, a product of the island's energy crisis. Shortly after, it was slapped by a powerful hurricane that struck the eastern part of the island and killed at least six people. The blackouts and wider discontent among many struggling to get by has stoked small protests across the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/magnitude-earthquake-shakes-cuba-after-hurricanes-and-blackouts-/7858936.html	2024-11-10T10:32:36-08:00

Donald Trump’s US presidential victory was sweeping	Washington — In the end, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s 2024 national election for a new four-year presidential term in the White House was sweeping. Ahead of the Nov. 5 election, national polling showed Vice President Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Trump, maybe a percentage point or two, depending on the survey. Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, a Republican, were virtually deadlocked, the surveys indicated, in seven political battleground states that election analysts viewed as critical to the election outcome. Trump, however, captured all seven states, leading to his lopsided edge in the state-by-state vote count in the Electoral College, 312 to 226, which determines the outcome of U.S. presidential elections. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. He won the seven battleground states by a range of just under 1% in Wisconsin to more than 6% in Arizona. On January 20, 2025, the 78-year-old Trump will take office as the country’s 47th president and the first president to win two nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. He is the oldest elected president in U.S. history. Trump also won the popular vote, the first Republican candidate to do so since former President George W. Bush in 2004. While the last ballots are still being counted, Trump already is the clear winner, capturing nearly 75 million votes so far to just under 71 million for Harris, a 50.5% to 47.9% edge for Trump. Trump’s 2024 vote tally was about the same as the 74 million he received in losing the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden, but the vote for Harris was about 10 million fewer than Biden received. U.S. pollsters often like to say their surveys are just a snapshot in time, and not necessarily predictive. But over Trump’s three runs for the presidency since 2016, his level of support has consistently been underestimated in polling, no matter how many times pollsters have tried to adjust their published results to account for a hidden Trump vote from people unwilling to tell even anonymous surveyors that, yes, when they went to polling centers or cast mail-in ballots, he was their choice. Exit polls showed that women voters favored Harris and men Trump. More educated voters went for Harris, while those without college degrees voted for Trump, but nearly two-thirds of Americans do not have a college degree. In amassing his majority vote, Trump cut into two traditional Democratic constituencies, Black and Latino voters. According to The Associated Press’ VoteCast survey of voters, 16% of Black voters supported Trump in 2024, double that from his 2020 campaign. In comparison, 83% of Black voters supported Kamala Harris, down from the 91% who supported Biden in 2020. Democrats also lost ground among Latino voters, with 56% voting for Harris in 2024 compared to 63% for Biden in 2020. Trump’s support grew from 35% four years ago to 42% this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-s-us-presidential-victory-was-sweeping-/7858897.html	2024-11-10T09:47:50-08:00	
Somalia insists Ethiopia not be part of new AU mission	A senior Somali official insisted Saturday that Ethiopia will not participate in a new African Union peacekeeping mission starting in January. The two nations remain deadlocked over a Memorandum of Understanding that Ethiopia signed with the breakaway region, Somaliland, earlier this year. 'I can say that Ethiopia is the only government we know of so far that will not participate in the new AU mission because it has violated our sovereignty and national unity,' Somalia Defense Minister Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said Saturday in a government-run television interview. African Union troops from several countries have been operating in Somalia since 2007. They started with the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) before changing the mission and its name on April 1, 2022, to the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS). Its mandate ends at the end of this year. For 17 years, the African Union mission helped Somalia combat al-Shabab, a violent extremist organization that threatened to overthrow the government and impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. The aim of past and upcoming missions is to hand over security responsibility to the Somali National Forces. The nation is preparing for a third peace support operation, set to begin January 1, 2025, when a new mission, the African Union Support Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM), replaces ATMIS. According to a United Nations report in August, ATMIS has been drawing down troops from about 20,000 to less than 13,000. The new mission is expected to number at least 12,000. AUSSOM is scheduled to operate until the end of 2028. It is not the first time Somalia has rejected the involvement of Ethiopian troops in a peacekeeping mission in the country. In August, Somalia Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said Ethiopian forces would only join AUSSOM once Addis Ababa withdraws from the MoU with Somaliland. Mogadishu, which sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia, has described the agreement as an assault on its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Analysts say Somalia’s repeated demands that Ethiopia withdraw from the MoU have fallen on deaf ears, which further alienates Somalia. Professor Sonkor Geyre, a former director of the defense ministry, said Somalia has a right to choose the countries it wants and rejects others. 'Somalia has national sovereign rights to exclude Ethiopia from the upcoming AU mission because it sees Ethiopia’s actions, including its MoU with Somaliland, as a national threat,' Geyre told VOA Somali. Last month, the leaders of Somalia, Eritrea, and Egypt signed a security cooperation deal seen as an anti-Ethiopia front, and Mogadishu has also boosted its military ties with Cairo, which has offered troops for the new AU mission. 'There is an ongoing procedure that we will share and announce when the time comes regarding the new governments that will join and the previous ones who will not be part of the new mission,' Nur, the defense minister, said. Under the current AU mission, at least 3,000 Ethiopian soldiers officially operate as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission fighting al-Shabab. Another 5,000 to 7,000 Ethiopian soldiers are stationed in several regions under a bilateral agreement. Other countries contributing to the current AU forces in Somalia include Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, and Uganda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-insists-ethiopia-not-be-part-of-new-au-mission-/7858887.html	2024-11-10T09:29:07-08:00	
Paris deploying extra police for France-Israel soccer match following Amsterdam violence	Paris — Paris police said Sunday that 4,000 officers and 1,600 stadium staff will be deployed for a France-Israel soccer match to ensure security in and around the stadium and on public transportation a week after violence against Israeli fans in Amsterdam. France and Israel are playing in a UEFA Nations League match Thursday. 'There's a context, tensions that make that match a high-risk event for us,' Paris police chief Laurent Nuñez said on French news broadcaster BFM TV, adding authorities 'won't tolerate' any violence. Nuñez said that 2,500 police officers would be deployed around the Stade de France stadium, north of the French capital, in addition to 1,500 others in Paris and on public transportation. 'There will be an anti-terrorist security perimeter around the stadium,' Nuñez said. Security checks will be 'reinforced,' he added, including with systematic pat-downs and bag searches. Nuñez said that French organizers have been in contact with Israeli authorities and security forces to prepare for the match. Israeli fans were assaulted last week after a soccer game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. On Sunday, Dutch police detained several people for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following the violence targeting Israeli fans, a local broadcaster reported. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau confirmed Friday that the France-Israel match would go ahead as planned. 'I think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,' he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the 'universal values' of sports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-deploying-extra-police-for-france-israel-soccer-match-following-amsterdam-violence-/7858875.html	2024-11-10T09:11:32-08:00	
Gunmen kill 10 in central Mexico bar attack	Mexico City — Gunmen in a truck pulled up to a bar in central Mexico and opened fire, killing 10 people, authorities said, in an area that had been spared the worst of the country's raging criminal violence. Security camera footage published by local media showed the perpetrators leaping from the vehicle and bursting into the venue as terrified customers fled or dived to the floor. The attack late Saturday on Los Cantaritos bar in Queretaro's downtown district left 10 people dead and at least seven injured, according to the city's public security department chief Juan Luis Ferrusca. 'Emergency services arrived at the scene and confirmed that at least four people armed with long weapons had arrived on board a pickup truck,' Ferrusca said in a video on social media. One suspect was detained and the vehicle used in the attack was found abandoned and set on fire, he said. The victims included three women, according to the Queretaro state prosecutor's office, which said forensic experts were examining the scene of the attack and the vehicle. Queretaro, the capital of Queretaro state, is considered one of the safer cities in Mexico, which has been plagued by years of drug cartel-related violence. 'The entire security system of Queretaro is mobilized to find the criminals' behind the attack, state governor Mauricio Kuri said on social media platform X. 'We will continue to shield our borders and maintain the security of our state,' he said, adding, 'Those responsible for this brutal act will be punished.' Queretaro, a city known more for its colonial architecture than for its crime, is around 200 kilometers northwest of Mexico City. Across Mexico, spiraling violence, much of it linked to drug trafficking and gangs, has seen more than 450,000 people murdered since 2006. Tackling the murders and kidnappings that are a daily occurrence is among the major challenges facing President Claudia Sheinbaum. The former Mexico City mayor, who became the country's first woman president on October 1, has ruled out declaring 'war' on drug cartels. Instead, she has pledged to continue her predecessor's strategy of using social policy to tackle crime at its roots, while also making better use of intelligence. The northwestern cartel stronghold of Sinaloa has seen a surge in violence since the July arrest of drug lord Ismael Zambada in the United States unleashed a wave of gang infighting. There has also been a spike in bloodshed in the southern state of Guerrero, the scene of long-running gang turf wars. Authorities said Thursday that the bodies of 11 people, including two minors, were found abandoned in a pickup truck in the state capital Chilpancingo. They were part of a group of 17 people -- reported to be traveling merchants -- who were declared missing last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-10-in-central-mexico-bar-attack/7858882.html	2024-11-10T09:04:34-08:00

Opponents of ousted Bangladesh ex-premier Sheikh Hasina foil attempts to hold rally in Dhaka	Dhaka — Rival political groups of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh's capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising. The rally in Dhaka by Hasina's party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990. The day is commemorated as 'democracy day.' In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, became the most powerful political figures in the country. On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina's main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place. Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina's supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina's party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina. Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party's headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina's supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally. Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader. The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks. Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances. The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina's fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina's opponents. The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia's party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina's party, while its other allies are also struggling. The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opponents-of-ousted-bangladesh-ex-premier-sheikh-hasina-foil-attempts-to-hold-rally-in-dhaka/7858817.html	2024-11-10T07:40:47-08:00	
Taliban delegation in Azerbaijan to make debut at UN climate summit	Islamabad — The Taliban in Afghanistan sent its representatives to Azerbaijan on Sunday to attend a major United Nations climate change conference, marking the first such participation since they seized power three years ago. State-run Afghan media reported that Muti-ul-Haq Khalis, head of the National Environmental Protection Agency, is leading the Taliban’s 'technical' delegation, which is expected to have observer status instead of full participation. The U.N. Climate Change Conference, commonly called COP29, is scheduled to start Monday in Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, and will run until November 22. The Taliban have been excluded from recent international climate change talks because no country has recognized them as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, nor have they been permitted to take the country’s seat at the U.N. General Assembly. Poverty-stricken Afghanistan is ranked as one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis. It has recently encountered severe weather-related disasters like flash floods and prolonged droughts. Flash flooding earlier this year killed more than 350 Afghans, damaging close to 8,000 homes and displacing more than 5,000 families besides destroying crops and agricultural land. U.N. agencies report that the recent extreme weather in Afghanistan exhibits all the signs of the escalating climate crisis. Taliban authorities have sought to participate in U.N. climate summits, arguing that their political isolation should not prevent them from joining international climate talks and discussing the challenges facing their country. Host Azerbaijan invited the Afghan environment agency officials to COP29 as observers, enabling them to 'potentially participate in periphery discussions and potentially hold bilateral meetings,' the Reuters news agency quoted a diplomatic source familiar with the matter as saying. The Taliban’s restrictions on the freedoms of Afghan women have primarily deterred the world from formally engaging with their government. They have prohibited girls from receiving an education beyond the sixth grade and suspended female students from universities since regaining control of Afghanistan in August 2021, when the United States and NATO troops left the country. The Islamist leaders have enacted laws requiring Afghan women to cover their bodies and faces in public. Additionally, these laws prohibit women from undertaking long road or air trips unless accompanied by a male guardian. The Taliban say their governance is in line with their interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia and reject international calls for reversing restrictions on women as an interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-delegation-in-azerbaijan-to-make-debut-at-un-climate-summit/7858784.html	2024-11-10T07:09:50-08:00	
Dozens arrested after defying Amsterdam protest ban	Amsterdam — Dutch police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters in Amsterdam on Sunday after they defied a demonstration ban, put in place in the wake of clashes between Israeli football fans and groups of youths. Earlier in the day, the Amsterdam District Court upheld a decision by the mayor to ban protests in the city, three days after it was rocked by violence between Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans and men on scooters in several areas of the city. But hundreds of protesters nevertheless gathered in the city's Dam square, holding up placards that said 'We want our streets back' and chanting 'Free Palestine,' an AFP correspondent saw. Police in riot gear moved in on the protesters in the afternoon, shortly after the court upheld the ban on protests. In attacks that sparked outrage around the world, Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters were briefly hospitalized after coming under assault following a match with the local Ajax team on Thursday evening. The clashes came amid a rise in anti-Semitism globally since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. 'The mayor has rightly decided that there will be a ban on demonstrating in the city this weekend,' the court announced on X. It therefore 'rejected the request' by protests to hold their demonstration. Dutch activist Frank van der Linde applied for an urgent permit to demonstrate on the city's famous Dam Square, despite a temporary ban on protests announced by mayor Femke Halsema on Friday. Van der Linde wanted to protest on the Dam against the 'genocide in Gaza, but also because our right to protest has been taken away,' Dutch national news agency ANP quoted him as saying. Friday's emergency measures also included heightened police protection and wearing of face masks, and will be in place until Monday morning. But on Sunday afternoon dozens of demonstrators started gathering at the square in the city's center, despite a heavy police presence. The protesters, who were peaceful, chanted slogans and carried placards including one that read: 'We can fight anti-Semitism and genocidal Zionism at the same time.' Tensions building Police said tensions already built ahead of a match between Ajax and Tel Aviv Maccabi at the Johann Cruyff Arena on Thursday. Maccabi fans burned a Palestinian flag on the Dam central square, and vandalized a taxi, Amsterdam police chief Peter Holla said. The Europa League game Thursday finished largely in a peaceful atmosphere, praised by the Ajax club. But sporadic incidents beforehand were linked to both Maccabi supporters, who were allegedly chanting anti-Palestinian slogans, and opposing groups of youths. After the match, groups of men on scooters engaged in 'hit-and-run' attacks on Maccabi fans in areas of the city. Police said the attackers were apparently mobilized by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Halsema described groups targeting fans of the Israeli club, beating and kicking them. 'This is an outburst of anti-Semitism that I hope to never see again,' Halsema said, adding that she was 'ashamed' by the violence. At least 63 people have been arrested so far, but only before and during the match. Four people remained in custody, prosecutors said. Police have launched a massive investigation and more arrests were expected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-arrested-after-defying-amsterdam-protest-ban/7858781.html	2024-11-10T07:09:10-08:00	
Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of severe storm Toraji	Manila — The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as severe tropical storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month. Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centers or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing, according to government figures given to AFP. The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said. 'The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high,' Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday. 'We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important.' Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometers (68 miles) per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said. The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated. Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said. Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms. On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings. Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report Sunday. Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-to-evacuate-2-500-villages-ahead-of-severe-storm-toraji/7858725.html	2024-11-10T05:35:22-08:00	
King Charles III and Kate attend remembrance event as both slowly return to duty	London — King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer. Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation’s war dead. The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I 'on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month' in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead. After the two-minute silence, buglers from the Royal Marines played the Last Post and Charles led the wreath-laying part of the service. The 75-year-old king, dressed in his Royal Navy uniform of the Admiral of the Fleet, laid a wreath of poppies at the base of the Cenotaph in recognition of the fallen from conflicts dating back to World War I. His eldest son and the heir to the throne, William, left his own floral tribute — featuring the Prince of Wales’ feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red. Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, was not present as she recovered from a chest infection. It is the first time since the start of the year that Kate is carrying out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall. Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present. Charles’ ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties. 'They are showing respect to us, as we’ve shown to them by serving,' said Victor Needham-Crofton, 91, an army veteran who served during the Suez Crisis of 1956 and later in Kenya. Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy. The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties. Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family. 'I’m so proud of my wife, I’m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,' William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. 'But from a personal family point of view, it’s been, yeah, it’s been brutal.' While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday. Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England. He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group’s efforts. 'I like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,’’ he told The Associated Press. 'It’s a brotherhood really. Even if you don’t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.’’	https://www.voanews.com/a/princess-kate-makes-rare-consecutive-public-appearances-after-cancer-diagnosis-/7858709.html	2024-11-10T05:02:35-08:00	
IAEA chief to visit Iran on Wednesday	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi will visit Iran next Wednesday and start consultations with Iranian officials the following day, state media reported on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday he might head to Iran in the coming days to discuss its disputed nuclear program and that he expected to work cooperatively with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Long-standing issues between Iran, the IAEA, and Western powers include Tehran barring uranium-enrichment experts from IAEA inspection teams in the country and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Iran has also stepped up nuclear activity since 2019, after then-President Trump abandoned a 2015 deal Iran reached with world powers under which it curbed enrichment -- seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear weapons capability -- and restored tough U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Tehran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the roughly 90% required for an atom bomb. It has enough higher-enriched uranium to produce about four nuclear bombs, if refined further, according to an IAEA yardstick. Iran has long denied any nuclear bomb ambitions, saying it is enriching uranium for civilian energy uses only.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-to-visit-iran-on-wednesday/7858666.html	2024-11-10T02:27:03-08:00	
Vietnam detains pro-democracy activist: state media	Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnamese authorities arrested a pro-democracy activist, state media said, the latest in a crackdown on political dissidents in the southeast Asian country. Tran Khac Duc, 29, was held on charges of 'creating, storing, distributing or disseminating information, documents and items aimed at opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,' according to the publication Safeguarding the Law. He was arrested in September, but authorities only announced his detention through state media on Saturday. Duc is affiliated with the Assembly for Democracy and Pluralism organization, whose website says it aims to 'establish a multi-party democratic system' in the communist nation. Its website praised Duc as an 'intelligent, wise, dynamic and gentle young man' who 'firmly believes that Vietnam should progress towards a pluralistic democracy,' maintaining that he is an 'informal member' of the group. It reposted state media's announcement of Duc's arrest but did not directly comment on it. The ADP was founded in 1982 and is led by Nguyen Gia Kieng, an intellectual and former official of the U.S.-allied South Vietnamese government before the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Kieng -- who lives in exile in France -- told Radio Free Asia Saturday that ADP members had previously been harassed and beaten by police, but that Duc's arrest was 'unusual.' It comes less than two weeks after a Vietnamese court sentenced a blogger who criticized the government to 12 years in jail on the same charges. The country ranks 174th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders campaign group's World Press Freedom Index.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-detains-pro-democracy-activist-state-media/7858662.html	2024-11-10T01:52:39-08:00	
Indonesia's new leader calls for collaboration with China before heading to US	BEIJING — Indonesia's new leader called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of $10 billion in new deals at a business forum on Sunday in the Chinese capital before heading to the U.S. President Prabowo Subianto told the forum that his country wants to be part of China's emergence as not only an economic but also a 'civilizational power.' 'We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration — not confrontation — is the way for peace and prosperity,' he said. Subianto wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to Washington — where the U.S. government is confronting China's rise — and then to Peru and Brazil for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits. He and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed Saturday to deepen ties, elevating security to a fifth 'pillar' of cooperation in addition to political, economic, maritime and people-to-people exchange. They agreed to hold a first-ever joint meeting of their foreign and defense ministers in 2025, a joint statement said. 'Indonesia is very clear,' Subianto said. 'We have always been nonaligned, we have always been respectful of all great powers in the world.' Indonesia has remained on the periphery of the territorial disputes between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea. It doesn't have a formal dispute with Beijing though Indonesia said its patrol ships repeatedly drove a Chinese coast guard vessel away from an Indonesian energy company vessel conducting a seismic survey less than a month ago. Chinese companies have invested heavily in mining in Indonesia, as they have elsewhere in the world. China also helped build Indonesia's first high-speed railway, a 142-kilometer route between Jakarta and Bandung that opened last year. But a flood of low-priced Chinese products has hit Indonesia's garment makers hard, shuttering factories and prompting calls for import tariffs. The government has sought to placate domestic producers while not angering the country's biggest trading partner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-new-leader-calls-for-collaboration-with-china-before-heading-to-us/7858656.html	2024-11-10T01:35:22-08:00	
1760 schoolhouse for Black U.S. children holds complicated history of slavery, resilience	WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished restoring the nation's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children, where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a curriculum that justified slavery. The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80 children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3, was the property of local tavern keepers. Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee 'can read.' The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. 'An amazing mirror' Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic moments of the last decade. 'History is an amazing mirror,' Bunch added. 'It's a mirror that challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we've achieved, despite all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an amazing work it is.' The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about race and education, but also resistance, before the American Revolution. The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and encouraged children to accept their fates as God's plan. And yet, becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to share what they learned with family members and others who were enslaved. 'We don't shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school,' said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William & Mary's Bray School Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st century. 'It's a story of resilience and resistance,' Lee said. 'And I put the resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to today.' To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the students, with some success. They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum's African American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the students Elisha and Mary Jones. 'It grounds you,' said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection to history. 'That's where your power is. And those are the things that give you strength — to know what your family has come through.' Franklin's idea The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3 to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into William & Mary's growing campus. The building was moved and expanded for various purposes, including student housing. Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original city. The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse, researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former students. The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby families, two free Black households that had students in the school, said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab's genealogist. But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have survived. They 'weren't considered people' Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century property records, tax documents and enslavers' diaries. 'When you're talking about researching formerly enslaved people, records were kept very differently because they weren't considered people,' Drembus said. Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to syllables, such as 'Beg leg meg peg.' Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian texts. Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the children and teacher placed their feet. Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students, wondered on a recent visit if any of the children 'felt safe in here, whether they felt loved.' Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two kids. 'Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those children?' Canaday said. 'There are moments when we forget to go by the rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in these spaces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/schoolhouse-for-black-u-s-children-holds-complicated-history-of-slavery-resilience-/7857921.html	2024-11-10T01:22:44-08:00	
Temple of Satan gains ground in Chile as faith in traditional religions wanes	SANTIAGO, Chile — It's Friday night in Santiago, and 15 people gather around a table, sharing a bottle of wine as the smell of tobacco and incense fill the air. Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual. Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines — and unleashed a wave of panic — when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where half of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to be recognized legally as a religious association. Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church over the years. 'These types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,' said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that's because, 'until very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.' No sacrifices, devil worship Despite its name, the Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor ask its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, and who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions. While they embrace the term Satanist, they don't revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life. Rather than gods, they praise humankind. 'You are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,' said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He noted that the figure of Satan is purely symbolic and their rituals are performed 'to bring out the emotions and leave the intellect aside.' Haborym and other members of the Temple of Satan in Chile spoke on condition their real names not be used, particularly with many holding public-facing jobs, citing growing threats. While Hollywood movies like 'Rosemary's Baby' and TV series such as 'True Detective' helped to portray the idea of Satanists as linked to sacrifice, evil, pain and death, modern groups like Chile's Temple of Satan are strongly against animal abuse, prohibit the affiliation of people with criminal records, see pleasures as a delight rather than a sin, and do not express their opinions unless asked. 'We don't want people killing in the name of Satan,' said Haborym. How to join In order to join Chile's Temple of Satan, applicants are requested to go through a lengthy process that includes filling out a form, showing proof of not having a criminal record, being interviewed by a special commission and, finally, being evaluated by a psychologist. Once they are accepted, members can choose a new name — normally that of a demon or fallen angel — with which they will be identified inside the temple and among other associates. Founded in 2021, Chile's Temple of Satan has 100 members, and more than 400 people applied to join in the past few weeks, said Haborym. The interest spiked at the end of July, when the group formally requested that the country's Ministry of Justice legally recognize it as a religious association. A media frenzy followed, unleashing a heated debate and causing a stir among Chile's main religious denominations. 'The history of Satanism is well known [and] it has often been the cause of tragedies,' the leaders of several churches in Chile, including the Catholic, Anglican, Jewish and Evangelical, said in a joint statement. Following in the steps of the Church of Satan, founded in 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey, modern Satanists praise skepticism and logic over celestial or supernatural beings. Its followers are free to formulate their own beliefs, rites and spiritual practices. Many self-described Satanists and Luciferians are atheists. Others say they are witches or believe in the power of magic. 'We do accept that there are certain bases, both academic and esoteric, that give meaning to our existence and reality,' said Azazel, who quit Judaism four years ago and, one year later, founded the Temple of Satan of Chile. His words resonate in the darkness of the chamber and are interspersed with chants, clapping, mantras and readings of passages from the Satanic Bible and the Bible of the Adversary, the main guidelines of the group. Disappointed worshippers Just like Azazel, others have turned to the Temple of Satan out of disappointment with traditional religions. The new congregants include not only occultists and esotericists, but also Catholics, Jews, Protestants and Evangelicals. 'In Satanism there are no solutions or absolute truths. You are your own god and you create your own reality,' said Kali Ma, a dentistry student who was born and raised in a Jehovah's Witness family. 'If we compare both, Jehovah's Witnesses are the real sect,' she said. 'They don't let you do certain things, they tell you how to dress, what to do, how to behave, whether or not to grow a beard.' Nestor da Costa, an expert in secularism and religion at the Catholic University of Uruguay, said the influx of people seeking answers through different perspectives might be linked to the search for less dogmatic approaches. 'It may be a readjustment of the religious side of people who leave Catholicism but continue to believe in something,' he said. It is unclear if the Chilean government will legally recognize the Temple of Satan as a legitimate religious association, but its very existence has already helped to spark a discussion that until recently was unthinkable in this conservative society. Demanding recognition is the ultimate expression of everything praised by Satanic aesthetics: the rebellion against the status quo and the breakup with deep-rooted traditions. 'We comply with everything that is requested of us as a religious entity,' says Haborym. 'So there would be no reason to reject us beyond the fact that we're a controversial figure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/temple-of-satan-gains-ground-in-chile-as-faith-in-traditional-religions-wanes-/7857905.html	2024-11-10T01:21:57-08:00	
With the holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets	NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does matter. Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4 meters diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed. Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts. The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores. 'It's really taken off this year,' Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said. Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said. Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his 1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art. 'We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, 'Why not?'' he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. 'You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You're sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.' The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said. Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5 centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292 centimeters are on the market right now, he said. 'You get better resolution over time,' Kowalski said. 'You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it's easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.' Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as 'incredible.' 'If you're watching YouTube TV content or ' NFL Sunday Ticket,' you can actually get four screens up, and that's four 48-inch (122-centimeter) screens on it,' he said. Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene. James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting. 'It's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,' Fishler said. 'They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. ' Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, its Sam's Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens. TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows. 'A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,' Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. 'But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.' Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, 'It's still a niche business.' 'A lot of people just don't have the space to put one of those in,' he added. Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said. But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said. If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go? 'I think we'll have to wait and see,' Fishler said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-the-holidays-approaching-us-stores-stock-more-supersize-tv-sets-/7856294.html	2024-11-10T01:21:22-08:00	
Report finds Church of England covered up 'horrific' abuse at summer camps decades ago	london — The Church of England covered up 'horrific' abuse by a lawyer who volunteered at Christian summer camps in the 1970s and 1980s, and the ceremonial head of the Anglican Communion failed to report him to authorities when he learned of the abuse in 2013, according to an independent review released Thursday. John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at age 75, physically, sexually, psychologically and spiritually abused about 30 boys and young men in the U.K. and 85 in Africa over five decades, the 251-page report commissioned by the church found. Smyth is believed to be the most prolific serial abuser associated with the church. 'Many of the victims who took the brave decision to speak to us about what they experienced have carried this abuse silently for more than 40 years,' said Keith Makin, who led the review. 'Despite the efforts of some individuals to bring the abuse to the attention of authorities, the responses by the Church of England and others were wholly ineffective and amounted to a coverup.' The church said it was 'deeply sorry for the horrific abuse,' adding 'there is never a place for covering up abuse.' Smyth, who was an accomplished lawyer and charismatic speaker, was a volunteer leader at the Iwerne camps. The camps held in several locations were associated with the church and were developed to prepare young men from leading schools for high offices in the church and other parts of society. 14,000 strokes of the cane Smyth used a cane to punish campers for 'sins' that included 'pride,' making sexual remarks, masturbation or, in one case, looking at a girl too long, according to the report. The victims and Smyth were at least partly, if not fully, naked during the savage beatings. 'The scale and severity of the practice was horrific,' the report noted. 'Beatings of 100 strokes for masturbation, 400 for pride, and one of 800 strokes for some undisclosed 'fall' are recorded.' Eight of the victims received about 14,000 strokes of the cane and two reported 8,000 lashes over three years. Eight men said they often bled from the whippings and others reported bruising and scarring. A secret report of the abuse was compiled by a minister in 1982 and other church officers were aware of it, but police were never contacted. 'I thought it would do the work of God immense damage if this were public,' the now-deceased Rev. David Fletcher told people who worked on the new report. Smyth was strongly encouraged to leave and ended up moving to Zimbabwe with this wife and children, the report said. He received financial help from church officers. 'Church officers knew of the abuse and failed to take the steps necessary to prevent further abuse occurring,' the report said. Church officials, including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the ceremonial head of the church, had another opportunity to report Smyth — and prevent any potential further abuse — when they learned of it in 2013, but didn't do so, the report said. Welby, who attended Iwerne camps and had known Smyth, said he was unaware of the abuse before 2013. 'Nevertheless the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated,' Welby said. The report said that if Smyth had been reported to police at that time, it could have uncovered the truth and led to a possible criminal conviction. 'In effect, three and a half years was lost, a time within which John Smyth could have been brought to justice and any abuse he was committing in South Africa discovered and stopped,' the report said. Word of his abuse was not made public until a 2017 investigation by Channel 4, which led Hampshire Police to start an investigation. Police were planning to question Smyth at the time of his death and had been prepared to extradite him.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-finds-church-of-england-covered-up-horrific-abuse-at-summer-camps-decades-ago/7856280.html	2024-11-10T01:20:45-08:00	
A Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it decisively	RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán's family has lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he can remember. He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump because he doesn't trust the Democratic Party's economic policies. 'I think they forgot about the middle class,' said Bazán, who works for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic county in the nation. 'People are suffering right now. Everything's very expensive.' The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area, where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in the Rio Grande Valley. In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median household income of $36,000 that's one of the lowest in the nation, gave Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas' southernmost point, among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents patrolling the border. Trump's victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued that Trump's promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off voters. 'I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to Republican with the political landscape that it is now,' said Luis Meza, a 32-year-old Starr County voter. 'I felt that going Republican was the better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything like that that's going on.' Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris. Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by Democratic policies. A similar scenario played out in the state's three most competitive races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats. Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000 from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an opponent he comfortably beat two years ago. Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris, but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in 2020. Trump's support among those groups appeared to rise slightly compared to 2020. In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time. 'I wanted to see change and that's why I did vote for Trump. I did vote red. I would not call myself a Republican' Borrego, 37, said. He said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in prior elections. Borrego's whole family voted Trump. 'We just (made) this choice, because we didn't have another choice that we felt comfortable with,' he said. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving the Democratic Party because of immigration. 'They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They understand something the liberal elites never will: There's nothing progressive about open borders,' Cruz said. 'There is nothing Latino about letting criminals roam free.' Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them. 'I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to have those conversations with Latino households and families.' Mireles said in Hidalgo County after Election Day. 'We can't wait for a big election to have those conversations. By that point, it's too late.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-texas-border-county-backed-democrats-for-generations-trump-won-it-decisively/7856263.html	2024-11-10T01:20:08-08:00	
Florida's iconic Key deer face an uncertain future as seas rise	BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world's only Key deer, the smallest subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads. But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes their sole habitat. These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and poaching long ago. Yet they've made a tremendous comeback, with a peak population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll. However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20 smaller islands the deer call home. The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48 kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500 people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle. Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and weighing around 34 kilograms. 'They were always vulnerable,' said Chris Bergh, the South Florida program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise projects and lives in Big Pine Key. 'They're much more vulnerable now. And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they're becoming even more so.' Highway deer deaths On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving, vacation rentals. To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists they're entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key West. Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. 'The bottom line is that some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year,' said Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer. Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don't feed Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for handouts. Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But a larger threat looms. Climate change impacts on deer The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by 2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level. Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer need to survive, experts say. 'So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places for bearing their young,' said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. 'It puts them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those higher grounds.' In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and freshwater supplies. Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer habitat even more. Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their yards. 'They are very gentle, very, very gentle,' said Connie Ritchie, who sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. 'And the longer you live here, the more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they're so innocent.' 'They have certain plants that they really love,' Ritchie said, noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives away native plants. 'So they're trying to teach us to plant the plants that the deer won't eat.' Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s 'when entire swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide lot-buyers with direct water access,' said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key Deer. While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat. 'We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really concentrated area,' said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key. 'So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have protected, the less areas that they have that are safe.' The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild spaces and the neighborhoods. 'They roam, they spend their day grazing,' Hosokawa said. 'We don't have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they're very good at it. If it's soft and tender, they will try to eat it.' Future of the deer The future, while uncertain, looks grim. Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of 16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor emeritus with Texas A&M University who has studied Key deer since 1968 and has lived here for several years. By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805 hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and 'the deer will already be gone,' Silvy said. What happens if the deer can't survive in the Keys? Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here. 'And at some point, if that's no longer possible, I personally think zoos are the most responsible alternative,' he said. 'But that's a terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?' In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But Silvy said, 'The problem is if you take them any other place with deer, they're going to interbreed and then you've lost the Key deer.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-s-iconic-key-deer-face-an-uncertain-future-as-seas-rise/7856241.html	2024-11-10T01:19:29-08:00	
Mexico City's floating gardens in peril	MEXICO CITY — Cassandra Garduño squinted in the sunlight, her pink boots smudged by dirt as she gazed out over her family's chinampa — one of the islands first built up by the Aztecs with fertile mud from the bottom of a lake that, later drained, would one day become Mexico City. Food from these islands has fed people for hundreds of years, but the chinampas are under threat from urbanization. The produce grown here doesn't fetch much money, and many families are abandoning the ancient practice to rent out or sell their land for more lucrative uses such as soccer fields. 'People don't want to farm anymore,' said Garduño. 'They don't see it as a necessity, they don't want to produce, and people don't want to buy the products.' Some of those remaining, like Garduño, are banding together to preserve and promote the traditional use of the chinampas. 'None of this can exist without human hands, the hands of those who worked here and created the chinampa a thousand years ago,' she said on a recent morning as the smell of celery growing nearby filled the air. The gardens crisscrossed by canals in the capital's southern Xochimilco borough are built up from layers of dredged soil, held together by tall, thin ahuejotes — a kind of willow tree — planted around their perimeter. Xochimilco has more than 2,500 acres of protected land owned by generations of local chinamperos, as those who farm the islands are known. Garduño's earliest memories of her family's chinampa came from peering through her grandparents' window at the plot of land and watching canoes weave in and out of the canals. Even then, she saw how the chinampas were deteriorating under pressure from urbanization and as some farmers began to drop the practice. When her grandfather died in 2010 and her uncles didn't want to carry on, Garduño took it upon herself to learn and conserve generations of farming. Her neighbors and relatives were skeptical at first, but she bought land for her own chinampa from a friend's uncle in 2020 and now grows an assortment of produce, including sunflowers, eggplant, and the Mexican marigold 'cempasuchil.' Now the 32-year-old Garduño is one of the growing collective called Chinampa Refuge, started by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and she and other famers encourage chinamperos to preserve their land. They follow ancient growing techniques but are trying new commercial approaches to compete with cheaper produce grown on massive farms elsewhere in Mexico. That includes a special tag — Etiqueta Chinampera — that tells buyers the produce came from a chinampa, and may tout things like water quality or the chinampa's status as a biodiversity refuge. 'Change comes with educating the new generations,' said Garduño. 'Talking about the origins and efforts to conserve and why it's important to do it.' Luis Zambrano, an ecologist from the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has worked in Xochimilco for decades, said the fields are largely self-sustaining. Nourished by the lake, they can produce three to five crops of vegetables a year without the need of chemicals or irrigation, he said. Moreover, the ecosystem of Xochimilco benefits the sprawling city. Many different species of birds and fish thrive there, and the extensive canals help reduce the city's overall temperature, he said. But now, on weekends, it's common to see more soccer players boating to islands in their jerseys and cleats than farmers tending their crops. The soccer fields stretch for miles along the canals after what Zambrano called 'a massive increase' over the past two to three years. In Xochimilco, many people are reluctant to talk about transforming their chinampas to soccer fields. One landowner who declined to be identified for fear of legal or community backlash said keeping the chinampas productive required more work and financial investment and yielded less revenue. Instead, she has established multiple businesses on her land — a soccer field for weekend games, a food stand and kayaking tours for foreign visitors. 'If you do well (farming) you could earn $5,000 to $10,000 (100,000 to 200,000 pesos) a year,' Garduño said. 'In the tourist area you could have that within a couple of weekends.' But converting the agricultural fields carries ecological impact. While traditional farming methods avoid insecticides and fertilizers, the soccer fields are another story. 'It doesn't look that detrimental because there's no construction,' said Zambrano. But 'it's just as damaging because the amount of chemicals that are used, the amount of pollution that is generated is very, very large.' The chinampas are among the significant features that led Mexico City's historic center and Xochimilco to be recognized as a world heritage site by UNESCO. But any protective measures are up to federal, state and local authorities. Carlos Vasquez, director of the Natural Protected Areas under Mexico City's Environmental Department, said they are working on proposals to address the soccer fields. 'Many are counter to the conservation of the ecosystems,' he said. 'We're looking to regulate these activities.' After a long day's work out in the sun, Garduño and some neighboring farmers congregate under Garduño's makeshift hut for a feast of chicken and tortillas. They catch up on their tasks and outline what's left to do. Juan Ávalos, 63, and his brother Salvador Gonzalez Ávalos, 55, have been working on chinampas all their lives. Their family has several plots in Xochimilco's San Gregorio neighborhood. A year ago, after some convincing by Garduño, the brothers joined Chinampa Refuge to adopt a more holistic approach to their farming. Salvador said the approach is a continuous reminder of his family's legacy in maintaining the ancient practices — something they want to pass on to their grandchildren. 'That's something we need to work on as grandparents,' he said. 'That they integrate themselves with a taste for this earth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-city-s-floating-gardens-in-peril-/7853221.html	2024-11-10T01:18:53-08:00	
Ukraine attacks Moscow with 32 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital	MOSCOW — Ukraine attacked Moscow on Sunday with at least 32 drones, the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the start of the war in 2022, forcing flights to be diverted from three of the city's major airports and injuring at least one person. Russian air defenses shot down 32 drones flying toward Moscow over the Ramenskoye and Kolomensky districts of the Moscow region, as well as in Domodedovo city, home to one of the city's biggest airports, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. '32 drones flying to Moscow have been destroyed,' Sobyanin said. He reported no major damage, though Russia's federal air transport agency said the airports of Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovo had diverted flights. One person was injured. The airports have since resumed their operations, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said. Moscow and its surrounding region, with a population of at least 21 million people, is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe, alongside Istanbul. The Ramenskoye district, some 45 kilometers southeast of the Kremlin, was last targeted in September in what was then Ukraine's biggest attack on the Russian capital, when Russian air defense units destroyed 20 drones. Unverified video posted on Russian Telegram channels showed drones buzzing across the skyline. Russian officials reported multiple Ukrainian drone attacks in other regions, among them the Kaluga, Bryansk and Orlov regions. The 2-1/2-year-old war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war and Donald Trump was elected 47th president of the United States. Trump, who takes office in January, said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours, but has given few details on how he would seek to do this. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Trump to congratulate him on his presidential election victory, Tesla CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk joined the call, according to media reports. Musk owns SpaceX, which provides Starlink satellite communication services that are vital for Ukraine's defense effort. Moscow 'umbrellas' Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbor with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even the Russian strategic early warning radar stations. While the 1,000-kilometer front has largely resembled grinding World War I trench and artillery warfare for much of the war, one of the biggest innovations of the conflict has been drone warfare. Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems. Moscow has developed a series of electronic 'umbrellas' over Moscow, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defenses which shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin at the heart of the Russian capital. Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production. Soldiers on both sides have reported the visceral fear of drones -- and both sides have used macabre video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigors of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants 'terrorism' and has vowed a response. Moscow, by far Russia's richest city, has boomed during the war, buoyed by the biggest defense spending splurge since the Cold War. There was no sign of panic on Moscow's boulevards. Muscovites walked their dogs while the bells of the onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches rang out across the capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-attacks-moscow-with-32-drones-biggest-strike-on-the-russian-capital/7858653.html	2024-11-10T01:18:13-08:00	
Under monthlong Israeli siege, hunger reaches dire levels in North Gaza	JERUSALEM — With virtually no food allowed into the northernmost part of Gaza for the past month, tens of thousands of Palestinians under Israeli siege are rationing their last lentils and flour to survive. As bombardment pounds around them, some say they risk their lives to search for cans of food in the rubble of destroyed homes. Thousands have staggered out of the area, hungry and thin, into Gaza City, where they find the situation little better. 'We are being starved to force us to leave our homes,' said Mohammed Arqouq, whose family of eight is determined to stay in the north, weathering Israel's siege. 'We will die here in our homes.' Medical workers warn that hunger is spiraling to dire proportions under a monthlong siege on north Gaza by the Israeli military, which has been waging a fierce campaign since the beginning of October, saying it's rooting out militants. Hamas militants, who are still holding hostages inside Gaza, have regrouped in the area and have been carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings. The military has severed the area with checkpoints, ordering residents to leave. Many Palestinians fear Israel aims to depopulate the north long-term. On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches next week for a 30-day ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel: raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. Israel has fallen far short. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to figures from Israel's military agency overseeing aid entry, known as COGAT. In the first week of November, the average was 81 a day. The U.N. puts the number even lower — 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October. It says Israeli military operations and general lawlessness often prevent it from collecting supplies, leaving hundreds of truckloads stranded at the border. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Israel had made some progress by announcing the opening of a new crossing into central Gaza and approving new delivery routes. But he said Israel must do more. 'It's not just sufficient to open new roads if more humanitarian assistance isn't going through those roads,' he said. A trickle of food has reached Gaza City, but as of Thursday, nothing entered the towns farther north for 30 days, even as an estimated 70,000 people remain there, said Louise Wateridge, spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, speaking from Gaza City. The Israeli government acknowledged in late October that it hadn't allowed aid into Jabaliya because of military 'operational constraints' in response to a petition by Israeli human rights groups. On Saturday, COGAT said it allowed 11 trucks of food and supplies into Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya. But Alia Zaki, a spokesperson for the U.N.’s World Food Program, said Israeli troops at a checkpoint forced the convoy to unload the food before it could reach shelters in Beit Hanoun. It was not clear what then happened to the supplies. Palestinians in the north described to The Associated Press a desperate daily struggle to find food, water and safety, as strikes level buildings, sometimes killing entire families. Arqouq said he goes out at night to search bombed-out buildings: 'Sometimes you find a half-empty package of flour, canned food and lentils.' His family relies on help from others sheltering at a Jabaliya school, he said, but their food, too, is running low. 'We are like dogs and cats searching for their food in the rubble,' said Um Saber, a widow. She said she and her six children had to flee a school-turned-shelter in Beit Lahiya when Israel struck it. Now they live in her father-in-law's home, stretching meager supplies of lentils and pasta with 40 others, mostly women and children. Ahmed Abu Awda, a 28-year-old father of three living with 25 relatives in a Jabaliya house, said they have a daily meal of lentils with bread, rationing to ensure children eat. 'Sometimes we don't eat at all,' he said. Dr. Rana Soboh, a nutrition specialist at Gaza City's Patient Friend Benevolent Hospital, said she sees about 350 cases of moderate to severe acute malnutrition daily, most from the north but also Gaza City. 'The bone of their chest is showing, the eyes are protruding,' she said, and many have trouble concentrating. 'You repeat something a number of times, so they can understand what we are saying.' She cited a 32-year-old woman shedding weight in her third month of pregnancy — when they put her on the scale, she weighed only 40 kilograms. 'We are suffering, facing the ghost of famine that is hovering over Gaza,' Soboh said. Even before the siege in the north, the Patient Friend hospital saw a flood of children suffering from malnutrition — more than 4,780 in September compared with 1,100 in July, said Dr Ahmad Eskiek, who oversees hospital operations. Soboh said staff get calls from Beit Lahiya and Jabaliya pleading for help: 'What can we do? We have nothing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/under-monthlong-israeli-siege-hunger-reaches-dire-levels-in-north-gaza/7858652.html	2024-11-10T01:02:50-08:00	
Soldier with Yemen's exiled government opens fire, killing 2 Saudi troops	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A soldier for Yemen's exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom's nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday. The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen's Houthi rebels largely has held despite the militants' ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being 'the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.' Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone over the country. The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 500 kilometers east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement. 'The Joint Forces Command underscores that this 'Lone Wolf' cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,' the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added. Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun. Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier's arrest. That's worth around $15,000 on the black market. Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group's Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to 'coordinate operations directly with each other.' The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from 'the feeling of oppression' over Saudi troops being stationed in the area. 'The heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,' Rizq wrote. Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen's exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes. The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes 'on numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.' It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor but offered no other immediate details. The U.S. military has targeted radar stations, military bases and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldier-with-yemen-s-exiled-government-opens-fire-killing-2-saudi-troops/7858648.html	2024-11-09T23:57:07-08:00	
Cricket star Botham saved from crocodile-infested waters after fishing mishap	SYDNEY — England cricketing great Ian Botham was saved by his former Ashes rival Merv Hughes after a fall into crocodile-infested waters while on a fishing trip in northern Australia. Botham, along with Hughes and a group of friends, was on a boat when the accident happened, resulting in some heavy bruising to his torso but no serious injuries for the former England all-rounder. The 68-year-old Botham reportedly got tangled in some ropes while moving to another boat, causing him to slip headfirst into the Moyle River, 200 kilometers southwest of Darwin in Australia's tropical north. The river is known to be inhabited by saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks. Posting about the incident on social media, Botham shared his relief, saying: 'My catch of the day was the barra while I was nearly catch of the day for all the crocs and bull sharks...thanks boys for getting me out.' The two cricket legends, who faced off many times during Ashes series in the late 1980s and early '90s, have maintained a close friendship over the years. In a comment to News Corp, Botham compared himself to the Australian film character Crocodile Dundee, saying: 'At the end of the day, Crocodile Beefy survived. 'I was out of the water quicker than I went in it. Quite a few sets of eyes were having a peep at me. Luckily I had no time to think about what was in the water. The guys were brilliant, it was just one of those accidents. It was all very quick and I'm OK now.' There have been three fatal crocodile attacks in Australia this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cricket-star-botham-saved-from-crocodile-infested-waters-after-fishing-mishap-/7858647.html	2024-11-09T23:46:35-08:00	
Why AP called Arizona for Trump	WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris. At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted. Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270. In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump, but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47. The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can't close the gap and overtake the vote leader. Here's a look at how the AP called this race: Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green). Winner: Trump. Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET. About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day. Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border. Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018. Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years. Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%. Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz. Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden's showing from 2020. She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections. Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then. The AP's analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-ap-called-arizona-for-trump/7858627.html	2024-11-09T21:09:52-08:00	
Trump completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona	Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week's U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday, completing the Republican's sweep of all seven swing states. After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11 electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris. Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in office. The scale and strength of Trump's comeback, which also saw the real estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party. The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to support from white working-class voters and a large share of Hispanics. CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with 218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber. The networks' figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that would significantly curtail Trump's powers. NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the Democrats. The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia. The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday. Trump -- who never conceded his 2020 loss -- sealed a remarkable comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline right-wing stance. This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden's inauguration, but the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the upcoming ceremony. Biden's meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power. Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist. Exit polls showed that voters' top concerns remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win. Trump 2.0 Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris' decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly 100 days before the election. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New York Times that 'had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race.' As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to serve as his White House chief of staff. She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the Republican's first appointment to his incoming administration. Jockeying for jobs Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator Marco Rubio who called Trump a 'con artist' and the 'most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency' in 2016. The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement for whom Trump has pledged a 'big role' in health care, told NBC News on Wednesday that 'I'm not going to take away anybody's vaccines.' The world's richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss enthusiastically backed Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-completes-swing-state-sweep-by-taking-arizona/7858618.html	2024-11-09T20:36:35-08:00	
Canada detects its first presumptive human H5 bird flu case	OTTAWA, Ontario — Canada has detected its first presumptive case of H5 bird flu in a person, a teenager in the western province of British Columbia, health officials said Saturday. The teenager likely caught the virus from a bird or animal and was receiving care at a children's hospital, the province said in a statement. The province said it was investigating the source of exposure and identifying the teenager's contacts. The risk to the public remains low, Canada's Health Minister Mark Holland said in posting on X. 'This is a rare event,' British Columbia Health Officer Bonnie Henry said in a statement. 'We are conducting a thorough investigation to fully understand the source of exposure here in B.C.' H5 bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers. There has been no evidence of person-to-person spread so far. But if that were to happen, a pandemic could unfold, scientists have said. Earlier in November, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked for farm workers who have been exposed to animals with bird flu to be tested for the virus even if they do not have symptoms. Bird flu has infected nearly 450 dairy farms in 15 U.S. states since March, and the CDC has identified 46 human cases of bird flu since April. In Canada, British Columbia has identified at least 22 infected poultry farms since October, and numerous wild birds tested positive, according to the province. Canada has had no cases reported in dairy cattle and no evidence of bird flu in samples of milk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-detects-its-first-presumptive-human-h5-bird-flu-case/7858606.html	2024-11-09T18:21:37-08:00	
Trump says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. 'I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,' Trump posted on social media. 'I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our country.' Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent, who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party primaries. Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not run. Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel announcements via social media posts. Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and former Senator Kelly Loeffler.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-his-administration-/7858603.html	2024-11-09T18:12:31-08:00	
Record 13 women will be governors next year in US	The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire's governor means 13 women will serve as a state's chief executive next year, breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections. Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch campaigns for higher offices. 'It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team,' said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race. Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was thought to be in the running for President-elect Donald Trump's vice presidential post. Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city. Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office. 'This is another side of political leadership where women continue to be underrepresented,' Dittmar said. 'Thirteen out of 50 is still underrepresentation.' With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will be the state's third woman to be governor. 'Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona,' Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said of Ayotte. Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and center. In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy. When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats. New Hampshire's was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman's intelligence, appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens. The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female president. 'I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman,' Dittmar said. 'We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other spaces.' Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must work harder to overcome, Dittmar said. Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders, filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs. 'Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never why one voter acts one way or another,' said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state legislatures. 'But we have so much of that built in to how we see a leader.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/record-13-women-will-be-governors-next-year-in-us/7858602.html	2024-11-09T17:57:09-08:00	
Royal Air Force veteran, 100, joining UK Remembrance Day for 1st time	LONDON — Michael Woods has visited his wife, Mary, every day since she moved into a nursing home two years ago. But on Sunday, the 100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will skip the daily get-together so he can fulfill another duty — honoring the men he served with during World War II. For the first time since he left the RAF in 1947, Woods will take part in Britain's national Remembrance Day service, joining thousands of veterans as they march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London to honor those who died during the world wars and all the conflicts that followed. 'It's a great privilege for me to do this,' said Woods, a mechanic who kept Lancaster bombers flying during the war. 'And I suppose I'll never do it again.' The annual ceremony is a solemn event marked every year when the king and envoys from the Commonwealth nations that fought alongside Britain in the two world wars lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. It culminates when up to 10,000 veterans, many with medals gleaming on their chests and regimental berets on their heads, parade past the memorial. Until now, Woods has watched on television from his home in Dunstable, 50 kilometers away. Mary always watched with him. Woods had a lot on his mind before. For many years, he was busy with his family: two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. And, more recently, he was looking after Mary, his wife of 68 years. But there was something else holding him back as well. He didn't feel he deserved the honor, as he was 'just' a mechanic working on the 12-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that powered the Lancaster bombers. He changed his mind after he connected with other ex-service members through Blind Veterans U.K., the charity that has helped him with his macular degeneration and glaucoma. He felt it was time to remember the men who didn't come home after they roared into the sky aboard planes he had certified as airworthy. Each Lancaster carried a crew of seven, most in their early 20s, so the losses — so many at once — were hard to bear. 'It's very, very upsetting when a Lancaster takes off and it doesn't return,' Woods told The Associated Press. 'I couldn't forget it if I wanted to,' he added. 'It's just imprinted on your mind, you know.' The RAF's Bomber Command had the highest attrition rate of any Allied unit during World War II, with 44% of aircrew members killed in action, according to the International Bomber Command Center. Some 55,573 of the 125,000 who served on the aircrews died during the war. Adrian Bell, CEO of Blind Veterans U.K., said he's met many World War II veterans who describe themselves as mere cogs in a massive machine. But that's what it took to defeat fascism. Everyone was needed. So come Sunday, Woods will be marching. With the stubbornness to retain his independence that seems to have come with turning 100, Woods insists he won't use a wheelchair because he has never used one before and isn't going to start now. Besides, his son, Eddie, will be there to act as a guide and his buddies from the charity will be nearby to offer emotional support. He will be an inspiration, Bell said. 'I think the most important thing is the fortitude of a man who is 100 years old, who fought in the Second World War and beyond, who is going to be there physically on Sunday and marching as a tribute to those who lost their lives and as a sort of a sign of hope and a sign ... that there is life after all of these things,' Bell said. 'That's the embodiment of something that I think is really important.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/royal-air-force-veteran-100-joining-uk-remembrance-day-for-1st-time/7858600.html	2024-11-09T17:29:17-08:00	
12 bodies recovered from Cameroon landslides	Yaounde, Cameroon — Workers have recovered 12 bodies following landslides that engulfed a road in the west of Cameroon, a regional official said Saturday, adding there is no hope of finding survivors. State television CRTV reported the comments by the governor of Ouest region, Augustine Awa Fonka. 'In our opinion, there is no longer any possibility of finding survivors,' he told the station. Only 12 bodies had been recovered from the site of the disaster, the last of them on Saturday morning, he said. Dozens more people are still missing, and the search for bodies is still continuing, he added. Two landslides hit the Dschang cliff road Tuesday — the second as emergency workers were using heavy machinery to try to clear the road. Vehicles hit included three coaches with around 20 seats each, five six-seater vehicles, and several motorbikes said Awa Fonka in an earlier statement. Cameroon's roads are notoriously dangerous, with almost 3,000 deaths each year in accidents, or more than 10 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, published in 2023. In early September, a tractor-trailer carrying passengers plunged off a cliff road into a ravine near the town of Dschang, killing eight people and injuring 62 others, including eight children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bodies-recovered-from-cameroon-landslides-/7858599.html	2024-11-09T17:25:51-08:00	
Israelis fear for hostages as Qatar says Gaza mediation on hold	Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli protesters expressed concern for the hostages in Gaza on Saturday, after Qatar said it was pausing as a key mediator for a cease-fire that would help bring the captives home. Thousands of people rallied in Tel Aviv holding signs reading '400,' the number of days since the hostages were taken when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Efforts to broker a truce in the ensuing war between Hamas and Israel have proven fruitless, and on Saturday Qatar put its mediation on hold until the two sides showed 'willingness and seriousness' in talks. Protester Ruti Lior said she was unsure how much sway Qatar had, but was still 'very, very worried' by their decision to pull back from negotiations. 'This is further proof for me that there really is no seriousness, and these deals are being sabotaged,' the 62-year-old psychotherapist told AFP. Saturday's rally featured an installation of masks representing Netanyahu along with signs bearing the word 'Guilty.' Other placards read 'Hostage deal now' and 'Drop your weapon, stop the war.' 'How many more tears must fall and how much more blood must be shed before someone does what needs to be done and brings our children home?' Niva Wenkert, mother of hostage Omer Wenkert, was quoted as saying in a statement released by campaign group Hostage and Missing Families Forum. In the October 7, 2023, attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israelis have been protesting weekly to pressure their government to do more to secure the captives' release. Qatar, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with U.S. blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Gaza. But the talks, also mediated by Cairo and Washington, have repeatedly hit snags since a one-week truce in November 2023 -- the only one so far -- with both sides trading blame for the impasse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israelis-fear-for-hostages-as-qatar-says-gaza-mediation-on-hold/7858597.html	2024-11-09T17:14:41-08:00	
US, Mexico OK new Rio Grande water-sharing agreement	Mexico City — Mexico and the United States said they have reached an agreement they hope will help Mexico to be timelier with its water-sharing payments in the Rio Bravo watershed, also known as the Rio Grande. The agreement announced Saturday provides Mexico with tools and flexibility to deliver water earlier in a five-year cycle under the 1944 U.S.-Mexico water treaty, according to the bilateral International Border and Water Commission. The proposed tools include better coordination on water conservation, re-use, alternative water sources and other measures. The treaty moves in five-year cycles and allows Mexico to run a water debt in the first four years, if it can make it up in the fifth. That has led Mexico to fall behind, hoping a hurricane or other heavy rains will dump water in the border area. That has frustrated Texas farmers, who need a predictable supply of water. When a hurricane or tropical storm hits the region, Mexico can play catch-up but at that point, the water isn't needed, and that doesn't always happen. Mexico has long used that wait-and-hope strategy, but it has led to problems in the past, both at home and in the U.S. Mexico is obliged to deliver 430 million cubic meters of water per year, or about 2.15 billion cubic meters over five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to flood a one-acre field with one foot of water. The United States, in return, gives Mexico even more water from other water sources farther west. But in the current cycle, which began in 2020, Mexico has so far delivered only about 525 million cubic meters overall, or about one-quarter of what it owes for the five-year period, which ends in October 2025. Mexico has to release water from dams on tributaries feeding into the Rio Grande but that angers Mexican farmers, who want it for themselves and call it 'our water.' The treaty gives the United States rights to one-third of the flows from six Mexican tributaries. In 2020, a dispute over water payments to the United States boiled over into violence, with angry farmers pushing back National Guard troops guarding a dam, because Mexico had fallen behind on payments in that cycle and had to deliver water quickly to the United States. Mexico dispatched National Guard officers to protect the La Boquilla dam, but hundreds of farmers pushed them back hundreds of yards in a failed bid to take over the dam's control room. Before that, farmers took over another dam near the border town of Ojinaga. Both dams are near the Texas border, west of the Big Bend area. During the 2020 conflict, Mexican farmers also burned vehicles and blocked railway lines. In the end, the United States allowed Mexico to transfer rights to water held in joint international reservoirs, in a face-saving solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-mexico-ok-new-rio-grande-water-sharing-agreement-/7858580.html	2024-11-09T17:03:56-08:00	
With costs of living on everyone's minds, Mauritius holds election	port louis — Mauritius holds a parliamentary election Sunday with incumbent Prime Minister and his main rivals all promising to tackle a cost-of-living crisis in the Indian Ocean archipelago. The country of about 1.3 million people markets itself as a link between Africa and Asia, deriving most of its revenues from a flourishing offshore financial sector, tourism and textiles. It has forecast 6.5% economic growth this year compared with 7.0% last year but many voters are not feeling the benefits. Jugnauth's Alliance Lepep coalition has promised to raise minimum wages, increase pensions and reduce value added tax on some basic goods. It says it will use payments from the U.K. under an October agreement for Britain to cede the Chagos Islands while retaining the U.S.-U.K. Diego Garcia air base. Mauritius also receives aid from China. 'The alliance led by the prime minister is selling the economic prosperity card, with promises of more money to different segments of the population,' said political analyst Subash Gobine. The opposition is also pledging to increase pensions as well as introduce free transport and internet services and reduce fuel prices. It is dominated by the Alliance du Changement coalition led by Navin Ramgoolam and two other parties running in the Linion Reform alliance whose leaders, Nando Bodha and Roshi Bhadain, plan to alternate as prime minister if they win. 'It is the youths who will make the difference in these elections,' voter David Stafford, 36, said in the capital Port Louis, explaining that people were looking for economic innovation and job opportunities as much as fiscal changes. Just over 1 million people are expected to choose lawmakers for the islands' 62 seats in parliament for the next five years from a list of 68 parties and five political alliances. Last week, Jugnauth's government blocked social media platforms until a day after the election, when results are expected, citing national security concerns after conversations between public figures were leaked. It lifted the ban a day later after opposition parties criticized the move. Voting starts at 0300 GMT on Sunday and closes at 1400 GMT. Whichever party or coalition gets more than half the seats in parliament also wins the prime minister's post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-costs-of-living-on-everyone-s-minds-mauritius-holds-election-/7858576.html	2024-11-09T16:20:22-08:00	
Firefighters in California, New Jersey make progress on wildfires	Firefighters on two U.S. coasts were making progress Saturday on wildfires in California and New Jersey. Southern California firefighters were gaining ground on a wildfire that destroyed more than 130 structures as gusty winds subsided Saturday with favorable weather conditions expected through the weekend. The Mountain Fire in Ventura County was held at about 83 square kilometers and was 17% contained, Fire Operations Section Chief Clint Swensen said. The fire broke out Wednesday and exploded in size thanks in part to the arrival of dry, warm and gusty northeast winds, forcing thousands of residents to flee and threatening 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around the community of Camarillo. Red flag warnings indicating conditions for high fire danger expired in most of the region Thursday. Smoky air hung over the area Saturday thanks to light winds, the very conditions that were aiding firefighters, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. 'It's very favorable for the weekend,' Kittell said. 'Good for firefighting efforts but not great for air quality.' Some forecasts showed winds returning to the area Tuesday but not to the extent seen last week, Kittell said. The region northwest of Los Angeles, California, has seen some of the state's most destructive fires over the years. Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were reporting 'substantial progress' against a wildfire that was threatening dozens of structures, one of a number of forest fires they are fighting in the state. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service said Saturday afternoon that the fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County had been 50% contained. The blaze is burning more than 65 hectares and is threatening 55 structures, although no evacuations have been ordered. Earlier, the blaze prompted closure of the right lane of northbound Interstate 287, officials said. The Forest Fire Service was battling the blaze with fire engines and ground crews and a helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters of water, officials said. Structures were being protected by local fire companies, they said. Officials also reported fighting a new wildfire that has ignited across more than 728 hectares near the New York-New Jersey border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, New York. The Jennings Creek wildfire was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. An earlier wildfire in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships was reported 90% contained. A blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York, was reported 40% contained and threatened no structures. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning, saying gusty winds and low humidity could help spread fires quickly. New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month, the weather service said, setting a record.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-in-california-new-jersey-make-progress-on-wildfires-/7858380.html	2024-11-09T15:53:57-08:00	
2 Saudi military personnel killed in Yemen attack: state media	Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Two Saudi military personnel have been killed in an attack in Yemen, Saudi state media said Saturday, reporting that the assailant was affiliated with Yemen's defense ministry. 'An officer and a non-commissioned officer were martyred, and an officer was injured as a result of a treacherous and cowardly attack' Friday inside a military camp in the city of Seiyun, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said, citing defense ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Turki al-Maliki. Saudi Arabia mobilized an international coalition to intervene in Yemen to support the internationally recognized government in 2015, after Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital Sanaa the previous year. Seiyun is in the governorate of Hadhramout, which falls under the control of the internationally recognized government. The coalition forces stationed in the camp where the attack took place were helping train local forces to combat terrorism and smuggling, SPA said. The attack took place during athletics training, it said, without elaborating on how it was carried out or providing details of the assailant's identity or position. A Yemeni officer told AFP that the incident began with a verbal altercation between the Yemeni perpetrator and the Saudis, which led to an exchange of gunfire. SPA said that the perpetrator 'does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense who appreciate the positive and important role played by the coalition forces' to back the government. The bodies of the dead and the wounded officer have been transported to Saudi Arabia, SPA said. 'The joint forces will work in coordination with the Yemeni Ministry of Defense to follow up on the investigation procedures to find out the reasons and motives and arrest the perpetrator and bring him to justice,' the report said. The war in Yemen has killed hundreds of thousands either in fighting or from indirect causes such as a lack of food, the United Nations says. Hostilities fell off considerably in April 2022, when a six-month, U.N.-brokered truce came into effect, and they have remained at a low level since.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-military-personnel-killed-in-yemen-attack-state-media-/7858378.html	2024-11-09T15:28:24-08:00	
Israeli raids on Syria kill 4 militants, war monitor says	Beirut, Lebanon — Four pro-Iran fighters were among five people killed in overnight Israeli strikes in north and northwest Syria, a war monitor said on Saturday. 'Four Syrian pro-Iran fighters were killed in Israeli air strikes on the scientific research center and warehouses near Safira east of Aleppo,' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said two other raids further west targeting Saraqeb in Idlib province killed a fifth person. Israeli authorities rarely comment on such strikes but have repeatedly said they will not allow archenemy Iran to expand its presence in Syria. The Observatory said the strikes targeted two headquarters of Syrian regime forces frequented by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Late Saturday, the Observatory reported 'two Israeli strikes' targeting a Syrian army radar position in the southern province of Suweida, without immediately giving further details. Since Syria's civil war broke out in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly targeting army positions and fighters including from Hezbollah. The monitor said the Idlib raids took place near the front line of the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel organization active in the area. HTS controls swaths of the Idlib province and parts of neighboring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia. Syria's official SANA news agency also reported the raids, citing a military source. 'The Israeli army launched an air attack from the direction of southeast Aleppo, targeting a number of sites in the Aleppo and Idlib region,' it said. Several soldiers were injured and there were 'material losses,' SANA added. It said the strikes took place at 12:45 a.m. local time, (2245 GMT Friday). Such strikes have intensified since the escalation on September 23 of Israel's war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Targets for attack have included border crossings between Syrian and Lebanon, which Israel said have been used as supply routes to rearm Hezbollah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-raids-on-syria-kill-4-militants-war-monitor-says-/7858370.html	2024-11-09T15:07:06-08:00	
Spaniards demand Valencia leader resign for bungled flood response	VALENCIA, Spain — Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in the eastern city of Valencia on Saturday to demand the resignation of the regional president in charge of the emergency response to last week's floods that left more than 200 dead and others missing. A group of protestors clashed with riot police in front of Valencia's city hall, where the protestors started their march to the seat of the regional government. Police used batons to beat them back. Regional leader Carlos Mazon is under pressure after his administration failed to issue flood alerts to citizens' cellphones until hours after the flooding started on the night of October 29. Many marchers held up homemade signs or chanted 'Mazon Resign!' Others carried signs with messages such as 'You Killed Us!' Upon arrival at the regional government seat, some protesters slung mud on the building and left handprints of the muck on its facade. Earlier Saturday, Mazon told regional broadcaster A Punt that 'there will be time to hold officials accountable,' but that now 'is time to keep cleaning our streets, helping people and rebuilding.' He said that he 'respected' the march. Mazon, of the conservative Popular Party, is also being criticized for what people perceive as the slow and chaotic response to the natural disaster. Thousands of volunteers were the first boots on the ground in many of the hardest hit areas on Valencia's southern outskirts. It took days for officials to mobilize the thousands of police reinforcements and soldiers that the regional government asked central authorities to send in. In Spain, regional governments are charged with handling civil protection and can ask the national government in Madrid, led by the Socialists, for extra resources. Mazon has defended his handling of the crisis, saying that its magnitude was unforeseeable and that his administration didn't receive sufficient warnings from central authorities. But Spain's weather agency issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for bad weather as early as 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning as the disaster loomed. Some communities were flooded by 6 p.m. It took until after 8 p.m. for Mazon's administration to send out alerts to people's cellphones. Mazon was with Spain's royals and Socialist prime minister when they were pelted with mud by enraged residents during their first visit to a devastated area last weekend. Sara Sanchez Gurillo attended the protest because she had lost her brother-in-law, 62-year-old Candido Molina Pulgarin. She said his body was found in a field of orange trees after he was trapped by the water in his home in the town of Cheste, west of Valencia. She wanted Mazon to go, but also had harsh words for the country's leaders. 'It's shameful what has happened,' Sanchez said. 'They knew that the sky was going to fall and yet they didn't warn anyone. They didn't evacuate the people. We want them to resign!' 'The central government should have taken charge. They should have sent in the army earlier. The king should have made them send it in. Why do we want him as a symbolic figure? He is worthless. The people are alone. They have abandoned us.' The death toll stood at 220 victims Saturday, with 212 coming in the eastern Valencia region, as the search for bodies goes on. Thousands more lost their homes and streets are still covered in mud and debris 11 days since the arrival of a tsunami-like wave following a record deluge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spaniards-demand-valencia-leader-resign-for-bungled-flood-response-/7858365.html	2024-11-09T14:45:40-08:00	
Afghanistan to attend UN climate talks, says Kabul	kabul, Afghanistan — An Afghan delegation will attend the upcoming United Nations climate change summit in Azerbaijan, the foreign ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse on Saturday, marking a first since the Taliban government came to power. 'A delegation of the Afghan government will be in Baku' for the COP29 summit, which opens on Monday in the Azerbaijani capital, said the spokesperson, Abdul Qahar Balkhi. It was not immediately clear in what capacity the delegation would participate at COP29, but sources indicated it would have observer status. Afghanistan is ranked as the country sixth most vulnerable to climate change and Taliban authorities have pushed for the government's participation in COP summits, saying their political isolation shouldn't bar them from international climate talks. No state has recognized the Taliban authorities since they swept to power in 2021, ousting the Western-backed administration. Officials from the country's National Environmental Protection Agency have repeatedly said climate change should not be politicized and called for environment-related projects put on hold due to the Taliban takeover to be reinstated. Azerbaijan, a fossil fuel-rich former Soviet republic wedged between Russia and Iran, will host the COP29 from November 11-22. Baku reopened its embassy in Kabul in February this year, though it has not officially recognized the Taliban government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghanistan-to-attend-un-climate-talks-says-kabul/7858352.html	2024-11-09T14:04:34-08:00	
Putin signs into law mutual defense treaty with North Korea	Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a treaty on the country's strategic partnership with North Korea which includes a mutual defense provision, according to a decree published Saturday. The accord, signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June after a summit in Pyongyang, calls on each side to come to the other's aid in case of an armed attack. Russia's upper house ratified the treaty this week, while the lower house endorsed it last month. Putin signed a decree on that ratification that appeared Saturday on a government website outlining legislative procedures. The treaty galvanizes closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Reports from South Korea and Western countries say North Korea has supplied Russia with weaponry. Ukrainian forensic experts say they have found traces of the weapons at sites of Russian attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that North Korea has sent 11,000 troops to Russia and some of them suffered casualties in combat with Kyiv's forces in Russia's southern Kursk region. Russia has not confirmed the presence of the North Korean troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-signs-into-law-mutual-defense-treaty-with-north-korea-/7858346.html	2024-11-09T13:55:43-08:00	
Israeli strikes pound Lebanese towns, killing more than 20 say officials	Beirut — Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon over the last day have killed more than 20 people including several children, Lebanese authorities said on Saturday, after heavy Israeli bombardment pounded the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut overnight. At least seven people were killed in the coastal city of Tyre late on Friday, Lebanon's health ministry said. The Israeli military has previously ordered swathes of the city to evacuate but there were no orders published by the Israeli military spokesperson on social media platform X ahead of Friday's strikes. The ministry said two children were among the dead. Rescue operations were ongoing and other body parts retrieved in the aftermath of the attack would undergo DNA testing to identify them, the ministry added. At least 16 more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday across the eastern plains around the historic city of Baalbek, the area's governor said in a post on social media platform X. Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Lebanese health ministry said Israeli attacks have killed at least 3,136 people and wounded 13,979 in Lebanon over the last year. The toll includes 619 women and 194 children. Israel has been locked in fighting with Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since October 2023, but fighting has escalated dramatically since late September of this year. Israel has intensified and expanded its bombing campaign, and Hezbollah has ramped up daily rocket and drone attacks against Israel. The Iran-backed group announced more than 20 operations on Saturday, as well as one that it said fighters carried out the previous day against a military factory south of Tel Aviv. More than a dozen Israeli strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut overnight, once a bustling collection of neighborhoods and a key stronghold of Hezbollah. Now, many buildings have been almost entirely flattened, with Hezbollah's yellow flags jutting out from the ruins, according to Reuters reporters who were taken on a tour of the area by Hezbollah. Some buildings were partially damaged by the strikes, leading some floors to collapse and sending furniture and other personal belongings spilling onto parked cars below. Men and women were picking through the rubble for their belongings, shoving blankets and mats under their arms or into black plastic bags. 'We are trying to gather as many [of our possessions] as we can, so we can manage to live off them, nothing more,' said Hassan Hannawi, one of the men looking for his belongings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858334.html	2024-11-09T13:37:06-08:00	
Experts release new guidelines for preventing strokes	Most strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that. Stroke was the fourth-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors. The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk. The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems — eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain. Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. 'Our world is stacked against us,' he said. Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines: What is a stroke? A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death. How eating healthy can reduce your risk for stroke Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association. The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood. Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check. Moving your body can help prevent strokes Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can 'drastically' reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke. Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity — or some combination — per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home. New tools to reduce obesity, a risk factor for stroke Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated. The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes. But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital. Guidelines help identify people who might be at higher risk The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC. 'If somebody doesn't have insurance or they can't get to a doctor's office because of transportation issues or they can't get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,' Bushnell said. Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership. The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause. How do I know if I'm having a stroke and what do I do? Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-release-new-guidelines-for-preventing-strokes/7858318.html	2024-11-09T12:55:33-08:00	
Burkina wants to reinstate death penalty: government source	Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Burkina Faso's military regime wants to reinstate the death penalty after the West African country abolished it in 2018, a government source told AFP on Saturday. The latest execution in Burkina Faso was in 1988, according to Amnesty International. Reintroducing capital punishment to the penal code 'is being considered. It's up to the government to discuss it, then make the proposal to the Transitional Legislative Assembly (ALT) for adoption,' the source said, adding that the date had not been chosen. Justice Minister Rodrigue Bayala said Friday — after parliament passed a bill introducing community service — that 'the issue of death penalty, which is being discussed, will be implemented in the draft criminal code.' Bayala also said there could be further amendments to the criminal code, 'to follow the vision and the guidelines given by the head of state, Captain Ibrahim Traore,' who seized power in a September 2022 coup. The Burkinabe government in July passed a bill that included plans to ban homosexuality. Amnesty International has reported a surge in the use of the death penalty on the African continent, saying in a statement in October that 'recorded executions more than tripled and recorded death sentences increased significantly by 66%.' On the other hand, the rights group noted that '24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa have abolished the death penalty for all crimes while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only.' 'Kenya and Zimbabwe currently have bills tabled to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, while Gambia ... has commenced a constitutional amendment process that will ... effectively abolish the death penalty,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858302.html	2024-11-09T12:09:49-08:00	
Ecuador's vice president suspended amid rift with president	QUITO, ECUADOR — Ecuadoran Vice President Veronica Abad was suspended Saturday for 150 days after being accused of 'unjustified abandonment' of her duties. It comes during a public rift between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that could have implications for Ecuador's February elections. Abad's suspension without pay came at midnight, her lawyer Dominique Davila told The Associated Press. Davila called the move 'extremely serious' and claimed it may not have any legal backing. Abad was accused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer her from Israel — where she also serves as ambassador — to Turkey due to the conflict, arriving eight days after the order. Abad had argued that she was not 'properly prepared' for the trip to Turkey and that Ecuador's government suggested 'that I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.' The move comes at a time of deep tensions between Abad and Noboa who, despite running the government together, have clashed for years, establishing a sort of feud, the origins of which are unknown. In August, Abad filed a legal complaint accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence. The suspension was the second sanction against Abad in less than a week. Abad was also fined $8,500 on Tuesday by Ecuador’s Electoral Disputes Tribunal for early election campaigning in 2023, when she was a candidate for mayor of Cuenca. The vice president has previously cited the Israel case and other incidents as government measures to pressure her to resign, while the president has called her 'disloyal.' Davila said the suspension was the latest attempt to push Abad out, calling it a 'trick to prevent the presidential succession' and something they planned to appeal. Abad’s fate has special importance for Noboa, who hopes to run for reelection in February 2025 and will have to request a leave of absence to carry out the campaign, according to experts. In that case, Abad would take over the presidency. But with the recent sanctions, the pathway to her taking the reins would be blocked, according to constitutional lawyer Andre Benavides. The expert said that while the suspension lacks strong legal backing, any appeals process to reverse the 150-day suspension would take longer than the suspension period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-s-vice-president-suspended-amid-rift-with-president/7858286.html	2024-11-09T11:12:29-08:00	
US will appeal ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guilty, avoid death penalty	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Defense Department will appeal a military judge's ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, and two of his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday. The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the military commission. The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Admiral Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision. The ruling by the judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, allowed the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary. The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals. The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given their torture in CIA custody. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-appeal-ruling-that-9-11-defendants-can-plead-guilty-avoid-death-penalty/7858278.html	2024-11-09T10:48:09-08:00	
Suspect arrested in killing of American tourist in Budapest	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY — A 31-year-old American tourist was killed while on vacation in Hungary’s capital, and the suspect, a 37-year-old Irish man, has been arrested, Hungarian police said Saturday. The victim, Mackenzie Michalski of Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on November 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed security footage from local nightclubs, on which they observed Michalski with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the night of her disappearance. Police detained the man, an Irish citizen, on the evening of November 7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub and danced before leaving for the man's rented apartment. The man killed Michalski while they were engaged in an 'intimate encounter,' police said. The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., later confessed to the killing but said it was an accident, police said, adding that he attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment and hiding Michalski's body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase and placing her body inside. He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a wooden area outside the town of Szigliget. Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat dead bodies and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area. He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of Budapest police. Michalski’s parents are currently in Budapest, police told The Associated Press. According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called 'Find Mackenzie Michalski,' which was created on November 7, Michalski, who went by 'Kenzie,' was a nurse practitioner who 'will forever be remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/suspect-arrested-in-killing-of-american-tourist-in-budapest/7858275.html	2024-11-09T10:39:35-08:00	
Lithuanian defense minister proposes ways for smoother relations between Europe, Trump	PRAGUE — European nations should not repeat the mistake of creating a barrier between them and President-elect Donald Trump but instead cooperate on issues of common interest, Lithuania’s defense minister said Saturday. Assuming that Trump will again apply what Laurynas Kasciunas called 'his contract approach to our relations,' Kasciunas outlined areas where Europe and the new president could join forces: more investment in defense, European acquisition of American weapons and cooperation on containing China and Iran. 'What we did a little bit wrong last time when he was elected [by defeating] Hillary Clinton, and it was unexpected, we built against him a moral wall,' Kasciunas told The Associated Press. 'I think it was not a correct way,' Kasciunas said. He was speaking on the sidelines of a three-day gathering in Prague focusing on European and transatlantic military capabilities. During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump pushed NATO’s European members to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military. That’s what the allies have been doing. A total of 23 members are expected to meet the 2% target this year, compared with three 10 years ago, according to NATO. Lithuania has already surpassed 2.5% with a goal of reaching 4%, which would be more than the United States. Europe’s defense industry managed to increase output of some products after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but European countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine and 'remain dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military capability,' a report published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies at the Prague event said. Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and Belarus to the east, remains the largest buyer of U.S. arms among the three Baltic states. The minister, whose country was in a spat with China over Taiwan, also spoke in favor of European Union sanctions on Iran. However, Russia's war against Ukraine has been divisive. Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kasciunas insisted that Europe’s military aid to Ukraine must continue and that Russia should not dictate the conditions for peace, while a limited cease-fire would not make sense because it would only help Russian troops recover from losses and strike again. 'We need a just peace, credible peace,' he said. During his election campaign, Trump also threatened actions that could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe, from a trade war with the EU to a withdrawal of NATO commitments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuanian-defense-minister-proposes-ways-for-smoother-relations-between-europe-trump/7858268.html	2024-11-09T10:29:44-08:00	
Tourists in Rome have walkway to Trevi Fountain but can't toss coins into it	ROME — Tourists in Rome won’t be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the Trevi Fountain, following tradition, although an elevated walkway now gives limited access to the monument during maintenance work. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri inaugurated the steel walkway Saturday, saying it will provide tourists with a close-up view of the fountain and calling it a 'unique experience' that won’t be ruined by overcrowding. The walkway over the fountain’s basin will be able to accommodate about 130 people at a time. But tourists won’t be allowed to toss coins from there, as the fountain is currently drained, and could face a 50-euro fine if they do, the mayor warned. City lore has it that tossing a coin into the Baroque fountain will ensure a return trip to Rome. Gualtieri said a small pool has been set up next to the walkway to collect the coins, which are donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals for people in need. The walkway will remain until the end of the maintenance work, which is expected to be finished by year's end. Rome city officials are devising a plan to block off the area around the fountain. Under the plan, visitors will be required to book online and pay 2 euros ($2.20). Once inside, they will have 30 minutes to enjoy the fountain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tourists-in-rome-have-walkway-to-trevi-fountain-but-can-t-toss-coins-into-it/7858262.html	2024-11-09T10:13:39-08:00

Swiss villagers ready to evacuate after Alpine rockslide alert — again	GENEVA — Authorities in eastern Switzerland on Saturday ordered residents of a tiny village to prepare to evacuate as an Alpine rockslide looming overhead threatened to break loose and spill down on their homes. It was the second time that residents of Brienz received evacuation orders, after a similar threat last summer. Local officials said in a statement to villagers that 'high above Brienz, the top part of the uppermost part of the rubble pile has accelerated considerably. It cannot be ruled out that up to 1.2 million cubic meters of rock debris will be moving down the valley in a stream of debris.' Measurements taken by the municipality’s early warning service showed that the top of the rubble pile has been moving at a rate of more than 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) per day at times since the second half of September, the SRF public broadcaster reported. They said that if the rockslide starts accelerating, it could soon reach the village. The centuries-old village straddles German- and Romansch-speaking parts of the eastern Graubuenden region, sitting southwest of Davos at an altitude of about 1,150 meters (about 3,800 feet). Today it has less than 100 residents. The mountain and the rocks on it have been moving since the last Ice Age, local officials say. Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimeters each year, but the movement sped up over the last 20 years. The landslide has been moving about a meter (about 3 feet) per year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-villagers-ready-to-evacuate-after-alpine-rockslide-alert-again/7858238.html	2024-11-09T09:37:39-08:00	
Biden, Trump will meet in Oval Office Wednesday, White House says	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday after Biden pledged an orderly transfer of power following the Republican's decisive election victory. Biden and Trump will meet at the Oval Office at 11:00 a.m., the White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president's return to power in January. Trump sealed a historic comeback to the White House in the November 5 election, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S. politics overshadowed by his often divisive politics. The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal conviction and two impeachments while in office. Exit polls showed that voters' top concern remained the economy and inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic. Biden, who dropped out of the race in July over concerns about his ability to continue at the age of 81, called Trump to congratulate him after his election win.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-will-meet-in-oval-office-wednesday-white-house-says/7858229.html	2024-11-09T09:30:09-08:00

Iranian American activist defiant over Iranian plots to kill her, Trump	BERLIN — In the middle of a Berlin hotel cafe, Masih Alinejad raises her voice and starts singing at the top of her lungs in Farsi, as waiters and her three German government bodyguards turn to watch. 'I blossom through my wounds and my scars,' she translates the lyrics as. 'Because I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman.' Alinejad was expressing her defiance and asserting her right to express herself following the news of Iranian murder-for-hire plots to kill her and Donald Trump that were disclosed by the U.S. Justice Department. She said that some Iranian women had been jailed for singing. The Iranian American human rights activist, who was in Berlin on Saturday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall together with other human rights activists from around the globe, told The Associated Press in an interview that despite the shock of the news, she felt more determination than ever to continue fighting for women's rights in Iran. 'They want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that I’m doing something. I’m hurting them so bad,' said Alinejad, 48, referring to the Iranian government. 'I’m echoing the voice of powerful women and that scares them.' She raised her hand in a defiant fist repeatedly during the interview. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it was charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week’s election with planning the assassination of Trump. Investigators were told of the plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots. Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men — identified as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera by the U.S. Justice Department — were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement. The Justice Department alleges that the two men spent months conducting surveillance on her and, during their efforts to locate and kill her, shared messages about their progress and photographs. Around February, they traveled to Fairfield University in the U.S. state of Connecticut, where Alinejad was scheduled to appear, and took photos of the campus. Around April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing their efforts to locate and kill her, the Justice Department said in a statement Friday. In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that 'you gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out or following her out somewhere and taking care of it,' the statement said. 'It’s scary. But at the same time, I was very pleased that the U.S. law enforcement is protecting me,' Alinejad said, recounting her call with American security officials. 'The same person who was trying to kill President Trump was assigned to kill me as well. I mean, that’s a badge of honor.' In Tehran, Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, rejected the report and called it a plot by Israel-linked circles to make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency reported. Alinejad is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels abroad that critically view Iran, and she has worked as a contractor for U.S.-funded Voice of America’s Farsi-language network since 2015. She fled Iran following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. Alinejad accused the Iranian government of continuing to oppress women in Iran and make them wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, even two years after the death of Mahsa Amini that sparked weekslong mass protests. The fact that the Iranian government has repeatedly tried to kill her, she said, 'makes me more determined to give voice to powerful women inside Iran who are facing the same killers every single day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-american-activist-defiant-over-iranian-plots-to-kill-her-trump/7858221.html	2024-11-09T09:12:37-08:00	
Iran accuses Germany of defending 'terrorist' after death of dual national	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accused Germany of defending a 'terrorist' after the death in Iran of Jamshid Sharmahd, a dual national sentenced to execution, which triggered condemnation from Berlin. Iran on October 28 announced the execution of Sharmahd, 69, but eight days later the judiciary spokesperson said Sharmahd had died before the 'imminent' execution could be carried out, implying natural causes. After the initial execution announcement, Berlin recalled its ambassador to Iran and closed three Iranian consulates in Germany. That in turn triggered what Iran called a 'strong protest' to the German charge d'affaires, who was summoned. 'I regret that this is straining German-Iranian relations, and I wish I could have prevented it,' Araghchi said in an interview published Friday by the German weekly Der Spiegel. 'But to do that, the German government would have had to cooperate and communicate that this is a terrorist, instead of defending someone who has trampled all humanitarian standards underfoot,' he said, according to Spiegel's English edition published online. Earlier this week, Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment about Sharmahd’s passing, said, 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side. 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' Iran, which does not recognize dual citizenship, announced Sharmahd's arrest after a 'complex operation,' without specifying when, where or how he was detained. His family said he was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while traveling through the United Arab Emirates. Iran sentenced Sharmahd to death for his involvement in an April 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz, in the south of the country, which killed 14 people and wounded about 300. Sharmahd was also accused of leading the Tondar group, which aims to topple the Islamic Republic. Iran classes it as a terrorist organization. Jamshid Sharmahd's daughter has told AFP that she and her family 'do not trust anything' Iran says about the circumstances of her father's death. 'If there is a corpse, he needs to be returned and brought back to us as soon as possible,' Gazelle Sharmahd said. Araghchi told Der Spiegel that, 'If his family officially submits a request, we see no obstacles' to returning Jamshid Sharmahd's body. 'The question of whether he was executed or died of natural causes is beside the point,' he said. During the interview, Araghchi also censured what he called the Western 'double standards' that he said failed to condemn Israel for its actions in the Gaza Strip, where its war with Hamas has led to tens of thousands of deaths. 'I am not calling Hamas, Hezbollah and others, 'proxies.' I call them freedom movements. Supporting them brings no benefits to Iran,' which arms and finances Lebanon's Hezbollah and backs Hamas, Araghchi told the German publication.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7858214.html	2024-11-09T09:00:27-08:00	
Qatar to pull out of Gaza cease-fire mediation, source says	DOHA, QATAR — Qatar will stop trying to mediate a Gaza cease-fire deal until Hamas and Israel show a 'sincere willingness' to return to the negotiating table, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters on Saturday, in the biggest setback to efforts to reach a truce since the war began. The Gulf country has also concluded that Hamas' political office in Doha 'no longer serves its purpose,' the official added, in a blow to the Palestinian militant group whose top leaders have been assassinated by Israel. Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, has played a major role in rounds of so-far fruitless talks to broker a cease fire to the yearlong war in Gaza. The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term proposal. 'The Qataris have said since the start of the conflict that they can only mediate when both parties demonstrate a genuine interest in finding a resolution,' the official said, adding that Qatar had notified Hamas, Israel and the U.S. administration of its decision. Washington had told Qatar that Hamas' presence in Doha was no longer acceptable in the weeks since the Palestinian militant group rejected the latest proposal to achieve a cease fire and hostage deal, a U.S. official said on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qatar-to-pull-out-of-gaza-cease-fire-mediation-source-says/7858188.html	2024-11-09T08:24:44-08:00	
Iran urges Trump to change 'maximum pressure' policy	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran signaled an openness toward Donald Trump Saturday, calling on the president-elect to adopt new policies toward it after Washington accused Tehran of involvement in a plot to kill him. Vice President for Strategic Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif urged Trump to reassess the policy of 'maximum pressure' he employed against the Islamic republic during his first term. 'Trump must show that he is not following the wrong policies of the past,' Zarif told reporters. His remarks came after the United States accused Iran of conspiring to assassinate Trump. The Foreign Ministry described the American accusations Saturday as 'totally unfounded.' Tehran and Washington severed diplomatic relations shortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979. 2015 nuclear power accord Zarif, a veteran diplomat who previously served as foreign minister, helped to seal the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and Western powers, including the United States. However, the deal was torpedoed in 2018 after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the deal under Trump, who later reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In response, Iran rolled back its obligations under the deal and has since enriched uranium up to 60%, just 30 percentage points lower than nuclear-grade uranium. Tehran has repeatedly denied Western accusations that it seeks to develop a nuclear weapon. Zarif said Saturday that it was Trump's political approach toward Iran that led to the surge in enrichment levels. 'He must have realized that the maximum pressure policy that he initiated caused Iran's enrichment to reach 60% from 3.5% and increased its centrifuges,' he said. Provocations 'As a man of calculation, he should do the math and see what the advantages and disadvantages of this policy have been and whether he wants to continue or change this harmful policy,' Zarif said. In December 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the following year moved the American embassy there. Trump also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed. During his first term, Trump also ordered the killing of revered Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps foreign operations arm, the Quds Force. Soleimani was killed in a drone strike while he was in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, in January 2020. The Islamic Republic has not recognized its archnemesis Israel since the U.S.-backed shah was toppled in 1979. On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said he hoped the president-elect's return to power would allow Washington to 'revise the wrong approaches of the past,' although he avoided mentioning Trump by name. On Tuesday, election day in the United States, Trump told reporters he was 'not looking to do damage to Iran.' 'My terms are very easy. They can't have a nuclear weapon. I'd like them to be a very successful country,' he said after casting his ballot. Iran insists that it uses nuclear technology for safe and civilian purposes. Trump's election victory came after Iran and Israel attacked each other directly, raising fears of a further regional spillover of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-urges-trump-to-change-maximum-pressure-policy/7858161.html	2024-11-09T08:04:13-08:00	
After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota capitol	MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA — Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first Kenyan-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an elected official. 'I am super excited,' Hiltsley said. 'Today is orientation day for new legislators, and to be standing in this Capitol as an African immigrant woman is a tremendous honor. I’m just overexcited right now.' She said this milestone did not come easily. Her path to the Minnesota State Capitol was marked by struggles, including a fight against an immigration system that nearly led to her family’s deportation. She credits much of her success to the community support and the intervention of the late U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, whose advocacy she said ultimately secured her family’s green cards and, later, citizenship. 'Getting to this moment honestly is just a testament to the struggles that my family has gone through to be in this country,' she said. There has been a media frenzy surrounding Hiltsley’s victory, and it has captured the attention of Kenyan media, with celebrations taking place in her hometown, Nyamboyo village, which is eight hours from Nairobi, Kenya's capital. Despite the attention, Hiltsley said she remains humble. 'I’m that little girl from that little village somewhere in the middle of Kenya, and now I’m in the spotlight of this media frenzy. And so, I’m still trying to really appreciate the magnitude of the moment,' she said. Hiltsley said she has a desire to inspire others, particularly young girls in Kenya and the United States. 'It is still surreal,' she said, adding that 'if I can make it to this point, I can be a role model to somebody to remind them that it is possible that our wildest dreams are possible. And that would be something that I would look back and say, wow, I’ve made a difference in somebody’s life.' Her legislative priorities Looking ahead, Hiltsley said she is committed to championing issues that matter to her constituents in Minnesota’s Legislative District 38A. Her priorities include community-centered public safety policies, affordable housing options, workers’ rights and support for small businesses — many of which are run by African immigrants. 'The resources are out here,' she said, promising to empower her community. 'It is my job to go back to my community and tell them, hey, there are resources here. This is how this system works. Let’s work together to mobilize and make sure that we are also taking a piece of the pie,' she said. As the first Kenyan American woman in Minnesota's Legislature, Hiltsley said she recognizes the weight and responsibility of her position. She described it as 'an honor that I don’t take lightly.' 'I don’t want to be the last,' she, adding that she hopes 'this moment right here is a testimony that you can come to this country, work hard, take care of business, know your craft, stick to it, be consistent and get to where you want to.' Her message to those who have yet to succeed in their political campaigns is clear: Perseverance is key. 'Be consistent. Keep going. There’s enough space in this Legislature for more people of color, especially immigrants, because that’s the voice that is missing,' Hiltsley said. Changing political scene Hiltsley shared her thoughts on the changing political landscape in Washington, particularly with the coming administration under President-elect Donald Trump. While acknowledging the challenges, she said she will stay focused on serving her constituents in Minnesota, regardless of politics. 'We are here to serve the people, and it doesn’t matter if you are Democrat or Republican,' she said. 'We are here as legislators to serve the people of Minnesota.' Hiltsley also shared her heartfelt message to fellow Kenyans who have been celebrating her historic achievement. 'This is a historical moment, and I’m honored to be a Kenyan American,' she said. 'Let’s continue celebrating this victory, but after that, we have work to do.' She said her eyes are set on not just her role in Minnesota, but also finding ways to collaborate with Kenya’s leaders to address issues facing the country, including corruption and a lack of strong leadership. 'Kenya has unlimited potential,' she said. 'It’s up to our leaders to do right by the people.' Hiltsley will officially take her seat in the Minnesota State House of Representatives and be sworn in on January 7. Representatives are elected to serve two-year terms.

Boeing to face civil trial over 2019 MAX crash	NEW YORK — Beleaguered aviation giant Boeing is set to confront another hurdle next week when it faces a civil trial over the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people. The trial, scheduled for federal court in Chicago, originally included six plaintiffs, but 'all but one' have settled, a person close to the litigation told AFP this week. Barring an accord, the case will be Boeing's first civil trial over the MAX crashes. A settlement, which would need court approval, is still possible, even after the proceedings start. But the source told AFP the case is expected to go to trial, a view held by a second legal source. Plaintiffs in the case are relatives of Indian-born Manisha Nukavarapu, who was in her second year of medical school, specializing in endocrinology at East Tennessee State University. Nukavarapu, who was single and without children, boarded a 737 MAX on March 10, 2019, in Addis Ababa in a flight bound for Nairobi to visit her sister, who had just given birth, according to a complaint. But the jet, which had been delivered in November 2018, crashed just six minutes after taking off, killing everyone on board. More trials expected Relatives of 155 victims were deposed by the court between April 2019 and March 2021 in cases of wrongful death due to negligence, according to legal filings. 'As of today, there are 30 cases pending on behalf of 29 decedents,' a third legal source told AFP on October 22. The cases have been split into groups, with the next trial scheduled for April 2025 unless all the suits are settled. Boeing has 'accepted responsibility for the MAX crashes publicly and in civil litigation because the design of the MCAS ... contributed to these events,' an attorney for Boeing said at an October 11 court hearing. The MCAS was a flight stabilizing system that malfunctioned in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and in the October 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia, which killed 189 people. The MAX entered commercial service in May 2017. The worldwide fleet was grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Airlines crash. According to Boeing, more than 90% of the cases stemming from the crashes have been settled. The company has not disclosed the overall financial hit from these cases. 'Boeing has paid billions of dollars to the crash families and their lawyers in connection with civil litigation,' a Boeing attorney said at the October 11 hearing, which took place in Texas and involves a Department of Justice criminal case over the MAX. Dozens of plaintiffs have been deposed in civil litigation over the Lion Air crash, with 46 represented by Seattle law firm Herrmann. The Texas litigation concerns a new deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice after the DOJ concluded Boeing flouted a $2.5 billion January 2021 criminal settlement over fraud charges related to the MAX certification. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to fraud as part of the latest DPA, but the accord has yet to be accepted by a federal judge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-to-face-civil-trial-over-2019-max-crash/7858033.html	2024-11-09T04:35:00-08:00	
Berlin Wall once shaped German women's lives; echoes remain today	BERLIN — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because child care was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach, in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country’s defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989 — and the country’s reunification less than a year later on October 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women’s lives that diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — although some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she said. Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the West; there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States’ reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women’s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmutter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' More than three decades after Germany’s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobblestone path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger. In the former East, 74% of women work, compared with 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Bockler-Stiftung foundation. Child care is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a child care facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany trails some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. About 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared with 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can’t imagine that there are any women who don’t like to be independent,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/berlin-wall-once-shaped-german-women-s-lives-echoes-remain-today/7858022.html	2024-11-09T04:22:45-08:00	
Germany marks 1989 Berlin Wall fall with 'Preserve Freedom' party	BERLIN — Germany marks 35 years since the Berlin Wall fell with festivities beginning Saturday under the theme 'Preserve Freedom!' as Russia's war rages in Ukraine and many fear democracy is under attack. Chancellor Olaf Scholz — whose governing coalition dramatically collapsed this week — said in a message to the nation that the liberal ideals of 1989 'are not something we can take for granted.' 'A look at our history and at the world around us shows this,' said Scholz, whose three-party ruling alliance imploded on the day Donald Trump was elected president in the United States, plunging Germany into political turmoil and toward new elections. November 9, 1989, is celebrated as the day East Germany's dictatorship opened the borders to the West after months of peaceful mass protests, paving the way for German reunification and the collapse of Soviet communism. One Berliner who remembers those momentous events, retiree Jutta Krueger, 75, said about the political crisis hitting just ahead of the anniversary weekend: 'It's a shame that it's coinciding like this now.' 'But we should still really celebrate the fall of the Wall,' she said, hailing it as the moment East Germans could travel and 'freedom had arrived throughout Germany.' President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will kick off events on Saturday at the Berlin Wall Memorial, honoring the at least 140 people killed trying to flee the Moscow-backed German Democratic Republic during the Cold War. In the evening, a 'freedom party' with a music and light show will be held at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate, on the former path of the concrete barrier that had cut the city in two beginning in 1961. On Sunday, the Russian protest punk band Pussy Riot will perform in front of the former headquarters of the Stasi, former East Germany's feared secret police. Pro-democracy activists from around the world have been invited for the commemorations — among them Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and Iranian dissident Masih Alinejad. Talks, performances and a large-scale open-air art exhibition will also mark what Culture Minister Claudia Roth called 'one of the most joyous moments in world history.' Replica placards from the 1989 protests will be on display along 4 kilometers of the wall's route, past the historic Reichstag building and the famous Checkpoint Charlie. Among the art installations will be thousands of images created by citizens on the theme of 'freedom,' to drive home the enduring relevance of the historical event. Populism and division Berlin's top cultural affairs official Joe Chialo said the theme was crucial 'at a time when we are confronted by rising populism, disinformation and social division.' Axel Klausmeier, head of the Berlin Wall foundation, said the values of the 1989 protests 'are the power-bank for the defense of our democracy, which today is being gnawed at from the left and the right.' Most East Germans are grateful the East German regime ended, but many also have unhappy memories of the perceived arrogance of West Germans, and resentment lingers about a remaining gap in incomes and pensions. These sentiments have been cited to explain the strong support for the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in eastern Germany, as well as for the Russia-friendly and anti-capitalist BSW. Strong gains for both at three state elections in the east in September highlighted the enduring political divisions between eastern and western Germany over three decades since reunification. While the troubled government led by Scholz's Social Democrats and the opposition CDU strongly supports Ukraine's defense against Russia, the antiestablishment AfD and BSW oppose it. The AfD, which rails against immigration, was embarrassed this week when several of its members were arrested as suspected members of a racist paramilitary group that had practiced urban warfare drills. On the eve of the anniversary of the Berlin Wall's fall, government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann recalled that the weekend will also mark another, far darker chapter in German history. During the Nazis' Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass pogrom of November 9-10, 1938, at least 90 Jews were murdered, countless properties destroyed, and 1,400 synagogues torched in Germany and Austria. Hoffmann said, 'It is very important for our society to remember the victims ... and learn the correct lessons from those events for our conduct today.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-marks-1989-berlin-wall-fall-with-preserve-freedom-party/7858018.html	2024-11-09T03:53:20-08:00	
Bolivia's Morales barred from running for political office	LA PAZ, BOLIVIA — A constitutional court in Bolivia has barred former President Evo Morales from running again for office, ushering in a new phase in the country's long-running political crisis. Morales, who led Bolivia from 2006 to 2019, had been vying for the candidacy of his MAS party, alongside his former mentee-turned-rival, President Luis Arce. But, in a decision last week that was reported on Friday, Bolivia's constitutional court ruled that presidents were limited to serving two terms, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive. After his first two terms, a court ruling allowed Morales to serve a third term because his first preceded a constitutional rewrite. He ran for a fourth term in the 2019 elections but fled the country after the results were disputed and unrest ensued. Arce was elected in 2020. 'Without a doubt, this ushers in a new era of politics in Bolivia,' opposition lawmaker Marcelo Pedrazas told journalists Friday. 'In 2025, we'll have an election without Evo Morales on the ballot.' Morales' lawyer, Orlando Ceballos, called the court's ruling politically motivated. 'What are they trying to do? To get rid of MAS, to disqualify Evo, that's the point,' Ceballos said in a radio interview, adding that they would take up the matter with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Morales and Arce have increasingly butted heads in past weeks, with Morales supporters using roadblocks to halt commerce and raiding military bases. Morales has called for peaceful talks with the government but went on a nearly weeklong hunger strike in protest of what he considers political persecution by Arce's administration. On Friday, lawmakers loyal to Morales caused chaos in Congress, shouting and throwing flowers at the vice president ahead of Arce's planned yearly address and forcing him to deliver his speech from the presidential palace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-morales-barred-from-running-for-political-office/7858017.html	2024-11-09T03:31:12-08:00	
North Korea jams GPS signals, affecting ships, aircraft in South	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea staged GPS jamming attacks on Friday and Saturday, an operation that was affecting several ships and dozens of civilian aircraft in South Korea, Seoul's military said. The jamming allegations come about a week after the North test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel ICBM missile, its first such launch since being accused of sending soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine. The South fired its own ballistic missile into the sea on Friday in a show of force aimed at demonstrating its resolve to respond to 'any North Korean provocations.' 'North Korea conducted GPS jamming provocations in Haeju and Kaesong yesterday and today,' Seoul's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement Saturday, adding that several vessels and dozens of civilian aircraft were experiencing 'some operational disruptions.' The military warned ships and aircraft operating in the Yellow Sea to beware of such attacks. 'We strongly urge North Korea to immediately cease its GPS provocations and warn that it will be held responsible for any subsequent issues arising from this,' they said in the statement. Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions. It also has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons since May, in what it says is retaliation for anti-Pyongyang propaganda missives sent North by activists. The South Korean military said Pyongyang also attempted to jam GPS signals in May, but added at the time that it did not hinder any military operations in the South. In Friday's drill, South Korea fired a Hyunmoo surface-to-surface short-range missile into the West Sea, which the military said was to show Seoul's 'strong resolve to firmly respond' to any North Korean threats. The Hyunmoo missiles are key to the country's so-called 'Kill Chain' preemptive strike system, which allows Seoul to launch an attack if there are signs of an imminent North Korean attack. 'Real risk' Experts say such jamming attacks can lead to other incidents that could escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula. 'It remains unclear whether there is an intention to divert the world's attention from troop deployments, instill psychological insecurity among residents in the South, or respond to Friday's drills,' said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. 'However, GPS jamming attacks pose a real risk of serious incidents, including potential aircraft accidents in the worst-case scenario,' he told AFP. Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-researcher who runs the World Institute for North Korea Studies, told AFP the North's jamming could be 'to shield their own communications and intelligence exchanges during critical military operations' at home and abroad. Russia and Ukraine North Korea has become one of the most vocal and important backers of Russia's offensive in Ukraine. Seoul and the West have long accused Pyongyang of supplying artillery shells and missiles to Moscow for use in Ukraine. The latest accusations, based on intelligence reports, indicate the North has deployed around 10,000 troops to Russia, suggesting even deeper involvement in the conflict and triggering outcry in Seoul, Kyiv and Western capitals. Seoul, a security ally of Washington, said last month the presence of North Korean troops in Europe would be a major escalation. South Korea, a major arms exporter, has a long-standing policy of not providing weapons to countries in conflict. But President Yoon Suk Yeol said this week that Seoul is now not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons directly to Ukraine, given Pyongyang's military support of Moscow. On Friday, Seoul's presidential office said cyberattacks by pro-Russian hacking groups against South Korea have increased following North Korea's troop dispatch for Russia's war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-jams-gps-signals-affecting-ships-aircraft-in-south/7858015.html	2024-11-09T03:18:52-08:00	
After Amsterdam violence, Israelis worry about sports teams’ safety abroad	The violence against fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam has some Israelis worried that it isn't safe for their sports teams and fans to travel to games abroad. Many Palestinians want them banned entirely over Israel's conduct of the war with Hamas. Dutch authorities say Israeli fans were assaulted after a football game in Amsterdam by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and dozens were arrested after the Thursday night attacks, which were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. Israel's football teams play domestic games at home despite the Israel-Hamas war. But European football body UEFA has ruled that the war with Hamas means Israel cannot host international games. Supporters of the Palestinian campaign to ban Israel from international competition have criticized world football body FIFA for not matching its 2022 decision to suspend Russian national teams from competitions days after the invasion of Ukraine. UEFA also removed Russian teams. Sports and war Israeli teams have been playing their home games in Hungary, Serbia and Cyprus. Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has long promoted Hungary as the safest European country for Jews. He has banned Palestinian solidarity protests, arguing they are a safety threat. Israel's national team has been playing all of its home matches in the men's Nations League this season in Bozsik Arena in Budapest. Maccabi Tel Aviv — the only Israeli men's team to qualify for European club football competitions this season — has been playing its home games in Szombathely, Hungary, and Belgrade, Serbia. A question about away games, too Belgium declined to stage a men's Nations League game against Israel in September. That game was played in Hungary instead, with no fans in the stadium. Other away games have been carried out without incident but the violence in Amsterdam could change things, and not just for soccer. Israel's National Security Council urged Israelis not to attend a match Friday with Maccabi's basketball team in Bologna, Italy, to avoid 'externalizing Israeli/Jewish identification marks as much as possible.' Italian police said security was increased for the game, both for fans and for the Maccabi team. Even before the Amsterdam attacks, UEFA announced that the Maccabi football team's next away match in the Europa League, which was scheduled to take place in Istanbul on November 28 against Besiktas, would be moved to a neutral venue 'following a decision by the Turkish authorities.' The Israeli national team's next away game in men's football is in the Nations League on Thursday, against France at the Stade de France outside Paris. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday that the game would go ahead after police assured him they could keep fans safe. Assaf Nachum, a spokesperson for Israel's Beitar football club, said Israeli football fans will 'need to see a lot of actions of security and police around where we are going to stay' in Paris. 'I imagine it will be harder to convince Israeli fans to come, especially because this happened in Amsterdam,' he said. Threats, jeers and protests when Israelis compete Israeli athletes competed in the Paris Olympics under heavy security. There were no major security incidents, but some Israeli athletes said they received threats. The Israeli team was met by jeers in stadiums during the country's national anthem, and athletes arrived under heavy police escort, including riot police vans. Anti-Israel protests have occurred at sports events around Europe this year, including at Maccabi football’s away games against the teams Steaua Bucharest of Romania and Braga of Portugal. Both teams were fined 10,000 euros ($10,800) each on charges of behavior unfit for sports after fans waved Palestinian flags. In September, a group of about 50 Italy fans in black turned their backs in apparent protest during Israel's national anthem before a Nations League match in Budapest. In May, a women's European Championship qualifier between Scotland and Israel in Glasgow was delayed after a pro-Palestinian protester chained himself to the goalpost. The protester made it onto the field even though the game was being played without spectators over concerns about disruptive protests over Israel's offensive in Gaza. Palestinians want to ban Israel from international football Israel's neighbors in the Middle East play in Asian competitions. Israel did too until the 1970s, when it was expelled from the Asian Football Confederation after several Arab and Muslim nations refused to play against it. Israel was invited to European qualifying for the 1982 World Cup and has been a member of UEFA since 1994. The Palestinian football federation has sent multiple requests to FIFA for Israel to be suspended from international soccer competitions. In its motion, the federation noted 'international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza' and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination. It also said its football infrastructure — including its signature Al-Yarmuk stadium — has been destroyed or damaged. FIFA stopped short of suspending Israel in October but asked for a disciplinary investigation of possible discrimination by Israeli officials. The Palestinian football federation also has consistently asked FIFA for more than a decade to take action against the Israeli football body for incorporating teams from West Bank settlements in its leagues. Could Israel be banned like Russia? Russia is a pariah in European football. Its teams were banned by FIFA ahead of the 2022 World Cup qualifying playoffs because of chaos that could ensue if opponents refused to play Russia. FIFA said the consequences for the World Cup 'would be irreparable and chaotic' had Russia advanced to the tournament in Qatar. No European federation has refused to play the national or clubs teams of Israel, which has been a member of UEFA for 30 years. Israel's men's team will be in the draw for European qualifying groups for the 2026 World Cup, which is made on December 13 in Zurich. The next World Cup is co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Ukraine's national and club teams have not played international games on its own territory since the Russian military invasion in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-amsterdam-violence-israelis-worry-about-sports-teams-safety-abroad/7857917.html	2024-11-09T01:48:36-08:00	
India's ban on Rushdie’s 'Satanic Verses' may end — thanks to missing paperwork	NEW DELHI — The decadeslong ban of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses in his native India is now in doubt — not because of a change of heart more than two years after the author's near-fatal stabbing, but because of what amounts to some missing paperwork. Earlier this week, a court in New Delhi closed proceedings on a petition filed five years ago that challenged the then-government's decision to ban the import of the novel, which enraged Muslims worldwide because of its alleged blasphemy, just days after its 1988 publication. In a ruling issued Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India news agency, a bench headed by Justice Rekha Palli said authorities had failed to produce the notification of the ban. 'We have no other option except to presume that no such notification exists,' the judges concluded. The petitioner, Sandipan Khan, had argued that he couldn't buy the book because of a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs on October 5, 1988, which forbade its import into India, adding that he was unable to locate the notification on any official website or through officials. Khan's lawyer, Uddyam Mukherjee, said that the court's ruling meant that as of now, nothing prohibits anybody from importing the novel into India. 'But whether this means it will be sold in bookstores — I don't know, that depends on the publishers or sellers,' he told The Associated Press. When reached by phone, several bookstores in the country's capital were unaware of the news. An employee of Jain Book Agency in New Delhi said that they did not know whether this news meant that the novel would be available again in stores in India, adding that if that was the case, it could still take time and that they would need to hear from the publisher. 'What the ruling does is open up a potential path for the book to become available here,' Mukherjee said, but added that any aggrieved individual, group or the government can also appeal against it. Rushdie's literary agent, Andrew Wylie, declined comment to the AP. Rushdie, now a citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States, has yet to comment publicly. He has more than 1 million followers on his X account, on which he last posted in September. Rushdie's publisher in India, Penguin Random House India, issued a statement Friday called the ruling a 'significant new development' and adding that it was 'thinking through next steps.' This week's ruling adds a new twist to Rushdie's complex relationship with India, where he was born in 1947, just before the country's independence. He left as a child and was living in the United Kingdom at the time of his breakout novel, Midnight's Children, which came out in 1981 and infuriated India's prime minister at the time, Indira Gandhi, who was satirized in the book. After she sued over a reference to her having caused her husband's death, Rushdie agreed to remove it, and the case was settled. When India banned The Satanic Verses, Rushdie condemned the action and doubted whether his censors had even read the novel. In an open letter to then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, published in The New York Times in 1988, he alleged the book was 'being used as a political football' and called the ban not only 'anti-democratic, but opportunistic.' Over the years, Rushdie has made private trips to India and attended the Jaipur Literary Festival in 2007. But five years later, he canceled plans to attend the Jaipur gathering because of security concerns. The festival did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Besides the ban in his native country, The Satanic Verses elicited a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death from Iran's Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini, forcing the author into hiding in 1989. He gradually resumed a normal life, especially after Iranian officials announced in 1998 that the government had no plans to enforce it. But his relative calm abruptly ended in 2022, when he was stabbed repeatedly onstage by a young assailant during a literary festival in western New York. Rushdie survived the attack, which left him blind in one eye, and wrote about it in the memoir Knife, a finalist this year for the National Book Award. On Friday, Khan's lawyer said that his client was an avid book reader driven to find answers after he found out the novel was banned. He filed numerous requests for information with various authorities — and tried for over a year to get a hold of the notification. Mukherjee said Khan was told by authorities that it was not traceable. 'When we realized there was no hope, we proceeded to go to court and challenge the notification,' Mukherjee added. The court also said that Khan has the right under law to procure this book. So how does he plan to get it now? 'He doesn't have a clear answer to this yet — if it becomes available in India, he will buy a copy of it,' Mukherjee said. 'But he can also potentially buy it from international booksellers online, as it's no longer illegal to import the book into the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-ban-on-rushdie-s-satanic-verses-may-end-thanks-to-missing-paperwork-/7857915.html	2024-11-09T01:47:56-08:00	
Berlin Wall, divide that once shaped German women's lives, echoes today	berlin — Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available. Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist. Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country's defeat in World War II in 1945. As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 — and the country's reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 — many in Germany are reflecting on how women's lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again — though some differences remain even today. 'In West Germany, women — not all, but many — had to fight for their right to have a career,' said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany. Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs — though that was something that 'they had been ordered from above to do,' she added. Front line of Cold War Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany. Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction. 'All the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,' Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. 'East Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.' By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were 'spoiled by the Marshall Plan' — the United States' generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war. In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or 'economic miracle,' that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war. That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women's quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family. Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenmütter, or uncaring moms who put work over family. Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive. 'I always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,' said Huth, now 69. 'It never really occurred to me to go to work.' A new generation More than three decades after Germany's unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood also has become the normal way of life. Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today. 'East or West — it's not even a topic in our family anymore,' she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city. She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female. 'I'm white and privileged — for good or worse — I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,' she said. Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung foundation. Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West. In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office. Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality. Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden. Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities. 'I can't imagine that there are any women who don't like to be independent,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7857886.html	2024-11-09T01:47:22-08:00	
As data center industry booms, English village becomes battleground	ABBOTS LANGLEY, England — Originally built to store crops from peasant farmers, the Tithe Barn on the edge of the English village of Abbots Langley was converted into homes that preserve its centuries of history. Now, its residents are fighting to stop a development next door that represents the future. A proposal to build a data center on a field across the road was rejected by local authorities amid fierce opposition from villagers. But it's getting a second chance from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is pursuing reforms to boost economic growth following his Labour party's election victory in July. Residents of Abbots Langley, 30 kilometers northwest of London, worry the facility will strain local resources and create noise and traffic that damages the character of the quiet village, which is home to more than 20,000 people. Off the main street there's a church with a stone tower built in the 12th century and, further down the road, a picturesque circular courtyard of rustic thatched-roof cottages that used to be a farm modeled on one built for French Queen Marie Antoinette. 'It's just hideously inappropriate,' said Stewart Lewis, 70, who lives in one of the converted houses in the 600-year-old Tithe Barn. 'I think any reasonable person anywhere would say, 'Hang on, they want a data center? This isn't the place for it.'' As the artificial intelligence boom fuels demand for cloud-based computing from server farms around the world, such projects are pitting business considerations, national priorities and local interests against each other. Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has stepped in to review the appeals filed by developers of three data center projects after they were rejected by local authorities, taking the decision out of the hands of town planners. Those proposals include Abbots Langley and two projects in Buckinghamshire, which sits west of London. The first decision is expected by January. The projects are controversial because the data centers would be built on 'greenbelt' land, which has been set aside to prevent urbanization. Rayner wants to tap the greenbelt for development, saying much of it is low quality. One proposed Buckinghamshire project, for example, involves redeveloping an industrial park next to a busy highway. 'Whilst it's officially greenbelt designated land, there isn't anything 'green' about the site today,' said Stephen Beard, global head of data centers at Knight Frank, a property consultancy that's working on the project. 'It's actually an eyesore which is very prominent from the M25' highway, he said. Greystoke, the company behind the Abbots Langley center and a second Buckinghamshire project to be built on a former landfill, didn't respond to requests for comment. In an online video for Abbots Langley, a company representative says, 'We have carried out a comprehensive search for sites, and this one is the very best.' It doesn't specify which companies would possibly use the center. The British government is making data centers a core element of its economic growth plans, deeming them 'critical national infrastructure' to give businesses confidence to invest in them. Starmer has announced deals for new centers, including a 10 billion pound ($13 billion) investment from private equity firm Blackstone to build what will be Europe's biggest AI data center in northeast England. The land for the Abbots Langley data center is currently used to graze horses. It's bordered on two other sides by a cluster of affordable housing and a highway. Greystoke's plans to construct two large buildings totaling 84,000 square meters and standing up to 20 meters tall have alarmed Lewis and other villagers, who worry that it will dwarf everything else nearby. They also doubt Greystoke's promise that it will create up to 260 jobs. 'Everything will be automated, so they wouldn't need people,' said tech consultant Jennifer Stirrup, 51, who lives in the area. Not everyone in the village is opposed. Retiree Bryan Power says he would welcome the data center, believing it would benefit the area in a similar way as another big project on the other side of the village, the Warner Bros.' Studio Tour featuring a Harry Potter exhibition. 'It'll bring some jobs, whatever. It'll be good. Yeah. No problem. Because if it doesn't come, it'll go somewhere else,' said Power, 56. One of the biggest concerns about data centers is their environmental impact, especially the huge amounts of electricity they need. Greystoke says the facility will draw 96 megawatts of 'IT load.' But James Felstead, director of a renewable energy company and Lewis' neighbor, said the area's power grid wouldn't be able to handle so much extra demand. It's a problem reflected across Europe, where data center power demand is expected to triple by the end of the decade, according to consulting firm McKinsey. While the AI-fueled data boom has prompted Google, Amazon and Microsoft to look to nuclear power as a source of clean energy, worries about their ecological footprint have already sparked tensions over data centers elsewhere. Google was forced to halt plans in September for a $200 million data center in Chile's capital, Santiago, after community complaints about its potential water and energy usage. In Ireland, where many Silicon Valley companies have European headquarters, the grid operator has temporarily halted new data centers around Dublin until 2028 over worries they're guzzling too much electricity. A massive data center project in northern Virginia narrowly won county approval last year, amid heavy opposition from residents concerned about its environmental impact. Other places like Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Singapore have imposed various restrictions on data centers. Public knowledge about the industry is still low but 'people are realizing more that these data centers are quite problematic,' said Sebastian Lehuede, a lecturer in ethics, AI and society at King's College London who studied the Google case in Chile. As awareness grows about their environmental impact, Lehuede said, 'I'm sure we will have more opposition from different communities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-data-center-industry-booms-english-village-becomes-battleground/7856298.html	2024-11-09T01:46:47-08:00	
Japan plans automated cargo transport system to relieve shortage of drivers and cut emissions	TOKYO — Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a 'conveyor belt road' by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers. The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries. A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an 'auto flow road,' in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s. 'We need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,' said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said. 'The key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,' Endo said. The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors. In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports. The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height and are 110 centimeters by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet. The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future. Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it's known as the '2024 problem.' Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association. That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it's moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile (1.6 kilometers). Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls. As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing. In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer. The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers. Trucks carry about 90% of Japan's cargo, and about 60% of Japan's fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems. 'That means the 2024 problem isn't just a transportation problem but really a people's problem,' Yano said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-plans-automated-cargo-transport-system-to-relieve-shortage-of-drivers-and-cut-emissions-/7856284.html	2024-11-09T01:46:15-08:00	
New Chinese stealth fighter to take center stage at China's biggest air show	SEOUL, south korea/BEIJING — China's new J-35A stealth fighter jet will be displayed for the first time next week at the country's biggest civil and military air show, a biennial event where Beijing showcases its expanding aerospace industry. The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition begins Tuesday in the southern Greater Bay city of Zhuhai. The 2022 edition of the event led to about $40 billion in 'cooperation agreements' being signed, according to its organizers. Developing domestic aerospace design and manufacturing capabilities is a major strategic priority for Beijing as it vies for regional military dominance with the U.S. amid escalating tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea. China also seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign imports, a concern borne out after the election as the next U.S. president this week of Donald Trump, who has been vocal about increasing trade tariffs and decoupling supply chains from the world's second-largest economy. Alongside drones, weapons systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technologies, China's emerging role as a commercial airliner manufacturer through state-owned planemaker COMAC will be on display. Fighter jet As the expected highlight of the show, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) will reveal to the public the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation's J-35A, which the air force last week described as a 'medium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter.' Russia has also flown its most advanced fighter jet, the SU-57, to Zhuhai for its first air show abroad, in an apparent message to the West about China-Russia cooperation. The J-35A, which uses airstrips to take off and land, is a variant of the J-35, a stealthy aircraft China is developing for use on aircraft carriers. Little is known about its performance or capabilities, although it superficially resembles the Lockheed Martin LMT.N F-35. The J-35 program is a follow-on from China's J-31 fighter, which made its public debut at the Zhuhai show in 2014 but was never used by the People's Liberation Army or sold to foreign customers. Diplomats and security analysts have closely watched the evolution of J-35 variants given the importance of the plane to China's aircraft carrier program, which seeks to expand jets' range and payload to project power beyond China's home waters. Monday marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF, which will have its largest presence at the air show, Xinhua news agency has reported. COMAC This year's Zhuhai air show is its first post-pandemic edition since Beijing lifted its zero-COVID policy and travel restrictions in 2023. Airbus AIR.PA and the world's third-largest planemaker, Embraer EMBR3.SA, will have a presence at the show, but Boeing BA.N will not be officially represented after new CEO Kelly Ortberg halted travel to industry events as the troubled U.S. manufacturer recovers from a damaging seven-week workers' strike that ended this week. Beijing has invested heavily in developing home-grown commercial planes, and engines that one day may replace the foreign versions that currently power COMAC's jets. COMAC-watchers will, in particular, be paying attention to a possible re-branding of the company's ARJ21 regional jet, after one was spotted by aviation enthusiasts in mid-October at a Chinese airport with C909 painted on its blue tail, instead of ARJ21. Although largely symbolic, the change -- which would align with the manufacturer's naming convention for its other models -- signals Beijing's growing intention to present itself as a full-scale alternative to Airbus and Boeing, which are both struggling to keep up with demand. Industry sources say COMAC is a long way off from making inroads internationally without benchmark certifications from the EU -- which COMAC is pursuing for its C919 airliner -- or the U.S. In particular, competing with Western engines poses one of the most daunting challenges for China's rising aerospace industry, even after a spate of industrial problems in the West. Even so, Chinese manufacturers will benefit from the sheer scale of their domestic market, analysts say. China is the world's second-largest domestic aviation market after the U.S. Boeing has said China will more than double its commercial airplane fleet and need 8,830 new planes by 2043.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-chinese-stealth-fighter-to-take-center-stage-at-china-s-biggest-air-show/7856275.html	2024-11-09T01:45:24-08:00	
Why Mozambique's election has sparked weeks of protests, violent crackdown by police	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country. The protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging. Opposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the October 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet. International rights groups say at least 20 people have been killed by police since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices. The internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked, according to Human Rights Watch. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it. What happened in the election? The candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on October 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years. Even before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, known as Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million. The European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies. Senior opposition figures killed Independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on October 18. The men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee. Growing protests Since then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms. Mondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests 'so that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.' Authorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests. Rights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard. A history of civil war and violence Mozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias. The country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. Mondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-mozambique-s-election-has-sparked-weeks-of-protests-violent-crackdown-by-police-/7856254.html	2024-11-09T01:44:51-08:00	
Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris shines in light show	paris — As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's — and arguably just as breathtaking. The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history. Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution. 'Paris Cœur de Lumières' (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until November 23, transforms the church's sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping. 'From a technological standpoint, it's a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,' director Damien Fontaine explained. 'We then 'unfold' it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It's ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.' Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience. The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history. Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history. Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV. 'She was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,' Dubosc said. 'I hadn't realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.' Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: 'It's exceptional. You lose track of what's happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.' Her historic costume shaped her performance — literally. 'I have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,' she said. 'You realize there's a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.' The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/church-of-saint-sulpice-in-paris-shines-in-an-immersive-light-show-/7853238.html	2024-11-09T01:44:21-08:00	
Ruby slippers from 'Wizard of Oz' are for sale nearly 2 decades after they were stolen	DALLAS — A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in 'The Wizard of Oz' is on the auction block nearly two decades after a thief stole the iconic shoes, convinced they were adorned with real jewels. Online bidding has started and will continue through December 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday. The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain. Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival. The funds will supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers. The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, was 76 when he was sentenced in January to time served because of his poor health. He admitting to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off 'one last score' after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. The auction of movie memorabilia includes other items from 'The Wizard of Oz,' such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West and the screen door from Dorothy's Kansas home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz-are-for-sale-nearly-2-decades-after-they-were-stolen/7853208.html	2024-11-09T01:43:36-08:00	
Russian drone attack on Ukraine's Odesa kills one, injures 13, governor says	kyiv, ukraine — Russian drones attacked Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa overnight, killing one person and injuring 13 others, including two boys, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Saturday. Several residential apartment buildings, private houses, commercial buildings and dozens of private cars were damaged in what was the second day in a row of Russian drone attacks on the city, Kiper said. 'At night the enemy again attacked Odesa and the nearby region with attack drones. One person died and 13 were wounded. Among the injured there were two children,' he said on the Telegram messaging app. Prosecutors said the children were boys aged 4 and 16. Russia launched 51 drones, focusing its attack on Odesa and the nearby region in the south of Ukraine, the Ukrainian air force said, adding that Ukrainian air defense units and mobile drone hunter groups shot down 32 Russian drones. It also said that 18 drones were 'lost,' most likely meaning they had been thwarted electronically. Russian drones also triggered a large fire in one of Odesa's districts, public broadcaster Suspilne reported, quoting residents. Other media outlets in the city posted video footage showing cars and buildings ablaze and thick smoke billowing skyward. As the war against Russia nears its 1,000-day mark, Moscow's forces have intensified air attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, sending swarms of drones almost every night. Ukraine's military said that Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets in October. Moscow says it does not target civilians. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had verified 11,743 civilian deaths in conflict-related violence from Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to the end of August this year. The Ukrainian government says the toll is likely to be much higher due to difficulties accessing parts of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-on-ukraine-s-odesa-kills-one-injures-13-governor-says/7857985.html	2024-11-09T01:41:29-08:00	
Gaza rescuers say 14 killed in Israeli strikes	Gaza Strip — Gaza's civil defense agency said Saturday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north. An airstrike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Yunis, killing at least nine people, civil defense spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP. The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital. A second air strike killed five people and injured about 22 when 'Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school,' which had been turned into a shelter for 'thousands of displaced people' in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said. The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added. In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed 'dozens of terrorists' in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added. The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. 'Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip,' the military said in a statement. 'Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers,' it added. Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. In that attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-rescuers-say-14-killed-in-israeli-strikes/7857976.html	2024-11-09T01:02:24-08:00	
Death toll rises to 20 in southwestern Pakistan rail station bombing	QUETTA, Pakistan — The death toll from a powerful bombing at a Quetta rail station in restive southwestern Pakistan on Saturday rose to at least 20, officials said. The attack also left more than 40 others wounded, some critically. The bomb exploded when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province, said Mohammad Baloch, a senior police officer. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad. Shahid Rind, a government spokesperson said the bombing seemed to have been a suicide attack, but an investigation was still ongoing to confirm the BLA's claim. TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform's roof blown apart and a tea stall destroyed as luggage littered the place. Ayesha Faiz, a Quetta police official, said some of the critically wounded passengers died at a hospital, raising the deaths. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack 'will pay a very heavy price for it,' adding that security forces were determined to eliminate 'the menace of terrorism.' The oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but also least populated province. It is also a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province. BLA often targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects. Last month, BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside the Karachi airport, killing two. Since then, Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working on multiple projects in Balochistan and other parts of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-20-in-southwestern-pakistan-rail-station-bombing/7857955.html	2024-11-08T22:47:56-08:00	
EV industry watching Musk's role in tariff fixing	New Delhi — The electric vehicle industry is closely watching to see how Tesla boss Elon Musk, who played a key role in the victory of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, will use his influence with the incoming president to steer the industry's future. At stake are several issues including the new administration's approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs and tax credits. In anticipation of decisions favorable to Tesla, shares in the company rose 27% after the election result was announced, taking its market capitalization to $1 trillion. During the campaign, Trump said he would increase tariffs on Chinese goods and roll back tax credits available to EV buyers in the U.S. He also vowed to reduce or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency, which support the EV industry. Industry analysts are divided on whether high tariffs on Chinese EVs are advantageous or disadvantageous for Tesla's business. Some analysts have suggested that Musk could persuade the Trump administration to reduce the tariffs on Chinese EVs and might even temper the overall tariff regime against Chinese goods. However, Musk is likely to support the elimination of the $7,500 tax credit given to EV buyers in the United States. The absence of tax credits would make it difficult for legacy carmakers to introduce EV versions of their cars in competition with Tesla. 'As Elon Musk played a very important role in funding Trump's campaign, he will no doubt have the ear of the U.S. president and play a role that will help shape policies that are advantageous to Tesla and his other businesses,' Bill Russo, founder and CEO of Automobility Limited, a Shanghai-based strategic consulting and investment platform, told VOA. To be sure, Musk opposed U.S. tariffs on China-made EVs last May. 'Neither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs. In fact, I was surprised when they were announced. Things that inhibit freedom of exchange or distort the market are not good,' Musk said after the Biden administration enhanced tariffs on Chinese EVs. The question is whether he will continue to oppose tariffs on Chinese EVs after Trump enters the White House. A section of analysts has predicted that Musk would continue this line of argument because China accounts for one-third of Tesla sales. 'Tesla is in China because Elon Musk needs the scale and efficient cost structure of the Chinese supply chain to make the company more competitive around the world,' Russo said. China makes over 70% of the EV batteries in the world and almost two-thirds of all EVs and related components. 'Tariffs make accessing this supply chain more costly, and that does not help Tesla,' he said. Between January and May this year, Tesla sold almost as many cars in China as it did in the United States. Chinese consumers bought one-third of Tesla cars of all models totaling 513,644. In the same period, the company sold 522,444 vehicles in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives argued that higher tariffs would help Tesla compete better with Chinese EVs in the U.S. market. 'Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,' Ives said in a note to clients this week. Taking a different view, Beatrix C. Keim, director of Germany-based Centre Automotive Research, said the next president is unlikely to listen to arguments for reducing tariffs on Chinese EVs. 'There is a 100% tariff for Chinese EVs in place. I don't think that Trump will weaken this,' she said. The high tariff does not affect Tesla because it does not export cars from its Shanghai plant for the U.S. market, and builds them in the U.S. Keim said Musk will do whatever serves Tesla's business in China. 'Chinese people are very likely to react emotionally if he is perceived as acting against China's interest,' she said. 'Chinese customers had once blocked the sales of Tesla cars, and this can happen again.' Musk said last April that he loved the Chinese people. 'I'm a big fan of China. I also have a lot of fans in China. Well, the feelings are reciprocated,' Musk, who has often been described in Chinese social media as a 'friend of China,' said in April. Tesla is set to introduce a new fully self-driving (FSD - Supervised) car in the coming months, though the vehicle's safety remains under review. Musk must have sufficient influence in both Washington and Beijing to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to sell it. 'China is likely to approve FSD as it would like to show goodwill toward foreign technology,' Russo said. However, Tesla's FSD may have a limited market in China where local manufacturers play a much bigger role. Keim said Tesla's FSD might not face regulatory challenges in Europe, but it may be difficult for it to find enough customers in the face of local competition. One of the questions that is often asked is whether China would retaliate by imposing higher tariffs on American goods, including Tesla. 'This is very unlikely, as Tesla has invested in China and is used as an example of how foreign brands are still welcome in China, and Tesla is held up as a benchmark for Chinese companies to measure against,' Russo said. 'Killing competition is not viewed as healthy for the forward development of the Chinese automakers. This is in stark contrast to the way the U.S. has acted so far.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ev-industry-watching-musk-s-role-in-tariff-fixing/7857946.html	2024-11-08T21:59:30-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki unleashes towering columns of hot clouds	MAUMERE, Indonesia — Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano spewed towering columns of hot ash high into the air Saturday, days after a huge eruption killed nine people and injured dozens of others. Activity at the volcano on the remote island of Flores, in East Nusa Tenggara province, has increased since Monday's initial eruption. On Thursday, authorities expanded the danger zone as the volcano erupted again. Friday's activity saw the largest column of ash so far recorded at 10 kilometers high, Hadi Wijaya, the head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, told a news conference. Wijaya said volcanic materials, including smoldering rocks, lava, and hot, thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 8 kilometers from the crater on Friday. There were no casualties reported from the latest eruption as the 1,584-meter volcano shot billowing columns of ash at least three times Saturday, rising up to 9 kilometers, the volcano monitoring agency said. Authorities increased Lewotobi Laki Laki's alert status to the highest level since Monday, and expanded the danger zone on Thursday to a radius of 8 kilometers on the northwest and southwest sides of the mountain slope. 'We are still evaluating how far the (danger zone) radius should be expanded,' Wijaya said. Hot clouds of ash 'are currently spreading in all directions.' The volcanic activity has damaged schools and thousands of houses and buildings, including convents, churches and a seminary on the majority-Catholic island. Craters left by rocks falling from the eruptions measured up to 13 meters wide and 5 meters deep, experts found. Authorities have warned the thousands of people who fled the area not to return home, as the government planned to evacuate about 16,000 residents out of the danger zone. The series of eruptions throughout the week have already affected more than 10,000 people in 14 villages, with more than half moving into makeshift emergency shelters. A total of 2,384 houses and public facilities were damaged or had collapsed after tons of volcanic material hit the buildings, said Kanesius Didimus, head of a local disaster management agency. It also destroyed a main road connecting East Flores district where the mountain is located to neighboring Larantuka district. Rescue workers, police and soldiers searched devastated areas to ensure all residents had been moved out from the danger zone. Logistic and relief supplies were provided to about 10,700 displaced people in eight evacuation sites as of Saturday. The National Disaster Management Agency said residents of the hardest-hit villages would be relocated within six months, and each family waiting to be rehoused would be compensated 500,000 rupiah ($32) per month. About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Fransiskus Xaverius Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed due to seismic activity. Three other airports in neighboring districts of Ende, Larantuka and Bajawa have been closed since Monday after Indonesia's Air Navigation issued a safety warning due to volcanic ash. Lewotobi Laki Laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province, known locally as the husband-and-wife mountains. 'Laki laki' means man, while its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman. It's one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-mount-lewotobi-laki-laki-unleashes-towering-columns-of-hot-clouds-/7857943.html	2024-11-08T21:34:18-08:00	
Pompeii archaeological park sets daily visitors' limit to combat over-tourism	ROME — The Pompeii archaeological park plans to limit visitor numbers to 20,000 a day and introduce personalized tickets starting next week in a bid to cope with over-tourism and protect the world heritage site, officials said Friday. The move comes after what authorities called a record summer that saw more than 4 million people visiting the world-famous remains of the ancient Roman city, buried under ash and rock following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. The park's director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said visitors to the main archaeological site now exceed an average of 15,000 to 20,000 every day, and the new daily cap will prevent the numbers from surging further. 'We are working on a series of projects to lift the human pressure on the site, which could pose risks both for visitors and the heritage (that is) so unique and fragile,' Zuchtriegel said. Starting November 15 tickets to access the park will be personalized to include the full names of visitors. A maximum of 20,000 tickets will be released each day, with different time slots during the peak summer season. The park's management is also trying to attract more tourists to visit other ancient sites connected to Pompeii by a free shuttle bus under the 'Greater Pompeii' project, including Stabia, Torre Annunziata and Boscoreale sites. 'The measures to manage flows and safety and the personalization of the visits are part of this strategy,' Zuchtriegel said. 'We are aiming for slow, sustainable, pleasant and non-mass tourism and above all widespread throughout the territory around the UNESCO site, which is full of cultural jewels to discover,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pompeii-archaeological-park-sets-daily-visitors-limit-to-combat-over-tourism/7857940.html	2024-11-08T21:25:48-08:00	
US to send contactors to Ukraine to repair, maintain US weapons	The United States will send a small number of contractors to Ukraine to help it maintain and repair the U.S.-provided weapons and air defense systems it is using against Russia’s invasion, a defense official said Friday. The official said the contractors 'will be far from the front lines and they will not be fighting Russian forces.' Ukraine needs the contractors to repair and maintain equipment, such as F-16s and Patriot air defense systems, that requires 'specific technical expertise to maintain,' the official said. The decision to send the contractors was made 'after careful risk assessment,' the official said. On Wednesday, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him on his election victory, Trump had Elon Musk join the call. The billionaire businessman was a contributor to Trump’s presidential campaign. A Ukrainian official told The Associated Press that Zelenskyy thanked Musk for helping Ukraine gain access to the Starlink satellite internet platform. Other media outlets reported that Trump told Zelenskyy that he would support Ukraine, and that Musk said he would continue to supply Starlink. Musk was on the phone for only part of the conversation. Overnight attacks Ukrainian officials said Friday morning that Russia attacked the regions of Odesa, Kharkiv and Kyiv overnight into Friday with drones, missiles and aerial bombs, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and killing at least one person and injuring at least 25. Regional officials in Kharkiv say a Russian guided aerial bomb struck a 12-story residential building in the early hours Friday. They said the bomb struck the first three floors. A search was underway for anyone trapped in the rubble. In Odesa, police and emergency service officials told the French news agency Agence France-Presse that a Russian drone struck several residential buildings, sparking fires in some. They said a 46-year-old man was killed when his car was struck by shrapnel, and at least nine others were injured. The Odesa officials reported shrapnel from the attacks also ruptured fuel lines, causing several fires. On the social media platform X, President Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces shot down four missiles and about 60 drones launched by Russia against Ukraine overnight Thursday. 'Each time Russia attempts to destroy our lives, it is crucial to respond collectively and decisively at the international level to reduce and block the potential for terror,' Zelenskyy wrote. 'Ukraine needs strength to achieve this. This is the only way to achieve a just peace and to ending the killing of our people,' he said. He called for more air defenses, and long-range capabilities, weapons packages, and sanctions against Russia. Zelenskyy took that message Thursday to the European Political Community Summit in Budapest, where he met with European leaders and reportedly reached new defense agreements to strengthen Ukrainian forces, along with agreements on positive steps toward reinforcing air defenses before winter. But while most European leaders signaled continued support for Ukraine’s war effort, there were indications that Trump’s victory in the U.S. elections this week could change that picture. In a radio interview Friday, the host of that summit, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties to both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said U.S. support for Ukraine will end with the election of Trump and that Europe needs to re-think its approach to the war. 'The Americans will quit this war,' Orban told Hungarian state radio and indicated he felt Europe must follow suit. 'Europe cannot finance this war alone, there are some who still want it, who still want to continue sending enormous amounts of money into this lost war, but the number of those who remain silent, though they were loud before, and those who cautiously voice that we should adjust to the new situation, is growing,' Orban said. The Hungarian leader made the comments ahead of the European Union summit Friday in Budapest. Before that meeting, outgoing European Council President Charles Michel told reporters Europe wants to strengthen ties with the United States and continue strengthening Ukraine. 'We have to support Ukraine because if we do not support Ukraine, this is the wrong signal that we send to Putin but also to some other authoritarian regimes across the world,' Michel said. Trump has criticized the level of U.S. support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, and before the election he promised to end the conflict before even taking office, without explaining how. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-send-contactors-to-ukraine-to-repair-maintain-us-weapons/7857926.html	2024-11-08T19:31:36-08:00	
Will Indonesia's Prabowo move closer to Trump, Xi or both?	Washington — Indonesia's newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto set off for China on Friday for his first international trip as president. 'From Beijing I will fly directly to Washington, D.C., on the invitation of the U.S. president,' said Prabowo upon departing Jakarta. Indonesians often refer to public figures by their first names. His tour aims to 'cultivate good relations with all parties,' Prabowo said. He has stated his ambition to raise Indonesia's international profile and made early foreign policy moves, including a surprise decision to join Southeast Asia's largest economy to the BRICS bloc. BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, comprises a growing group of emerging economies and is seen as a counterweight to the West. In October, the group added Indonesia as one of its 13 new 'partner countries.' The move is a shift away from the position taken by Prabowo's predecessor, Joko Widodo, who took in massive amounts of infrastructure investments from Beijing but remained mostly nonaligned geopolitically. Prabowo's visit comes during a transitional period at the White House, ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump in January. The White House has not formally announced the visit; however, Jakarta said Prabowo is scheduled to meet U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House early next week. Indonesian diplomatic sources who spoke under condition of anonymity told VOA that Prabowo has requested a meeting with Trump. The Trump team has not responded to VOA's query on whether it will be granted. New period of US-Indonesia ties Starting in January, both countries will be under the helm of leaders who were democratically elected but have employed authoritarian rhetoric, at a time when Washington is focused on its rivalry with the authoritarian regime in China under Xi Jinping. Like Trump, Prabowo made a historical political comeback under unlikely circumstances. He secured a landslide victory after two failed attempts, 26 years after his father-in-law, President Suharto, was ousted from power. This, despite Prabowo admitting he was ordered by Suharto in 1998 to abduct activists protesting the regime. Washington was aware of Prabowo's involvement, and the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations denied Prabowo entry to the U.S., citing human rights concerns. The Trump administration lifted the visa ban and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper invited then-Defense Minister Prabowo to Washington in 2020. With Trump in the White House, analysts say, Jakarta could see more opportunities to expand ties with Washington if Prabowo makes inroads through the right people for the right incentives, given Trump's history of relying more on personal connections than institutional relationships. Personal connections Jakarta's point person for Washington under the first Trump administration was Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, a businessman and retired four-star army general who then served as coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment. Luhut developed close ties with Adam Boehler, head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and a former college roommate of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. In 2020, Boehler dangled the promise of a $2 billion investment into Indonesia's planned sovereign wealth fund. The plan fell through because the price, recognition of Israel under the Trump administration's Abraham Accords, was too high for Jakarta, according to an interview Boehler gave to Bloomberg at the end of 2020. In Prabowo's administration, Luhut holds the position of head of the National Economic Council and special adviser on investment affairs. But in a Cabinet of more than 100 officials, his influence has diminished. 'The deck is being shuffled right now, and we don't know yet where the cards will land,' said Yeremia Lalisang, assistant professor of international relations at the University of Indonesia. What's clear, Lalisang told VOA, is that the 'pragmatic' Prabowo will be delighted to be welcomed by Trump after being treated as a 'human rights criminal' by previous U.S. administrations. One possibility to bolster ties under Trump would be for Prabowo to capitalize on the connection between billionaires among Trump's inner circle. This would include Trump's wealthiest backer, Elon Musk, and Hary Tanoesoedibjo, an Indonesian tycoon who has partnered with the Trump family on several real estate projects in Indonesia. Both were at Trump's residence in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, Tuesday night, celebrating his election victory. Tanoesoedibjo, who commonly goes by his initials H.T., would not confirm whether he is facilitating a Trump-Prabowo meeting next week. However, he said, Trump's victory would bring 'positive hope for Indonesia.' 'Trump's favorable understanding of Indonesia should be maximalized for the economic benefit of both countries, especially Indonesia's economic interests,' H.T. told VOA. Investing in nickel Under Jokowi's administration, Jakarta courted Musk, head of SpaceX and Tesla, to invest in two key areas: satellites and electric vehicle batteries. Earlier this year, Musk launched SpaceX's satellite internet service, Starlink, in Bali and Maluku. With the Earth's largest reserves of nickel, Indonesia is eager to develop its EV battery industry, and Prabowo is expected to continue his predecessor's yearslong effort to lure Tesla to invest. The Biden administration has put aside tens of billions of dollars in tax credits to spur the U.S. EV industry, under the Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate and energy legislation. To qualify for the credit, 40% of the minerals used for battery production for EVs sold in the U.S. must be extracted or processed domestically or in one of its free-trade partners. Jakarta has been pushing for a limited free-trade agreement that will allow it to benefit from IRA tax credits. However, its nickel industry is backed by investment from Chinese companies and besieged by environmental concerns, limiting its access to the U.S. market. 'You might see some of this calculus change during the course of the Trump administration,' said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow for the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump has vowed to loosen environmental restrictions. U.S.-Indonesia cooperation on nickel is 'out there as an objective,' said Ann Marie Murphy, senior research scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University. 'If it fails to come to fruition, I think that could be disappointing to both sides,' she told VOA. However, Trump, who has made high tariffs on China a central theme of his campaign, will be looking closely at the tariffs' impact on the EV industry. He has vowed to roll back tax credits available to EV buyers in the U.S. He will also be watching bilateral trade deficits. In 2017, his administration placed Indonesia on a watchlist of countries that have a large trade surplus, threatening Jakarta with unspecified consequences if trade was not brought into balance. 'There's lots of question marks here that we still need to wait and see to get answers,' Natalegawa told VOA.

Judge pauses court deadlines in Trump's 2020 election interference case	A U.S. judge has set aside all the pending court deadlines President-elect Donald Trump is facing for his 2020 election interference case. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan approved the request for the move Friday by Special Counsel Jack Smith, the prosecutor in the criminal case against the president-elect. Smith's team said in its request for the delay that it needs 'time to assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.' Sitting presidents, according to Justice Department policy, cannot be prosecuted. Now it seems that as Trump is on the verge of assuming the country's highest office again, following his victory this week over Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, the presidential office could shield Trump from facing charges stemming from what has become known as the Capitol riot. Chutkan has instructed the prosecutors to file their court papers with their proposed way forward in the case against Trump by December 2. Trump has always maintained that he has immunity from prosecution. In July, the Supreme Court ruled that former presidents do have broad immunity from prosecution and kicked the case back to Chutkan for her to determine how the case against the former president could proceed. Trump's lawyers were scheduled to respond by November 21 to Smith's argument that the case could still proceed because most of the activities Trump was accused of came in his role as a candidate for re-election, not as president. On January 6, 2021, Trump and his supporters sought to prevent Joe Biden from assuming the presidency. Biden had defeated then-President Trump in the 2020 election, but on Inauguration Day, after Trump delivered a fiery speech, his supporters surged the Capitol as lawmakers were set to certify the presidential election results. More than 1,000 of Trump's supporters have been convicted for their participation in the riot. Despite the violent images that have emerged from that day, including insurrectionists beating police officers, Trump has continued to characterize his supporters as 'patriots' and has said he would pardon many of them if elected. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-pauses-court-deadlines-in-trump-s-2020-election-interference-case-/7857610.html	2024-11-08T16:24:11-08:00	
China’s police seize assets, demand payments amid economic downturn	washington — Zhang Ke, not his real name, has been hiding from police in the southern megalopolis of Guangzhou since September. He said he had not committed a crime but was dodging authorities to avoid extortion by police from another city more than 1,400 kilometers away in northern China. In July, Zhang said his life was turned upside down when all of his bank accounts were frozen by the Nanle County Public Security Bureau in Henan province. Zhang told VOA Mandarin that police demanded $55,000 — nearly all the money he has earned from his sports lottery distributor business — in exchange for having the freeze lifted. According to Zhang and posts by others on China’s social media, he is not the only one being targeted and fleeced by police. As China’s economy struggles and economic pressures constrain local government budgets, law enforcement officers have been using flexible legal codes and financial punishments to fill government coffers, analysts say. Reports circulating on Chinese social media detailed nearly 10,000 incidents in which companies in Guangzhou province alone had their assets frozen or removed from bank accounts by police. Zhang’s business was one of them. Two years ago, Zhang began selling services to clients on social media. Buyers would pay him to gamble on their behalf instead of going to stores in person. If the tickets won, he would wire them the money. Chinese law regulates the sale of physical lottery tickets, but Zhang's business exists in a legal gray area. Chinese law forbids the sale of sports lottery tickets online. Zhang's company does not distribute physical tickets to his customers. However, law enforcement has subjectively interpreted the law to target Zhang and his company. The lack of clarity and standards for interpretation, Zhang said, provides these cross-provincial police officers an opportunity to 'incriminate tens of thousands of store owners' like himself as a means of profit generation. Internet users have begun using the catchphrase 'offshore fishing' to describe the extralegal police practice of arresting, freezing or transferring the assets of private enterprises and individuals in another province. Zhang said he has met many other lottery distributors who were also subjected to undue financial punishments. 'The police asked them for money and the money was then transferred to the policemen's personal accounts, not to the public security bureau's corporate accounts,' he said. Teng Biao, a visiting professor at Hunter College, told VOA that 'offshore fishing' does not properly enforce laws across provinces but rather generates revenue for police and local governments. 'A lot of private enterprises, including many small-business owners, are facing an extremely bad legal and political environment. There are so many gray areas in China’s legal system that it’s almost impossible for businesses to fully align with the law. Combined with China's imperfect and distorted market system, it is very easy for the police to find an excuse to crack down on the entrepreneurs,' he said. Teng attributed the prevalence of 'offshore fishing' to China’s economic downturn. 'The local governments used to rely on selling land for financial resources. But the economic downturn and crippled property market stripped them of that option. That provides an incentive for frequent cross-provincial law enforcement, the so-called ‘offshore fishing,’ ' he said. Many lottery sellers, including Zhang, have been forced to pay money to avoid jail time, he told VOA. 'If you don't give the police money, you're going to be locked up. Some lottery sellers pay the fine on the same day they are questioned, and get released right away, and never hear from the police again. If you don’t do what they say, you’re locked up until you give in,' he said. Last month, the director of the National Development and Reform Commission responsible for planning China’s economy, Zheng Shajie, talked about the issue of 'offshore fishing' at a press conference and called for the standardization of law enforcement. 'Law enforcement must not cross regional boundaries in violation of regulations, nor should it be conducted for profit,' he said. Local police departments have also taken steps to address the issue. Jiubao police station in the eastern city of Hangzhou, a business hub for many of China’s e-commerce merchants, issued a public notice in August, saying: 'Non-local police are forbidden to enforce laws in Jiubao unless they’re accompanied by local police. Film and call the local police if you find them illegally entering your property.' Zhang said he called all the anti-corruption hotlines but never received a reply. 'I have no other choice. I have tried everything. I probably will give up the fight in the end. Now I know what it feels like to have no freedom, and I finally understand why all those wealthy Chinese businessmen move to other countries,' he said. 'I don't want to live in China anymore. I want to learn English and go to work abroad, and even if I drive a taxi for the rest of my life, I will take it. I don't want to live in this land of China anymore; it's disgusting,' Zhang told VOA. VOA tried to reach Puyang Public Security Bureau authorities in Henan province by phone, but the calls went unanswered.

Turkish authorities ban screening of LGBTQI-themed film 'Queer'	Washington/Istanbul — Local authorities in Turkey's metropolitan Istanbul province banned a screening of the LGBTQI-themed movie 'Queer' on Thursday because of concerns that it would endanger public peace and security. The screening of 'Queer,' a film directed by Italian director Luca Guadagnino and starring Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey, was scheduled to open a film festival in Istanbul's Kadikoy district on Thursday. The festival was organized by Mubi, an international streaming platform and film production and distribution company. Mubi canceled the entire festival, noting 'This ban not only targets a single film but also undermines the very essence and purpose of the festival.' In a statement shared on X, Mubi announced that the Kadikoy District Governor's Office had notified them of the ban hours before the festival was set to begin. 'The decision states that the film is prohibited on the grounds that it contains provocative content that could endanger public peace, with the ban being imposed for security reasons,' Mubi wrote. 'We believe this ban is a direct restriction on art and freedom of expression,' Mubi added. The Kadikoy District Governor's Office has not made a public statement on the ban and has not responded to VOA's inquiry at the time of this story's publication. Rising anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric The Turkish government has toughened rhetoric against its LGBTQI+ community in recent years, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly calling its members 'perverts' or 'deviants.' Authorities have banned pride marches throughout the country since 2015, citing security concerns. At least 15 people were detained in Istanbul in June for taking part in a pride rally. Yıldız Tar, editor in chief of the LGBTQI news portal KaosGL, does not find the ban surprising considering the government's anti-LGBTQI stance. 'The reason for the ban on 'Queer' is of course that it is a film about LGBTI+ people. When you try to organize any LGBTI+-themed event in Turkey since 2015, you already encounter such bans,' Tar told VOA. Tar noted that the Kadikoy District Governor's Office banned the screening of another movie, 'Pride,' as part of Pride Month events in June 2023. The Istanbul festival, which was scheduled to take place November 7 to 10, included a variety of film screenings, talks and performances. According to Mubi, tickets for the festival had sold out days in advance. Tar views Mubi's decision to cancel the festival after the ban as 'an important and valuable message' and argues that the platform's decision should be exemplary. 'If LGBTI+ themed films are being censored so openly at this point, then festivals and the world of culture and arts need to raise a very strong voice against this censorship,' Tar said. Academic and film critic Yeşim Burul also sees the district governor's ban as censorship. 'We are talking about unacceptable censorship here. It is truly absurd that a district governorship would make such decisions to prevent a film from reaching the audience,' Burul told VOA. 'We, as adults, can decide which film we can and cannot watch. Such festivals are already organized for those over the age of 18, and tickets are sold that way,' Burul added. The 2024 film 'Queer,' with a screenplay adapted from William S. Burroughs' 1985 novel, tells the story of an American expatriate living in Mexico City in the 1950s who establishes an intimate connection with a younger man. In October, Mubi acquired distribution rights for the film in multiple territories, including Turkey, India, the United Kingdom, Germany and Latin America. Reactions Several rights groups and organizations reacted to the ban on the screening. According to the LGBTI+ Rights Commission of the Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association, the ban is 'a continuation of criminalizing LGBTI+ individuals.' In a post on X, the rights group argued that the ban violates not only domestic law but also the 'protection from discrimination' principle of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory. The Actors' Union of Turkey called the ban 'clearly an application of censorship.' 'The duty of art and artists is to broaden the horizons of societies and offer them new perspectives while telling their own stories,' the union said in a statement published on X. The union also reminded that the law on freedom of expression protects artistic activities in Turkey.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7857598.html	2024-11-08T14:52:44-08:00	
Who is Trump’s new chief of staff? Susie Wiles will be 1st woman to hold post	With her appointment as chief of staff to President-elect Donald Trump, Susie Wiles moves from a largely behind-the-scenes role of campaign co-chair to one of the most prominent positions in a new White House administration. The 67-year-old will become the first woman to serve in the post for any U.S. president when she assumes the role as the president's closest adviser in January. In announcing his decision Thursday, Trump said Wiles is 'tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected.' It was his first appointment since winning Tuesday’s election against Vice President Kamala Harris. 'It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,' Trump said in his statement. Wiles largely avoided the spotlight during her time as co-chair of Trump’s successful election campaign and was credited — along with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita — with bringing some discipline to Trump’s free-wheeling, off-script campaign style. She didn’t speak during Trump’s victory celebration early Wednesday morning when he called her to the podium, and she refused to take the microphone. Wiles rarely gives televised interviews and tends to avoid the spotlight, a contrast with LaCivita, who is known for being outspoken. For someone of her stature, she is not well-known in political circles. During his victory speech, Trump referred to Wiles as the 'ice maiden.' She is one of Trump’s most trusted advisers. During a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, earlier this month, he said: 'She’s incredible. Incredible.' Top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio told Politico in April, 'There is nobody, I think, that has the wealth of information that she does. Nobody in our orbit. Nobody.' While Wiles is a somewhat enigmatic figure, she has a long career of working behind the scenes in U.S. politics. Shortly after she graduated from the University of Maryland in 1979, she went to work for New York Congressman Jack Kemp and joined Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in 1980. She eventually moved to Florida where she advised the campaigns of two Florida mayors and helped then-businessman Rick Scott transition to politics in his successful 2010 campaign for governor. She managed Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr.’s presidential bid in 2012, and managed Florida for Trump’s 2016 campaign. She joined Ron DeSantis’ race for governor in 2018, but she parted ways with him after a falling out in 2019. Wiles made a rare appearance on social media shortly before DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race in January. 'Bye, bye,' she wrote. She went on to run Trump’s primary campaign against DeSantis, which Trump easily won. Wiles is the only campaign manager to survive an entire Trump campaign and is known for her ability to tamp down his mercurial, sometimes volatile behavior. In one anecdote reported by The Associated Press, during a campaign speech in Pennsylvania when Trump strayed off his talking points and quipped about not minding if members of the media were shot, she came out and silently stared at him until he got back on track. That ability should serve her well in her new role. In his last four years in office, Trump went through four chiefs of staff, a record for modern presidents. Some information in this report was provided by The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-trump-s-new-chief-of-staff-/7857567.html	2024-11-08T14:16:00-08:00	
Amsterdam bans rallies after Israeli soccer fans attacked	amsterdam — Amsterdam banned demonstrations for three days from Friday after overnight attacks on Israeli soccer supporters by what the mayor called 'antisemitic hit-and-run squads,' and Israel sent planes to the Netherlands to fly fans home. Mayor Femke Halsema said Maccabi Tel Aviv fans had been 'attacked, abused and pelted with fireworks' around the city, and that riot police intervened to protect them and escort them to hotels. At least five people were treated in a hospital. Videos on social media showed riot police in action, with some attackers shouting anti-Israeli slurs. Footage also showed Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters chanting anti-Arab slogans before Thursday evening's match. 'We saw a lot of demonstrations, a lot of people running. It was really, really terrifying,' said Joni Pogrebetsy, an Israeli soccer fan in Amsterdam for the match. Antisemitic incidents have surged in the Netherlands since Israel launched its assault on the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after the attacks on Israel by Hamas militants in October last year, with many Jewish organizations and schools reporting threats and hate mail. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government sent planes to the Netherlands to bring fans home, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar flew to Amsterdam for impromptu meetings with the Dutch government and far-right leader Geert Wilders. Amsterdam banned demonstrations through the weekend and gave police emergency stop-and-search powers in response to the unrest, which exposed deep anger over the Gaza-Israel conflict. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed and millions displaced in Israel's military offensive on Gaza, according to health officials there. The offensive was launched after Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostage in the initial cross-border attack, according to Israel. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. In Washington, U.S. President Biden condemned the attacks as 'despicable' and said they 'echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted.' United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was shocked by the violence in Amsterdam, a U.N. spokesperson said. Security tightened Mayor Halsema said police had been taken by surprise after security services failed to flag the match against Ajax Amsterdam, traditionally identified as a Jewish club, as high-risk. 'Antisemitic hit-and-run squads' had managed to evade a force of around 200 officers, she said. Security was tightened in the city, where a service was planned at a Jewish monument on Saturday to remember Kristallnacht, the Nazi pogrom against Jews across Germany on Nov. 9-10, 1938. A video verified by Reuters showed a group of men running near Amsterdam central station, chasing and assaulting other men as police sirens sounded. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was 'horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens' and had assured Netanyahu by phone that 'the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoke with Dutch King Willem-Alexander, who he said had 'expressed deep horror and shock.' Herzog quoted the king as saying the Netherlands had failed its Jewish community during World War II — under Nazi occupation and persecution — and again on Thursday night. Anti-Muslim politician Wilders, head of the largest party in the government, said he was 'ashamed that this can happen in the Netherlands.' In a post on X, he blamed 'criminal Muslims' and said they should be deported. Police said there had been incidents before the game, for which 3,000 Maccabi supporters traveled to Amsterdam. Israel says violence recalls European pogroms The Israeli Embassy in The Hague said mobs had chanted anti-Israel slogans and shared videos of their violence on social media, 'kicking, beating, even running over Israeli citizens.' 'On the eve of Kristallnacht — when Jews in Nazi Germany faced brutal attacks — it is horrifying to witness antisemitic violence on the streets of Europe once again,' it said. Police said 62 suspects had been detained after the game as pro-Palestinian demonstrators tried to reach the Johan Cruyff Arena, even though the city had forbidden a protest there. Ten remained in custody on Friday. They said fans had left the stadium without incident after the Europa League match, which Ajax won 5-0, but that clashes erupted overnight in the city center. Herzog was among senior Israeli politicians who said the violence recalled the attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen last year as well as attacks on European Jews in the pogroms of previous centuries. 'We see with horror this morning, the shocking images and videos that since October 7th, we had hoped never to see again: an anti-Semitic pogrom currently taking place against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and Israeli citizens in the heart of Amsterdam,' he wrote on X. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said that the mass killing by Israeli forces in Gaza and lack of international intervention to stop it 'is likely to lead to such spontaneous repercussions.' 'This emphasizes that stopping the genocide in Gaza is an essential part of respecting and protecting human rights, as well as ensuring regional and global security and peace,' he told Reuters. The Gaza war has led to protests in support of both sides across Europe and the United States, and both Jews and Arabs have been attacked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amsterdam-bans-demonstrations-after-israeli-soccer-fans-attacked/7857473.html	2024-11-08T13:13:46-08:00	
In Morocco, politics limited sermons, including about war in Middle East	rabat, morocco — Politicians and activists in Morocco are questioning limitations imposed on preachers regarding what they may say about war in the Middle East during sermons. During a meeting at the country's parliament this week, socialist lawmaker Nabila Mounib bemoaned the way that imams were curtailed in how they can speak about the plight of Palestinians and call for religious struggle to support their cause. 'No imam can speak about the Palestinian issue,' Mounib claimed on Tuesday. 'Today no one is demanding jihad for our brothers in Palestine.' In Morocco, imams are employed by the state and their sermons cannot be overtly political. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs has said discussion of the Israel-Hamas war is permitted. Yet activists are still worried about de facto limits placed on preaching about Palestinians. The question first arose in October 2023 after a document circulated on social media claiming to outline such limits. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs said in a statement that preaching about the suffering of Palestinians was authorized and that the document was fake. In an interview with Moroccan news website Anfas Press on Friday, Mounib said she had intended to denounce efforts to prevent imams from preaching about Palestinians but had not said imams should call for jihad from their pulpits. 'Jihad,' which means struggle or effort in Arabic, can denote striving to live in accordance with the path of God, either through internally finding one's faith or externally fighting for Islamic principles like justice. However, it can be interpreted in more militant terms as 'holy war' and has been used by some as a religious concept to recruit volunteers to fight since the Soviet-Afghanistan war began in 1979. The debate centers on whether imams should be allowed to invoke jihad in regard to the war between Israel and Hamas. Minister of Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq has denied Mounib's claim that preachers cannot broach the Israel-Hamas war, but he acknowledged and defended the prohibition on calls for jihad. 'Any imam who talks about barbarism and injustice and denounces them is welcome, but calling for jihad is something else,' he said. Explaining the prohibition this week, Toufiq cautioned that there were different interpretations of jihad. Yet to some pro-Palestinian activists in Morocco, the limitations are less about jihad and more about the tensions between state and society that have simmered since the war began. 'Imams have a right to take a stand and, in Islam, even have a duty,' Ahmed Wehman of the Moroccan Observatory for Anti-Normalization told The Associated Press. 'The government has nothing to do with Moroccan public opinion. They do not represent Morocco and Moroccans.' Morocco has one of the region's most historically significant Jewish communities and was one of four Arab states to normalize ties with Israel in 2020. But tens of thousands of protesters have regularly taken to the streets of its major cities throughout the 14-month war, protesting Israel's actions and demanding Morocco cut diplomatic ties. Many governments dictate what preachers can say from the pulpit in Muslim-majority countries, including Morocco, which has long worked to describe its brand of Islam to the world as a moderating force. Doing so is among authorities' strategies to curb extremism but can at times push believers to look for spiritual guidance outside the government-controlled religious sphere. Francesco Cavatorta, a political science professor at Université Laval in Quebec, said countries like Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria have historically exerted control over imams to control the narrative of religion and ensure sermons don't undermine national stability. In Morocco, he said, the regulation is 'part of an effort to be seen as a country that is a Muslim country but a tolerant country and a welcoming country.' Morocco has this year suspended preachers who veer from directives. Its Ministry of Islamic Affairs publishes guidance for imams on Wednesdays, two days before Friday prayers. The content of sermons has in the past pitted the government against activists. In 2017, when anti-government protests were sweeping Morocco's north, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs directed preachers to reproach activists for promoting division among Muslims, the online news outlet Le Desk reported. Nasser Zefzafi, the country's most famous political prisoner, was arrested later that year after interrupting a sermon about the protests, shouting a question about whether mosques served God or the monarchy. Morocco's Ministry of Islamic Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. Imams throughout the Middle East and North Africa have regularly referenced the war since October 2023, including in countries where the government oversees their sermons. 'The way to eliminate oppression and evil, no matter where it is in the world, is through the unity and solidarity of Muslims,' Ali Erbas, the head of the Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs, said in a Friday sermon delivered in Azerbaijan. 'When Muslims act together with the consciousness of brotherhood and the spirit of solidarity, all people will find peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-morocco-politics-limited-sermons-including-about-war-in-middle-east-/7857499.html	2024-11-08T12:53:22-08:00	
Crews in Southern California, New Jersey make progress against wildfires	Southern California firefighters made progress against a wildfire that has destroyed 132 structures, mostly homes. The fierce wind gusts that fanned the flames began easing Friday, allowing some people to return to sort through the charred remains of their homes. Maryanne Belote returned to her hillside neighborhood in Camarillo, a city northwest of Los Angeles, after making a harrowing escape with her cat, dog and horses as the blaze raged in the area. The only thing standing was a rock wall she built. 'If I hadn't gotten the horses, I would have been devastated, but I have my family and I have my animals so, I'm OK. I will rebuild,' she said, standing outside the remains of her home of 50 years. The Mountain Fire started Wednesday morning in Ventura County and had grown to about 83 square kilometers. It was 7% contained Friday morning. About 10,000 people remained under evacuation orders Friday morning as the fire continued to threaten about 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo in Ventura County. At least 88 structures were damaged in addition to the 132 destroyed. Officials did not specify whether they had fire, water or smoke damage. The cause of the fire has not been determined. Ten people suffered smoke inhalation or other non-life-threatening injuries, Ventura County Sheriff James Fryhoff said. Crews working in steep terrain with support from water-dropping helicopters were focusing on protecting homes on hillsides along the fire's northeast edge near the city of Santa Paula, home to more than 30,000 people, county fire officials said. Officials in several Southern California counties urged residents to watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees during the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds. Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore, moving in the opposite direction of the normal onshore flow that carries moist air from the Pacific. They typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and into early spring. Red flag warnings, indicating conditions for high fire danger, expired Friday morning when winds began diminishing. Governor Gavin Newsom has proclaimed a state of emergency in Ventura County. An air quality alert for harmful fine particle pollution was in effect from Friday morning until Saturday afternoon due to smoke from the wildfires. Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were stretched thin Friday with at least four wildfires burning in the state, stretching from the Pinelands in the central and western parts of the state to the New York City suburbs. The latest fire broke out along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York. It was smaller than the three others burning in New Jersey, each of which had burned less than a square mile as of late Thursday. Those fires, in Jackson, Glassboro and Evesham, were between 50% and 80% contained Friday. New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month, the weather service said, setting a record.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-in-southern-california-new-jersey-make-progress-against-wildfires-/7857490.html	2024-11-08T12:46:03-08:00	
US exposes Iranian-directed network plotting Trump assassination	Iranian operatives sought to assassinate now President-elect Doanld Trump just weeks before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and were willing to forego other plots against regime critics and high-profile targets to see it through, court documents say. The revelations, in documents unsealed Friday against the suspects in an unrelated murder-for-hire plot, stem from a series of conversations between the alleged ringleader, 51-year-old Farhad Shakeri, and the FBI. The documents indicate that Shakeri, who said he was in Tehran at the time of the conversations, agreed to speak with the FBI to gain a reduced prison sentence for an unnamed prisoner in the U.S. Shakeri told the agents that an official with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps approached him in mid- to late September, asking him to set aside a plot to kill an Iranian dissident and journalist in New York, to instead go after Trump. Shakeri said he was asked to provide a plan within seven days and that when he said targeting Trump would be costly, the IRGC official told him, 'We have already spent a lot of money … money's not an issue.' He also told the FBI that if a plan could not be formulated within the seven-day timeframe, the IRGC official planned to wait until after the U.S. election, reasoning Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him. The court documents do not say whether Shakeri’s conversations with the FBI were authorized by the IRGC or other authorities in Iran. The Iranian mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The plot against Trump is just the latest in what U.S. officials have described as brazen attempts by Tehran to kill the former and future U.S. president in retaliation for a 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC's Quds Force. In August, U.S. officials charged a Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, who had traveled to the United States months earlier on behalf of Iran looking for hitmen to kill Trump and others. 'There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Friday. 'We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,' he added. U.S. officials have been especially concerned about Iran's repeated use of criminal gangs and others to carry out its dirty work ((plotting)) on American soil. Court documents allege Shakeri, an Afghan national who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, fits the description. The documents say Shakeri was deported from the U.S. in 2008, after spending 14 years in prison for robbery. But they add that during his time behind bars, Shakeri cultivated a network of criminal associates that he then would use in efforts to carry out Iran's orders. According to prosecutors, one of those associates was working with Shakeri up until the U.S. election to kill VOA Persian Service journalist Masih Alinejad, described in the court documents as 'an Iranian American journalist, author, and political activist, and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime's human rights abuses and corruption.' The associate, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, then turned to one of his acquaintances, 36-year-old Jonathan Loadholt, to carry out the attack for a sum of $100,000. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested Thursday. Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy. The charges carry maximum prison sentences of 10 to 20 years. Shakeri is also charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Alinejad on Friday expressed astonishment that she was wrapped up in the plot to kill the president-elect. 'I am shocked,' she wrote on the X social media platform. '[T]he person assigned to assassinate @realDonaldTrump was also assigned to kill me on U.S. soil.' 'I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech — I don't want to die,' she said. 'Thank you to law enforcement for protecting me.' Last month, U.S. prosecutors charged a senior IRGC official in connection with a failed assassination attempt against Alinejad in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-exposes-iranian-directed-network-plotting-trump-assassination-/7857477.html	2024-11-08T12:33:55-08:00	
US law enforcement investigates racist texts targeting Black Americans	WASHINGTON — Federal and state authorities are investigating racist text messages sent anonymously to Black Americans across the country this week telling them they should be enslaved, prompting widespread condemnations as well as warnings. The NAACP civil rights group said the messages urged recipients in multiple states, including Alabama, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia, to report to a plantation to pick cotton, an offensive reference to past enslavement of Black people in the United States. It remained unclear what individuals or entities were behind the reported texts or how many people received them. People in at least 21 states, including high school and college students, received the texts, CNN and The Associated Press reported. 'These actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized,' NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement from the civil rights organization, which advocates for racial justice and rights for Black Americans. 'These messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country,' he said. Many in Black American communities say they anticipate a rollback of civil rights after Republican Donald Trump, who won Tuesday's presidential election over Democrat Kamala Harris, takes office on January 20. Trump pledged during his campaign to end federal diversity and inclusion programs. 'President Trump’s campaign has absolutely nothing to do with these text messages,' his spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement on Friday. An exit poll conducted by Edison Research on Election Day showed Harris winning 85% of the Black vote nationwide while Trump won 13%, up 1 percentage point from an exit poll in 2020 when he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden. 'We strongly condemn these hateful messages and anyone targeting Americans based on their ethnicity or background,' Robyn Patterson, a White House spokesperson for Biden, said in a statement on Friday confirming the investigations. 'Racism has no place in our country. Period.' The Federal Communications Commission said on Friday its enforcement bureau is among those probing the incidents. TextNow said one or more accounts on its messaging service sent offending messages and were shut down within an hour, adding that the texts were sent across multiple carriers nationwide in what it called 'an attack,' vowing to work with law enforcement. Local authorities are also investigating, with some state attorneys general urging recipients to report the messages to their civil rights divisions. Some school districts issued warnings and urged students and parents to report any such texts received to school staff or local authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-law-enforcement-investigates-racist-texts-targeting-black-americans/7857466.html	2024-11-08T12:31:44-08:00	
China backs Myanmar military amid growing border tensions	WASHINGTON — As clashes escalate along Myanmar’s northern border, Chinese Premier Li Qiang this week reaffirmed Beijing's support for Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The comment came Wednesday following a sideline meeting with the embattled junta leader at the November 6-7 Greater Mekong Subregion Summit in Kunming, in China’s southern Yunan province, according to a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry statement issued the same day. During the meeting, Li pledged China’s commitment to regional stability, stressing the importance of trade and border security, even as key crossings remain closed because of heightened conflict. He assured Myanmar of China’s support for 'a development path suited to its national conditions,' promising 'ongoing cooperation to advance Myanmar’s political reconciliation and transformation,' according to the statement. The statement went on to say that Li had 'underscored China’s commitment to the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor under the Belt and Road Initiative,' viewing it as a key project for both nations. The so-called CMEC links the Chinese province of Yunnan with economic hubs in Myanmar and give China access to the India Ocean through a series of infrastructure projects. In the meeting, Li 'expressed his hope that Myanmar would ensure the security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects' within its borders, while calling for greater cooperation in combating cross-border problems such as online gambling and telecom fraud. Min Aung Hlaing, in turn, expressed gratitude, the Foreign Ministry stated, for China’s assistance in development, pledging to 'protect Chinese investments within Myanmar' as both countries approach the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations. Opposition criticizes visit to China Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government has expressed concern over Min Aung Hlaing’s visit to China, describing it as an attempt by the military regime to gain legitimacy and financial support. Speaking to VOA by phone on Wednesday, Kyaw Zaw, spokesperson for the NUG President’s Office, described the visit as 'an effort to secure recognition and economic support for a regime that lacks legitimacy.' He further stated that Min Aung Hlaing has 'hindered Myanmar’s progress and stability,' attributing recent economic struggles to the junta’s actions. The NUG called on China to reconsider its engagement with the junta, with Kyaw Zaw saying that 'backing this regime could pose risks to regional stability and negatively impact civilians who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods.' China’s strategic calculations Myanmar analyst and former Communist Party of Burma member Than Soe Naing discussed China’s relationship with Myanmar’s junta by phone with VOA on Wednesday. 'China never directly blamed Min Aung Hlaing for the coup,' he said, although Beijing saw the arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar’s ousted civilian government, and the dissolution of her National League for Democracy party as missteps. 'Min Aung Hlaing has mishandled the military, politics and economy,' prompting China to explore alternatives. In June, China invited the leader of an earlier Myanmar military government, General Thein Sein, to an event with Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, sparking speculation that China might see Thein Sein as the leader of a future transitional government. Regional analysts described the invitation as a strategic signal. Thein Sein presided over earlier reforms and peacefully handed over power to Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, or NLD, after a 2015 election. He is seen as a figure who might be trusted to lead a potential transitional government if Myanmar moves toward reconciliation. However, Min Aung Hlaing’s invitation to the Mekong Summit signals China’s current backing, given his influence and control of the military, Than Soe Naing said. 'China acknowledges Min Aung Hlaing’s support within the military,' he said, 'while Aung San Suu Kyi lacks armed backing. Inviting him to Yunnan, not Beijing, allows China to show international goodwill from a neutral location.' While Aung San Suu Kyi is currently in jail and lacks the formal support of the military, revolutionary forces who are aligned with the NUG support her. Support for infrastructure Intense battles in northern Shan state involving the Three Brotherhood Alliance — a coalition of ethnic armed groups made up of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army — are now spreading toward central Myanmar, revealing Min Aung Hlaing’s weakened control, he said. 'China sees an opportunity to influence the military by supporting it,' Than Soe Naing said, 'believing this strengthens its strategic ally.' He also noted China’s economic interests, including the Myitsone dam project in Kachin State, suspended in 2010. 'If talks succeed, Min Aung Hlaing may be invited to Beijing,' linking China’s support for the junta to advancing key infrastructure projects. The Three Brotherhood Alliance has been the strongest force against the junta. Last year, these groups launched Operation 1027, a coordinated offensive aimed at junta forces in northern Myanmar, which borders China, on October 27. China has increasingly assumed the role of mediator, facilitating a series of cease-fire meetings between the junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance in Kunming — a move underscoring Beijing’s vested interest in regional stability and the security of its cross-border trade routes. However, these efforts have so far been unsuccessful and fighting in the region has escalated. China’s border trade restrictions China, long critical of Western sanctions, has imposed restrictions along the border, cutting off vital supplies such as food and medicine. Analysts believe the move aims to pressure the armed resistance groups while securing China’s regional interests. Border crossings into northern Shan and Kachin states — areas heavily influenced by opposition ethnic groups — have been closed, stalling trade. While Beijing has not publicly explained the closures, Chinese media have cited security concerns around key infrastructure, including the China-Myanmar oil pipeline. Observers see this as a calculated Chinese effort to weaken resistance forces and strengthen the Myanmar junta. Ta’ang National Liberation Army spokesperson Lway Yay Oo confirmed to VOA by phone that China’s trade restrictions have cut supplies to the TNLA and other allied ethnic armed groups. 'Border trade is still banned,' she said, adding that 'only food and clothing' have been allowed into Myanmar since October 25. Restrictions now also block goods from reaching areas controlled by the United Wa State Army, another armed ethnic group, and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, leading to shortages, particularly of medicine. When asked about China’s motive, she stated, 'China is pressuring us to halt military operations.' To support affected areas, she said, 'We’re providing tax exemptions on food, fuel and construction materials.' Although fighting has paused, Lway Yay Oo refused to say whether this is due to China’s pressure. 'Airstrikes by the junta are still ongoing,' she said, adding that China has not responded to calls for humanitarian aid. Analyst Than Soe Naing said China wants the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance 'to pull back and allow junta forces to reestablish control.' Kyaw Zaw, spokesperson for the NUG President Office, said 'Myanmar’s instability stems from the military’s violent actions that disrupt economic growth,' warning that restrictive border policies could significantly affect civilians dependent on cross-border trade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backs-myanmar-military-amid-growing-border-tensions/7857417.html	2024-11-08T11:50:57-08:00	
Chad says airstrikes kill scores of Boko Haram fighters	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian military airstrikes killed scores of Boko Haram fighters and injured several dozen more in the Lake Chad Basin, President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Friday. Chad planned the operation against the Islamist militant group after Boko Haram fighters killed 40 Chadian soldiers in an attack on a military garrison last month. About 700 Chadian soldiers celebrated as air force fliers returned to Kaiga Kindira, an island in the Lake Chad Basin near the border with Nigeria. Top military officials and Deby were there to greet them. Deby said he was happy because Haskinite, an operation he launched to search for and eliminate Boko Haram members hiding in the Lake Chad Basin, had begun successfully with the strikes carried out Thursday night into Friday. Military officials said the air attacks targeted five Boko Haram hideouts but did not identify locations. Deby said he also has ordered close to 1,000 infantry and navy troops to eliminate Boko Haram fighters and protect civilians, who are constantly harassed, raped, maimed and killed by militants in the Lake Chad area. Military officials said soldiers have seized many weapons and destroyed boats used by Boko Haram fighters to attack civilians and government troops. Deby said the attacks on Boko Haram will continue until the group is eradicated. Deby, who spoke on state TV, has been in areas of the Lake Chad Basin — shared by Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger and Chad — since October 28, when Boko Haram fighters attacked a military garrison, killing 40 soldiers and injuring scores of others, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria. Chad's government called on its citizens to support the ongoing operation by reporting strangers to soldiers, government officials and traditional rulers. Passale Kanabe Marcellin, Chad's water and sanitation minister, told officials at the Lake Chad Basin Commission meeting in N’djamena on Friday he is happy villagers who live in fear of Boko Haram are assisting government troops by contributing food, water, first aid equipment and money. He said Deby wants all countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to assist Chadian troops fighting Boko Haram by allowing soldiers to cross into Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger in pursuit of the militants. Boko Haram launched an insurgency against the Nigerian government in 2009. Fighting spread into Cameroon, Chad and Niger, where the militants established bases and hideouts. The United Nations says the fighting has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced over 3 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-says-airstrikes-kill-scores-of-boko-haram-fighters/7857361.html	2024-11-08T11:32:08-08:00	
Israel rejects UN atrocity accusations in Gaza	Geneva — A report by the United Nations human rights office, which accuses Israel Defense Forces of committing grave violations of international law in Gaza, many of which could amount to war crimes, has been met with a rebuke from Israel. 'The State of Israel categorically rejects the recent update report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation in the Gaza Strip,' said a statement issued by the Israeli mission in Geneva on Friday. 'OHCHR fails to accurately reflect the realities on the ground, and disregards the extensive role of Hamas and other terrorist organizations in deliberately causing civilian harm in Gaza,' it says. The U.N. report details 'the horrific reality' that has unfolded for the people of Israel and Gaza from November 2023 to April 2024, following the brutal attack on Oct. 7, 2023, by Hamas militants in Israel, who killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. 'I have repeatedly warned about the risk of atrocity crimes being committed,' Volker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement to coincide with the publication of the report Friday. 'The rules of war, in force now for 160 years, were designed to limit and prevent human suffering in times of armed conflict,' it said. 'It seems inconceivable that the parties to the conflict refuse to apply universally accepted and binding norms developed to preserve the very bare minimum of humanity.' While the report examines and documents breaches of international law committed by both parties to the conflict, it focuses largely on the many violations resulting from the punishing attacks inflicted by Israeli forces upon the Palestinian people and on the widescale destruction of civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. According to the report, 'Civilians, including children, women and men, have borne the brunt of the attacks, through the complete siege, and the various forms of continuing closure and blockade by the IDF of Gaza.' It accuses the Israeli government of failing to ensure, and even blocking, entry of humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave, of destroying civilian infrastructure, and of repeated mass displacement of the population. The report says that has led to 'unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness, disease, displacement, detention and destruction.' It finds Palestinian armed groups also have conducted hostilities in ways that have harmed civilians, noting the abuse of remaining Israeli hostages and projectiles that are indiscriminately fired into Israel. 'In many instances, the violations documented in this report by the parties could amount to war crimes,' it says. 'If committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population, further to a state or organizational policy, they may constitute crimes against humanity.' The report expresses concern about the forcible transfer of Palestinians, attacks on so-called safe zones as well as on hospitals 'in apparent systematic fashion.' It condemns the killings of medical staff, humanitarian workers, civil police and journalists and the reported use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas. 'Our monitoring indicates that this unprecedented level of killing and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law — namely the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack,' said Türk. 'Tragically these documented patterns of violations continue unabated, over one year after the start of the war.' Speaking on a video link in Amman, Jordan, Ajith Sunghay, the head of the U.N. human rights office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told journalists in Geneva that his office continues to monitor 'with grave concern' the situation in Gaza. 'Israel's conduct of hostilities has destroyed Gaza civilian infrastructure, its homes, hospitals and schools, its electricity, water and sewage systems,' he said. 'Within this dystopia of destruction and devastation, those alive are left injured, displaced and starving. 'We have been verifying the personal details of those killed in Gaza by strikes, shelling and other conduct of hostilities,' he added. 'Of those fatalities, we have so far found close to 70% to be children and women, indicating a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality.' Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Because of a lack of access to the enclave, Sunghay said his sources in Gaza have been able to verify only about 10,000 fatalities, including 4,700 children. He said that the figures provided by the Ministry of Health have matched those of the OHCHR and 'there was no reason to believe that it is any different now.' He explained that verifying 10,000 casualties with details on how they had perished 'was already a remarkable achievement under the current dire circumstances.' The Israeli mission did not find this explanation persuasive. 'By relying on unverified information, often promoted by Hamas or other entities known for manipulating narratives, the report severely compromises its objectivity and credibility and is indicative of the politically driven nature of this initiative.' Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, accused the OHCHR of hand-picking facts, of advancing a distorted narrative of a tragic conflict, and of 'shielding a ruthless terrorist adversary that actively seeks to maximize civilian harm.' Israel has frequently accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields by placing military installations in hospitals, schools and densely populated areas. 'The outcome is emboldening Palestinian terrorism, and violence against Israelis and Jews around the world,' Meron said. U.N. human rights chief Türk said justice must be served for the grave violations of international law that have been committed in Israel and Gaza. 'It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved,' he said. 'The violence must stop immediately; the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released, and we must focus on flooding Gaza with humanitarian aid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-rejects-un-atrocity-accusations-in-gaza/7857377.html	2024-11-08T11:24:28-08:00	
Israel to open new Gaza humanitarian aid crossing	Israel says it is opening a new humanitarian aid crossing into the Gaza Strip amid mounting U.S. pressure to get more assistance to Palestinians struggling with shortages of food and shelter since the Israel-Hamas war began. In a joint statement Friday, the Israel Defense Forces and COGAT, the agency coordinating Israeli government activities in occupied territories, said they are preparing to open the Kissufim crossing. The statement, released on social media account X, said the IDF and COGAT were acting 'in accordance with the directive from the political echelon and as part of the effort to increase the volume and routes of aid to Gaza.' The statement said the IDF had built inspection facilities and protective infrastructure at the Kissufim crossing, and paved roads both in Israeli territory and within Gaza to allow the transfer of aid to the southern part of Gaza. Kissufim is a small border crossing into southern Gaza near Kibbutz Kissufim, one of the sites attacked by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023, terror assault on Israel that sparked the war. Hamas and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The crossing has mostly been unused except by the military since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The opening comes as a deadline set by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin draws near. In a letter delivered Oct. 13, Austin and Blinken gave the Israelis 30 days to boost its humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza or face the possibility of cuts in U.S. military aid. The letter called for Israel to enable a minimum of 350 trucks a day to enter Gaza through four crossings and to open a fifth humanitarian entry point. During a U.S. State Department briefing Thursday, spokesman Mathew Miller mentioned the new crossing as he listed efforts Israel has taken to meet the demands made in the letter. Miller said that included efforts to stop looting from humanitarian trucks and an expansion of the Mawasi humanitarian area within Gaza. Miller said U.S. officials have seen as many as 229 humanitarian trucks enter Gaza two days ago, which he described as an improvement. As the Biden administration has just over two months left, it is unclear what will happen with the Biden-Austin demands, and Miller said he would not speculate on that. He did say that the U.S. has made clear 'there are potential legal and policy considerations' if Israel fails to improve humanitarian assistance to Gaza and implement steps outlined in the letter. Miller said there have been active discussions with Israel as recently as the past several days, and an assessment will be made at the end of the 30-day period laid out in the letter. At a briefing Friday at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.N. spokeswoman Stephanie Tremblay, citing a new report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said the situation in Gaza is extremely grave and rapidly deteriorating. The report said there is a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip. Tremblay said, 'immediate action — within days not weeks — is required from all actors who are directly taking part in the conflict, or have influence on its conduct, to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation.' Tremblay also updated the situation in the West Bank, citing a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, which said multiple Israeli military operations in the north this week included airstrikes and other lethal war-like tactics, which appear to exceed law enforcement standards. The spokeswoman said initial information indicated eight Palestinians were killed and four others injured during Tuesday’s operations in Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm. OCHA reports that between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4, Israel settlers carried out 35 attacks against Palestinians that caused casualties or property damage, including to olive trees that were vandalized. Since the beginning of October, OCHA has documented 177 settler incidents directly related to the olive harvest in 73 communities across the West Bank, most of which caused casualties or property damage. Also Friday, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, issued a statement saying the IDF used two excavators and a bulldozer to destroy part of a fence and a concrete structure at a UNIFIL position in Ras Naqoura. In a statement posted to its X account, UNIFIL said the IDF responded to their protest by denying any activity was taking place inside the UNIFIL position. The UNIFIL statement went on to say the 'deliberate and direct destruction of clearly identifiable UNIFIL property is a flagrant violation of international law and resolution 1701.' In its own statement Friday, the IDF said it discovered and dismantled what it said was a Hezbollah terrorist training center located 200 meters from an UNIFIL post. They said the compound was 'used by terrorists for training, studying, and storing large quantities of weapons.' On its website, the IDF released pictures and videos of weapons and other materials it said it confiscated from the location. It did not identify the location of what it called the Hezbollah training center or the adjacent UNIFIL post and it was unclear if it was near the Ras Naqoura position.

US military reports drone crash in Somalia	The U.S. military says it is investigating what caused an army drone to crash in southern Somalia this week. The military's Africa Command, known as AFRICOM, confirmed the incident in a post Friday on social media platform X. 'A U.S. Army operated MQ-1C crashed in southern Somalia at approximately 12:40 PM local on Nov. 5,' AFRICOM said. 'An investigation is ongoing, although the crash does not appear to be the result of any attempt to shoot down the aircraft.' AFRICOM said it will release more information as it becomes available. AFRICOM did not disclose the exact location of the crash, but a Somali official said he was told a drone crashed in an area controlled by the al-Shabab militant group. Mohamed Ibrahim Barre, the governor of Lower Shabelle, told the VOA Horn of Africa Service that the drone crashed north of Farsoley village, in Lower Shabelle, about 85 kilometers west of Mogadishu. Barre said he did not know who the drone belongs to. The U.S. military has conducted surveillance and airstrikes against al-Shabab for years in support of successive Somali administrations. In addition, the U.S. also trains an elite Somali commando unit known as Danab, or lightning. Earlier this year, U.S. and Somalia have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the construction of up to five military bases for the Danab Brigade, in a project valued at over $100 million. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-reports-drone-crash-in-somalia-/7857327.html	2024-11-08T10:47:53-08:00	
Security analysts concerned as Nigeria warns of new terror group	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian security analysts are voicing concerns after defense officials on Thursday warned of a new insurgent group known as the Lakurawas, operating mainly in the country's northwestern region. Authorities said the group originated from the Sahel region, particularly Mali and Niger, after last July's coup in Niger disrupted joint military patrols along the Nigerian border. Nigerian defense officials announced the discovery to journalists in Abuja on Thursday and called for heightened vigilance. Major General Edward Buba, the defense spokesperson, did not provide details on whether the group had carried out any major attack, but local media report the group has been collecting cows from locals in exchange for 'protection.' The tactic is commonly used by extremist groups to exert control and finance their operations. Lakurawas infiltrated northwest Sokoto and Kebbi states from neighboring Niger and Mali following last year's coup, which severed ties between Nigeria and Niger and disrupted joint regional security patrols. Buba said security forces are tracking the group's activities. 'It is, indeed, the first attempt of the Sahelian jihadists to have a foothold in our country. They were kept at bay all this while, when we had joint cross-border operations with the Republic of Niger. They took advantage of the breakdown in cooperation between both countries, which has now been restored. We know exactly where they are,' Buba said. The ideology of the new group is not yet known. However, its emergence signals a growing threat in northwest Nigeria, already challenged by attacks by armed gangs and kidnappings for ransom. Nigeria has been struggling with prolonged insurgency by Boko Haram — a group opposed to western education in northern Nigeria. In October, Nigeria’s military said it killed some 160 insurgents, arrested more than 80 and freed scores of captives. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said he is worried but not surprised by news of the new group, given that regional bloc ECOWAS, chaired by Nigeria's president, sanctioned Niger after the coup last year. 'We saw this coming when the Niger coup happened, especially withdrawal from ECOWAS membership,' Iroegbu said. 'Severing ties with ECOWAS does not mean that we should not have bilateral agreements intact. Even if we sever the relationship in other [levels] ... maybe at the diplomatic level, but at the security or intelligence level [it] should not be something that we should play with.' Iroegbu said the group’s emergence is going to have a negative impact on Nigeria's security. 'We should not downplay the significance of this thing. It's going to drain the scarce resources we have already. All the security, bilateral agreement, intelligence corporation, security corporation should be strengthened even more,' Iroegbu said. In August, Nigeria's chief of defense staff visited Niger in a bid to strengthen military ties and regional security. Buba said authorities and security forces are working to address the issue and protect citizens from the Lakurawas group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/security-analysts-concerned-as-nigeria-warns-of-new-terror-group/7857317.html	2024-11-08T10:46:25-08:00	
China's forays in disputed sea ups tensions as Indonesian leader visits Beijing	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is in Beijing Friday for his first official visit to China, where he is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang. Experts say he hopes to maintain the personal rapport with the Chinese leaders established by his predecessor, Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo. 'Presumably, he will be leaning more toward Beijing for economic purposes since Prabowo has ambitious plans for achieving 8% economic growth,' Aristyo Darmawan, a lecturer in international law at Universitas Indonesia, told VOA. However, Darmawan voiced concern about reports that Prabowo has proposed to collaborate with China on oil exploration in the North Natuna Sea, a portion of the South China Sea that has long been controlled by Indonesia and lies within its Exclusive Economic Zone but is claimed by China. 'I think this is unnecessary and actually dangerous for Indonesia,' he said. 'I think Prabowo is keen to have a closer relationship with Beijing, and, therefore, it might indicate how he might respond to any incursion in the North Natuna Sea.' In his inaugural speech to Parliament on October 20, Prabowo vowed to bolster the defense of Indonesian territory. The next day, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency drove a Chinese coast guard ship away from a contested area in the North Natuna Sea. The same ship returned on October 24 and 25, disrupting a survey being conducted by Indonesia’s state-owned oil company, Pertamina. The three intrusions, coming within a week during Prabowo’s first days in office, prompting questions about Beijing’s motives. Past territorial disputes Confrontations have dated back for years in the region, which is believed to hold huge, unexploited oil and gas deposits. These prompted then-President Widodo to hold a Cabinet meeting aboard a warship off the Natuna islands in 2016 to assert Indonesia’s sovereignty. In December 2020, Widodo again visited the Natuna islands amid a stand-off between Indonesian warships and Chinese coast guard vessels escorting 60 fishing boats. Afterward, Indonesia deployed fighter jets and warships to patrol the waters, and it sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese ambassador to Indonesia. One year later, China demanded that Indonesia stop drilling for oil and natural gas in the sea. A letter from Chinese diplomats to Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry claimed that a temporary offshore rig operated by Indonesia was in Chinese territory. In 2023, a Chinese coast guard ship escorted a Chinese research ship without permission into North Natuna waters to carry out exploration activities. Better monitoring Ario Seno, a researcher at the Indonesian Maritime Security agency, said Indonesia does not have enough manpower and patrol boats to monitor the vast area effectively. This makes it hard to catch trespassing fishing boats or coast guard ships in a timely manner. To address the problem, the agency is developing a monitoring system using buoys equipped with radar, long-distance surveillance cameras and sonar, which will be connected to its satellite system and the agency’s base. 'Our patrol boats will be able to focus on enforcing the law, so we don't have to often patrol around in circles and then find nothing. With the existence of these floating surveillance tools, violations can be immediately detected, and the available patrol boats can immediately take action,' Ario said. Indonesian authorities say the proposed system could be ready by 2026 and will provide major savings in surveillance costs. China’s lukewarm response During an October 24 press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian defended China’s behavior in North Natuna, insisting the waters belonged to his country even though Beijing’s expansive claims to the South China Sea have been rejected by an international tribunal. 'China’s coast guard vessel carries out routine patrols in waters under the jurisdiction of China in accordance with international law and China’s domestic laws,' Lin said. 'China stands ready to enhance communication and consultation with Indonesia through diplomatic channels and properly handle maritime issues between the two countries.' A week later, Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah 'Roy' Soemirat, said Indonesia’s position on the contested waters 'remains unchanged.' 'We continue to have dialogue behind the scenes and other diplomatic efforts to address this issue proportionally with other countries,' he said, adding that Indonesia was in the process of seeking confirmation and exchanging 'the most factual' information with the related parties. Aristyo, the Universitas Indonesia lecturer, said Indonesia should be careful in its talks with China to ensure that Indonesia is treating the issue seriously. He said that in the past, Prabowo has sent mixed signals regarding the territorial dispute. It’s too early to judge how he will respond as president, but there are expectations he will defend Indonesia’s sovereign waters more forcefully.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-forays-in-disputed-sea-ups-tensions-as-indonesian-leader-visits-beijing/7857240.html	2024-11-08T10:10:44-08:00	
Trump’s victory: Ukraine braces for policy shifts amid war	With former President Donald Trump returning to the White House, Ukrainians are bracing for potential shifts in U.S. policy that could reshape its fight for survival against Russian aggression. Trump’s agenda could take a sharp turn from the Biden administration's unwavering support, raising fears that vital U.S. aid might be at risk. Myroslava Gongadze reports from Europe. Camera: Vladyslav Smilianets	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-victory-ukraine-braces-for-policy-shifts-amid-war-/7857027.html	2024-11-08T07:15:09-08:00	
India optimistic about Trump presidency, worried about trade, tariffs	NEW DELHI — As India looks ahead to President-elect Donald Trump taking charge in Washington, there is optimism the strategic relationship built by the two countries in recent years will strengthen. India also hopes to benefit if Trump takes a less confrontational approach to Russia, say analysts. New Delhi also is bracing for turbulence in trade ties, though, which could be affected by Trump’s 'America first' agenda. In his congratulatory message posted on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Trump 'my friend' and said, 'I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-U.S. Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.' Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging and Trump’s visit to India during his first term in 2020 — a time when Trump shared warm relations with Modi. Analysts in New Delhi expect that India will remain a key partner for Washington. 'Compared to most other countries, particularly some of the USA’s closest partners, perhaps India is better placed because of its centrality in the Indo-Pacific and the role it plays in counterbalancing China,' said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'Given that Trump had invested in this partnership in his earlier term, there is hope it will continue the same trajectory,' he said. The Quad group — a partnership among the United States, Japan, Australia and India, which had been dormant earlier — was revived under the previous Trump administration with an eye on China. However, a sense of uncertainty lingers in the corridors of power in New Delhi. 'The relationship may face hiccups, which we cannot anticipate at the moment given Trump’s leadership style and unpredictability,' said Pant. India also hopes that confrontation between the U.S. and Russia will lessen under the Trump administration. During the campaign, Trump had said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war without elaborating. In the past he has spoken of having a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'If U.S. hostility to Russia lessens under Trump, we believe that it would reduce the extreme and overwhelming Russian dependence on China, which is good from India’s perspective,' according to Sreeram Chaulia, dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs at O.P. Jindal Global University. Despite a recent thaw in ties with China, India remains wary of Beijing. Others point out that maintaining India’s time-tested ties with Russia could become easier under a Trump presidency. India refused to join Western sanctions against Russia or condemn the war in Ukraine, positions that became an irritant in Washington. 'Trump appears to have a less strident approach to Russia, and that will help India by making it simpler to balance relations between Washington and Russia,' said Anand Kumar, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi. 'Tariff king' While security ties will likely stay on track, there are worries over whether trade relations will take a hit under Trump, who has said he will follow an 'America first' agenda and impose tariffs on countries that have trade surpluses with Washington. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner — two-way trade last year totaled almost $120 billion, with a surplus of $30 billion in India’s favor. During his previous term, Trump called India a 'tariff king,' criticized high duties that New Delhi imposed on American products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and terminated India’s designation as a developing nation that had allowed businesses to export hundreds of products duty-free to the United States. India retaliated by raising duties on some American products. Such tensions could be exacerbated because Trump is likely to push New Delhi to lower import duties for American companies. 'This will be a slippery slope for India; he could demand market concessions,' said Chaulia. Indian officials, however, have sounded an optimistic note. 'There was already a reordering of the supply chains taking place. It is very likely that in view of the [U.S.] election results, this would accelerate. Some of it will be disruptive, but we in India see it as an opportunity,' Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar Subrahmanyan told business leaders in Australia on Thursday. He was referring to the trend of companies such as Apple setting up manufacturing bases in India as they looked to diversify production from China. But analysts say Trump could take a diametrically different approach. 'He has this philosophy of onshoring, that is bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. rather than friendshoring which Biden used to talk about — that is encouraging businesses to move to friendly countries. So, the overall idea that U.S. businesses that are leaving China would think of India as an alternative — that model Trump may not encourage,' said Chaulia. Defense and technology There also are questions about how the defense and technology cooperation between India and the U.S. that gained momentum under the Biden administration will move forward. India has pushed for co-production of defense technology rather than relying solely on direct purchases of military equipment; sustaining that under Trump may pose a challenge, according to analysts. 'The U.S. has operated under the assumption that boosting India’s capabilities is in America’s self-interest, especially in balancing China. But Trump is likely to demand some Indian ‘pro’ for American ‘quid,’' analyst C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper on Thursday. 'India may find itself on a steep learning curve as it figures out there may be no ‘free lunch’ under Trump’s second term,' Mohan wrote. Still, as India prepares to navigate a Trump presidency, there is an overall sense of confidence. 'I don’t think India is as worried as some other world capitals. New Delhi understands that if Trump’s obsession with China continues, that gives India greater space to maneuver,' said Pant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-optimistic-about-trump-presidency-worried-about-trade-tariffs/7856987.html	2024-11-08T06:54:43-08:00	
China approves $840B plan to refinance local government debt, boost slowing economy	BEIJING — China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy. The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday. Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly. Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028. Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments. Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a 'fundamental shift' in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China's government debt risk was 'controllable.' Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic. Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged. The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending. The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years. For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery. In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy. Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-approves-840b-plan-to-refinance-local-government-debt-boost-slowing-economy-/7856983.html	2024-11-08T06:39:28-08:00	
Ready or not? How China scrambled to counter the second Trump shock	BEIJING/HONG KONG — After Donald Trump first stormed the White House eight years ago, rattled Chinese leaders responded to his tariffs and fiery rhetoric with force, resulting in a trade war that plunged ties between the globe's largest economies to multiyear lows. This time around, Beijing has been preparing for Trump's return by deepening ties with allies, boosting self-reliance in tech, and setting aside money to prop up the economy that is now more vulnerable to fresh tariffs already threatened by Trump. While some retaliation to those moves might be unavoidable, China will focus on exploiting rifts between the U.S. and its allies, experts say, and aim to lower the temperature to help strike an early deal to cushion the blow from trade friction. Zhao Minghao, international relations expert at Shanghai's Fudan University said China probably wouldn't replay the playbook from the first Trump presidency when Beijing had a very strong reaction to Trump's moves on tariffs. He pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping's message to Trump from Thursday, in which Xi called for 'cooperation' and not 'confrontation,' emphasizing 'stable, sound and sustainable' relations between the two superpowers. 'Trump is not a stranger to Beijing at this time,' Zhao told Reuters. 'Beijing would respond in a measured way and make efforts to communicate with the Trump team.' While Chinese tech giants are now far less reliant on U.S. imports, the economy — hit by a massive property crisis and saddled with unsustainable debt — is in a weaker position than in 2016, struggling to eke out 5% growth compared to 6.7% then. To make things worse, Trump has pledged to end China's most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. Fudan's Zhao said Beijing has this scenario gamed out but expects tariffs to come in below the level pledged on the campaign trail because 'that would significantly push up the inflation in the U.S.' Still, that threat alone has unnerved producers in the world's largest exporter because China sells goods worth more than $400 billion a year to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in parts for products Americans buy elsewhere. Li Mingjiang, a scholar at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that as a result, the Chinese economy might require even more stimulus than the $1.4 trillion expected on Friday. 'It'll be a very serious blow to China's international trade that will affect jobs and government revenues,' said Li. 'China will probably have to come up with a much bigger stimulus package domestically.' Charm offensive To boost global trade, China has been on a diplomatic blitz, shoring up alliances, mending fences with foes, and continuing difficult talks with the European Union, even after the bloc imposed stiff tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Last month China ended a four-year military stand-off with India on their disputed border; in August, it resolved a two-year spat with Japan over the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant; and Premier Li Qiang in June visited Australia — the first such trip in seven years. Also last month, both Xi and Li attended separate summits of BRICS — which now accounts for 35% of the global economy — and the 10-state Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as China deepens ties with the Global South. 'The first Trump administration did not show a lot of interest in robust engagement in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, which provided the Chinese a lot of latitude to operate in these markets largely uncontested,' said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of the China-Global South Project. In Europe, trade tensions with China could be counterbalanced by worries over Trump's potentially reduced role in the Ukraine war and his economic policies, creating an opening for Beijing, say some experts. 'China will carry on reaching out to Europeans, the British, the Australians and even the Japanese, not only to try to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the countries of the north,' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert at Hong Kong's Baptist University. 'But also as part of its mission to rebalance its foreign trade in favor of the Global South,' he said. Tech punchline During the first trade war, Trump banned high-tech exports to China and sanctioned companies including China's largest chipmaker SMIC, prompting its tech sector to become domestic-focused and self-sufficient. Winston Ma, a former managing director for the China Investment Corporation (CIC), China's sovereign wealth fund, said a major trigger for this shift was Trump's ban on the sale of components to Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE in 2018. That was 'really scary from a China perspective, so they began to prepare. It was the start of that sort of defensive thinking,' added Ma. Soon after, Xi urged the nation to boost self-reliance in science and tech, pushing China to build-up crucial industries including AI and space. The result: Eight years ago, China had only four government procurement projects worth over $1.4 million, replacing foreign hardware and software with domestic alternatives. That number has exploded to 169 such projects this year, data show. Despite these strides, chipmakers 'definitely feel the tightening — these Chinese companies couldn't supply to global clients and can't have access to the latest chips,' said Ma. Nazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows his advisers, said she expected Trump to be 'much more aggressive about export control policies towards China.' She anticipated 'a significant expansion of the entity list,' that restricts exports to those on it to capture affiliates and business partners of listed companies. Ma, the ex-CIC executive, said the restrictions will have an impact for some time as the U.S. expands the sanctions regime to overseas suppliers. 'I think the punchline is that the coming years are the most critical for this U.S.-China tech rivalry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ready-or-not-how-china-scrambled-to-counter-the-second-trump-shock-/7856403.html	2024-11-08T03:41:24-08:00	
China summons Philippine ambassador over new maritime laws	BEIJING/MANILA, Philippines — China summoned the Philippines' ambassador on Friday to express its objection to two new laws in the Southeast Asian nation asserting maritime rights and sovereignty over disputed areas of the South China Sea, its foreign ministry said. China made 'solemn representations' to the ambassador shortly after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr signed the Maritime Zones Act and the Archipelagic Sea Lanes Act into law to strengthen his country's maritime claims and bolster its territorial integrity. The Maritime Zones law 'illegally includes most of China's Huangyan Island and Nansha Islands and related maritime areas in the Philippines' maritime zones,' Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said, using the Chinese names for Scarborough Shoal and the Spratly Islands respectively. Beijing has rejected a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration which said its expansive maritime claims over the South China Sea had no legal basis, in a case that was brought by Manila. The United States, a Philippine ally, backs the court's ruling. Marcos said the two laws he signed, which define maritime entitlements and set designated sea lanes and air routes, were a demonstration of commitment to uphold the international rules-based order, and protect Manila's rights to exploit resources peacefully in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). 'Our people, especially our fisher folk, should be able to pursue their livelihood free from uncertainty and harassment,' Marcos said. 'We must be able to harness mineral and energy resources in our sea bed.' But Beijing said the laws were a 'serious infringement' of its claims over the contested areas. 'China urges the Philippine side to effectively respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, to immediately stop taking any unilateral actions that may lead to the widening of the dispute and complicate the situation,' Mao said. China, which also has sovereignty disputes with the other countries in the region, has in the past enacted domestic laws covering the South China Sea, such as a coast guard law in 2021 that allows it to detain foreigners suspected of trespassing. Beijing, which uses an armada of coast guard ships to assert its claims, routinely accuses vessels of trespassing in areas of the South China Sea that fall inside the EEZs of its neighbors, and has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines in the past year. Philippine officials acknowledged the challenges they face in implementing the new laws, with one author, Senator Francis Tolentino, saying he did not expect a reduction in tensions. 'China will not recognize these, but the imprimatur that we'll be getting from the international community would strengthen our position,' Tolentino told a press conference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-summons-philippine-ambassador-over-new-maritime-laws/7856351.html	2024-11-08T01:57:20-08:00	
Nearly 70% of Gaza war dead women and children, UN rights office says	GENEVA — The U.N. Human Rights Office said on Friday nearly 70% of the fatalities it has verified in the Gaza war were women and children, and condemned what it called a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. The U.N. count covers the first seven months of the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip that began more than a year ago. The 8,119 victims verified by the U.N. Rights Office in that seven-month period is considerably lower than the toll of over 43,000 provided by Palestinian health authorities for the full 13 months of conflict. But the U.N. breakdown of the victims' age and gender backs the Palestinian assertion that women and children represent a large portion of those killed in the war. This finding indicates 'a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, including distinction and proportionality,' the U.N. rights office said in a statement accompanying the 32-page report. 'It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies and that, in the meantime, all relevant information and evidence are collected and preserved,' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said. Israel did not immediately comment on the report's findings. Israel's military, which began its offensive in response to the October 7, 2023, attack in which Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, says it takes care to avoid harming civilians in Gaza. It has said approximately one civilian has been killed for every fighter, a ratio it blames on Hamas, saying the Palestinian militant group uses civilian facilities. Hamas has denied using civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as human shields. Youngest victim aged 1 day The youngest victim whose death was verified by U.N. monitors was a 1-day-old boy, and the oldest was a 97-year-old woman, the report said. Overall, children represented 44% of the victims, with children aged 5-9 representing the single biggest age category, followed by those aged 10-14, and then those aged up to and including 4. This broadly reflects the enclave's demographics, which the report said reflected an apparent failure to take precautions to avoid civilian losses. It showed that in 88% of cases, five or more people were killed in the same attack, pointing to the Israeli military's use of weapons with an effect across a wide area, although it said some fatalities may have been the result of errant projectiles from Palestinian armed groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-70-of-gaza-war-dead-women-and-children-un-rights-office-says/7856343.html	2024-11-08T01:30:53-08:00	
Overnight Russian attacks across Ukraine kill 1, officials say	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight, killing one civilian and wounding more than 30 people in the center, south, and northeast, Ukrainian officials said Friday. The Russian forces launched 92 drones and five missiles at 12 Ukrainian regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Sixty-two drones and four missiles were downed, it said, and 26 drones were 'lost,' most likely meaning they had been thwarted electronically. The Interior Ministry said one person had been killed in the Odesa region, where civilian infrastructure and homes were damaged and nine people were injured. Four people were wounded in a drone attack on the Kyiv region and at least six private houses and several cars were damaged, it said. Russia also pounded the city of Kharkiv in the northeast with guided bombs, wounding at least 25 people, said regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a fresh appeal to Kyiv's partners to help strengthen its air defenses. 'Air defense, long-range capabilities, weapons packages, sanctions against the aggressor -- this is the answer that is needed, not only in words, but also in actions,' he said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia has intensified its air attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, sending swarms of drones almost every night. Ukrainian officials say Russia is trying to stretch Ukraine's air defenses and demoralize the civilian population as the war nears the 1,000-day mark and Moscow's troops advance in the east. Russia launched more than 2,000 attack drones at civilian and military targets in October, Ukraine's military said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/overnight-russian-attacks-across-ukraine-kill-1-officials-say/7856338.html	2024-11-08T01:15:54-08:00	
In Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after the election	RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights — Israeli residents of 'Trump Heights' are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights. During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel's control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him. But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or 'Ramat Trump' in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel's more-than-yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation. Trump's election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements. 'Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,' said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights' community manager. Ori Kallner, head of the Golan's regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments. 'President Trump's return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,' he said. Hanging on while war rages nearby Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes. An enormous sign with the settlement's name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition. Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the October 1 invasion of Lebanon. 'We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,' said Freimann. Trump Heights is only about 12 kilometers from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter. Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized. That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would 'fully recognize' Israel's control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel's settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation. Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there. According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation. Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel's economic center in Tel Aviv. That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 20 kilometers away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later. In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump's birthday and said: 'I can't think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.' As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how. Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy. 'Congratulations on history's greatest comeback!' the Israeli leader said in a statement. 'Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: 'The Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won't stop growing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-israeli-settlement-named-after-trump-residents-see-opportunity-after-the-election/7856308.html	2024-11-08T00:42:47-08:00	
Israel, Netherlands condemn 'antisemitic' attacks on football fans in Amsterdam	AMSTERDAM — Antisemitic rioters 'actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them' after a football match, Amsterdam authorities said Friday as Israel said it was sending planes to the Dutch capital to fly fans home. An unknown number of Israeli supporters were injured in the Thursday night violence that was condemned by the leaders of both the Netherlands and Israel as antisemitic. A statement issued by the Dutch capital's municipality, police and prosecution office said that the night after the Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv 'was very turbulent with several incidents of violence aimed at Maccabi supporters.' There was no immediate word on the number of injured or arrests. The violence erupted Thursday despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the football stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli football club. Israel ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the Israelis home. 'The prime minister has directed that two rescue planes be sent immediately to assist our citizens,' said a statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It added that 'the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked,' and that Netanyahu 'views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity.' He demanded that the Dutch government take 'vigorous and swift action' against those involved. Netanyahu's office added that he had called for increased security for the Jewish community in the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on X that he followed reports of the violence 'with horror.' 'Completely unacceptable anti-Semitic attacks on Israelis. I am in close contact with everyone involved,' he added, saying that he had spoken to Netanyahu and 'emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted. It is now quiet in the capital.' Geert Wilders, the hard right nationalist lawmaker whose Party for Freedom won elections in the Netherlands last year and who is a staunch ally of Israel, reacted to a video apparently showing a Maccabi fan being surrounded by several men. 'Looks like a Jew hunt in the streets of Amsterdam. Arrest and deport the multicultural scum that attacked Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters in our streets. Ashamed that this can happen in The Netherlands. Totally unacceptable,' Wilders said. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, also condemned the violence in a post on the social media platform X. Ajax won the Europa League match 5-0.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-netherlands-condemn-antisemitic-attacks-on-football-fans-in-amsterdam-/7856321.html	2024-11-08T00:41:53-08:00	
Typhoon floods villages, rips off roofs and damages airports in Philippines	MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon Yinxing battered the northern Philippines with floods and landslides before blowing away from the country on Friday, leaving two airports damaged and aggravating a calamity caused by back-to-back storms that hit in recent weeks. There were no immediate reports of casualties from Yinxing, the 13th major storm to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago this year. The typhoon, locally called Marce, was last tracked over the South China Sea about 100 kilometers west of the northern Philippine province of Ilocos Norte with sustained winds of up to 150 kph and gusts of up to 205 kph, according to government forecasters. It is expected to weaken further before hitting Vietnam. The typhoon flooded villages, toppled trees and electricity poles, and damaged houses and buildings in Cagayan province, where Yinxing made landfall Thursday afternoon, provincial officials said. More than 40,000 villagers were evacuated to safer ground in the province. In the northernmost island province of Batanes, Gov. Marilou Cayco said Yinxing's fierce winds and rain blew away roofs of houses and damaged seaports and two domestic airport terminals. More details of damage, including in two northern mountain towns hit by landslides, were expected after provinces battered by the typhoon complete an assessment, officials said. The new damage will complicate recovery efforts from two powerful storms that lashed the northern region in recent weeks. Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey left at least 151 people dead in the Philippines and affected nearly 9 million others, mostly in the northern and central provinces. More than 14 billion pesos ($241 million) in rice, corn and other crops and infrastructure were damaged. Trami dumped one to two months' worth of rain in just 24 hours in some regions. In the hardest-hit province of Batangas, south of Manila, at least 61 people died in floods and landslides. More than 630,000 people were still displaced due to Trami and Kong-rey as of Thursday, officials said, including 172,000 who remained in emergency shelters as Yinxing blew across the country's mountainous north. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. decided not to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru next week to focus on recovery efforts, Communications Secretary Cesar Chavez said. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines. The archipelago also lies in a region often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/typhoon-floods-villages-rips-off-roofs-and-damages-airports-in-philippines/7856320.html	2024-11-08T00:26:32-08:00	
At least 2 dead after a fishing boat sinks off South Korea's Jeju island	SEOUL, South Korea — A fishing boat capsized and sank off the coast of South Korea's Jeju island on Friday, leaving at least two people dead and 12 others unaccounted for, coast guard officials said. Nearby fishing vessels managed to pull 15 crew members out of the water, but two of them were later pronounced dead after being brought to shore. The other 13 did not sustain life-threatening injuries, said Kim Han-na, an official at Jeju's coast guard. She said 27 crew members -– 16 South Koreans and 11 Indonesians -– were on the 129-ton boat, which left Jeju's Seogwipo port late Thursday to catch mackerel. The coast guard received a distress signal at around 4:30 a.m. Friday from a nearby fishing vessel that conducted rescue efforts as the boat sank about 22 kilometers northwest of the island. The rescuers were slowed by strong winds and waves of about 2 meters. At least 30 vessels and 13 aircraft from South Korea's coast guard, police, fire service and military were deployed as of Friday morning to search for survivors. They were being assisted by 13 civilian vessels. Jung Moo-won, Jeju coast guard's director of security and safety, said rescue workers have confirmed the location of the sunken boat and have dispatched divers to search the vessel. The two crew members who died were South Koreans. Of the 13 survivors, nine were Indonesians, Jung said. Among the 12 missing, 10 were South Koreans. Jung said South Korean officials contacted the Indonesian Embassy to reach the families of the Indonesia crew members. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for officials to mobilize all available resources to find and rescue the missing crew members, his office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-2-dead-after-a-fishing-boat-sinks-off-south-korea-s-jeju-island/7856319.html	2024-11-08T00:16:53-08:00	
Hindu devotees flock to rivers for prayers to the sun god	NEW DELHI — Tens of thousands of Hindu devotees flocked to rivers and bodies of water across India to pray to the sun god as part of the Chhath festival this week. In Noida, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, families gathered at the Yamuna river, which is covered with white toxic foam as a result of pollutants discharged from nearby industries. Women in brightly colored saris waded into the knee-deep water flecked with blobs of white foam. Some carried a coconut or other fruits as an offering to thank Lord Surya, the god of the sun, for sustaining life on earth as they sought divine blessings. The Yamuna is considered one of India's most sacred rivers, and Hindu devotees have continued to use it despite warnings about the toxic foam. A court in Delhi on Wednesday forbade worshipers from performing rituals on the bank of the heavily polluted river over health and safety concerns, local media reported, yet thousands gathered on Thursday and Friday at the river banks to immerse themselves in the river and drinks it water. From the financial capital Mumbai to Hyderabad in the south and Guwahati in the east, thousands of men, women and children did the same. The Chhath festival, celebrated after the Hindu festival of Diwali, originated in the country's eastern states, with large celebrations in Bihar and Jharkand, and extends to Nepal. Over the years, it has grown more popular across India, often introduced as migrants from eastern states mark the festival away from home. The rituals, which stretch over four days, include a holy dip in the river and a period of fasting and abstaining from drinking water. On the last two days, devotees stand in the waters to pray to the sun as it rises and sets, with some families camping out overnight along the banks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hindu-devotees-flock-to-rivers-for-prayers-to-the-sun-god/7856317.html	2024-11-08T00:08:54-08:00	
Yemen's Houthi rebels shoot down what witnesses say was a US drone	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down what bystanders described as an American drone early Friday, potentially the latest downing of a U.S. spy drone as the militants continue their attacks on the Red Sea corridor. The U.S. military acknowledged the videos circulating online showing what appeared to be a flaming aircraft dropping out of the sky and a field of burning debris in what those off-camera described as an area of Yemen's al-Jawf province. The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further. It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video. The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles capable of downing aircraft such as the Iranian missile known as the 358. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo. The Houthis have been a key component of Iran's self-described 'Axis of Resistance' during the Mideast wars that includes Lebanon's Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups. The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for downing the aircraft. However, it can take their fighters hours or even days after an incident before they acknowledge it. Since Houthis seized the country’s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the rebels have shot down MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military has declined to offer a total figure for the number of drones it has lost during that time. Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 15,240 meters and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months. In October, the U.S. military unleashed B-2 stealth bombers to target underground bunkers used by the Houthis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/yemen-s-houthi-rebels-shoot-down-what-witnesses-say-was-a-us-drone/7856288.html	2024-11-07T22:14:58-08:00	
Argentine prosecutors charge 3 linked to death of former One Direction star Liam Payne	BUENOS AIRES — Three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday. Prosecutor Andrés Madrea charged the three suspects, whose identities were not revealed, with the crimes of 'abandonment of a person followed by death' and 'supplying and facilitating the use of narcotics,' the prosecutor's office said. Madrea also requested their arrest to judge Laura Bruniard, who ruled the three cannot leave the country. Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo, in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding. Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had 'traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant' in the moments before his death. Investigators said hours after Payne's death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between October 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer. The charges in Payne's case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of Friends star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor's personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic. Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018. Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cellphone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer's personal computer – which is damaged – and other devices that were seized. Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious. Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne dying by suicide. One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne — like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson — pursued a solo career. The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan's concert in Buenos Aires on October 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-prosecutors-charge-3-linked-to-the-death-of-former-one-direction-star-liam-payne/7856252.html	2024-11-07T19:59:01-08:00	
DNA evidence rewrites long-told stories of people in ancient Pompeii	When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries. Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died. But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem — and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes. 'We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,' said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. 'It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.' Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace — long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter — was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s. Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims. There were several surprises in 'the house of the golden bracelet,' the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family. DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing 'the story that was long spun around these individuals' was wrong, Mittnik said. Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants – underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 241 kilometers from Rome. The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist. 'They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,' said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. 'We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.' Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dna-evidence-rewrites-long-told-stories-of-people-in-ancient-pompeii/7856244.html	2024-11-07T19:36:41-08:00	
US judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant spouses	WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge in Texas on Thursday ruled against President Joe Biden's program offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program blocked through Biden's final months in office. U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker found the program exceeded Biden's executive authority. The program offers a path to citizenship to about 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally if they are married to U.S. citizens. The initiative, known as Keeping Families Together, launched in August but was blocked days later by Barker, who left it frozen while he considered a legal challenge brought by Texas and a coalition of U.S. states with Republican attorneys general. Biden, a Democrat, announced the program in June before dropping out of the presidential race and paving the way for Vice President Kamala Harris to face Republican Donald Trump, an immigration hard-liner. Trump defeated Harris in Tuesday's election and is expected to launch a wide-ranging immigration crackdown that would likely include rolling back Biden's initiative for immigrant spouses, which the Trump campaign called a 'mass amnesty' that would encourage illegal immigration. Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for Trump to address when he takes office in January, and a large majority believe he will order mass deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Thursday found. The Biden administration could appeal Thursday's court ruling. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-rules-against-biden-legalization-program-for-immigrant-spouses/7856229.html	2024-11-07T18:24:40-08:00	
Giuliani facing contempt charge in election workers case	A federal judge on Thursday threatened to hold former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in civil contempt if he failed to hand over his property to two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him. The valuables include a $5 million Manhattan condominium, a 1980 Mercedes-Benz once owned by actress Lauren Bacall, a jersey signed by baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and some cash accounts. The women said that they received death threats and that their reputations were destroyed after Giuliani falsely accused them of ballot fraud during Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman had ordered Giuliani to surrender the property by October 29 to Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss. However, when representatives of the women went to the former mayor's apartment last week, they found that most of its contents, including art and sports memorabilia, had been cleared out four weeks earlier, and that some items had been placed in storage on Long Island. Liman warned Giuliani in court on Thursday that he expected the women to ask that the former mayor be held in contempt if he continued to refuse to relinquish his possessions. 'He's not going to be in contempt if he's made efforts and it's impossible to comply with the order. But that's the standard that he's going to be held to,' Liman said. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy after the multimillion-dollar judgment, but his case was dismissed when a federal judge found that Giuliani had not provided a clear depiction of his finances. The judge's dismissal opened the doors for Giuliani's creditors, including the election workers, to file against him. Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the women, said in court Thursday that attempts to take possession of Giuliani's items have been met with 'delay and then evasion' tactics. The lawyer said Giuliani was apparently moving around his assets and had opened new bank accounts. Giuliani said in court that he had been 'treated rudely' by the people trying to take his assets. Giuliani's lawyers have unsuccessfully argued that their client should not be required to turn over his possessions while he appeals the judgment. 'Every bit of property that they want is available if they are entitled to it,' Giuliani told reporters Thursday. 'Now, the law says they're not entitled to a lot of them. For example, they want my grandfather's watch, which is 150 years old. That's a bit of an heirloom. Usually, you don't get those unless you're involved in a political persecution. In fact, having me here today is like a political persecution.' Giuliani, 80, who once enjoyed widespread popularity, has now been disbarred in New York and Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giuliani-facing-contempt-charge-in-election-workers-case-/7856219.html	2024-11-07T18:00:31-08:00	
What does Trump's election victory mean for NATO, Europe?	LONDON — America's allies in Europe are debating what Donald Trump's win in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could mean for their security and prosperity amid concerns that the next four years may once again be characterized by a turbulent transatlantic alliance. European interests About 50 European leaders met in Budapest on Thursday for a summit of the European Political Community, which was set up in 2022 in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe must stand up for itself as it prepares for the next Trump presidency in the United States. 'There is a geopolitical situation where it is clear that we have two blocs: the United States of America on one side and China on the other, which above all seek their own interests,' Macron told the other European leaders. 'I think that our role here in the European Union is not to comment on the election of Donald Trump, to wonder if it is good or not. He was elected by the American people, and he is going to defend the interests of American people and that is legitimate and that is a good thing,' he said. 'The question is, are we ready to defend the interests of Europeans? That is the only question that we should ask ourselves. And for me, I think that is our priority,' he said. NATO The NATO alliance remains the bedrock of Europe's security. 'The first implication for the alliance is how to continue support for Ukraine if there's an expected drawdown of military assistance from the U.S.,' said Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security at Britain's Royal United Services Institute. 'That can either be delivered through NATO — and there were some steps taken in this summer to sort of formalize those structures — but still significantly less than where it needs to be. It can also be done through the EU as well, which might increase slightly but probably not enough. Or it can be done bilaterally,' Arnold told VOA. 'I think actually the mechanisms are probably largely irrelevant. It's more about the cost to individual nations, and that's going to have to ramp up pretty quickly if they're going to be able to have that impact,' he said. Shortfall Does Europe have the capacity to make up any shortfall from a U.S. withdrawal of support for Kyiv? 'Yes, but it would take a lot more effort than Europe is making now,' according to analyst Ian Bond of the Center for European Reform. 'And I think there will be some, perhaps in Germany, perhaps elsewhere, who will say the Ukrainians are just going to have to put up with losing some of their territory. 'I think for the Baltic states, for the Nordic states, Poland — they will look at this and they will say, 'Russia is going to be an existential threat to us if it is allowed to control Ukraine. And therefore we must step up our efforts,'' Bond said. On the campaign trail, Trump said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war on day one, although he didn't elaborate on how that would be achieved. In the past he has boasted of a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Peace deal? Ukraine fears being forced into an unfavorable peace deal — and Europeans might change their calculations, said analyst Arnold of RUSI. 'There might be a bit of a worry where there's some within Europe who say, 'Why would we ramp up aid now if there's going to be a negotiated settlement fairly soon? And I think the real risk for Europe as a whole — the EU but also NATO — is that actually the U.S. and Russia might start to do these negotiations without them,' Arnold said. Leverage There are deeper concerns that the U.S. might withdraw wider support for European security. Former government officials say Trump considered pulling the U.S. out of NATO altogether in his first term. 'One of the very few consistent beliefs that Trump has held to since he entered politics has been the idea that the United States is being taken advantage of by its allies,' said Jonathan Monten, a U.S. foreign policy analyst at University College London. 'At times, Trump threatened to withdraw from the alliance altogether but was ultimately held back. So the million-dollar question … is whether or not he will actually act on that threat,' Monten told VOA. 'I think he likes the idea that he's keeping foreign allies as well as adversaries guessing as to his ultimate intentions. I think he sees that as a source of leverage, as a source of power,' he said. NATO's secretary general, Mark Rutte, who took over the role October 1, has struck a more upbeat tone, praising Trump for getting allies to spend more on defense. 'When he was president, he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2% [of GDP spending target],' Rutte told reporters in Budapest on Thursday. Tariffs It's not only security fears that are haunting European capitals. America's allies could also face economic turbulence when Trump enters the White House. 'The [Trump] claims of putting about 60% or more tariffs on all imports from China will have to have a major disruptive impact on world trade, and there will be repercussions on the EU, on Europe, on the U.K. and elsewhere. We can expect also tariffs on imports from the EU as well,' said Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at American University in Washington. 'One element that I think is going to be absolutely critical for Europe, for the EU, is to work on protecting its unity and its unanimity. Trump, I think, is likely to try to adopt a divide and rule approach,' Martin said. Unpredictability Trump's unpredictability means there is little Europe’s leaders can do to prepare, said Monten. 'They can try flattery,' he said. 'They can try to offer him deals that benefit him personally, but it's unclear what exactly they would have to offer. They can offer him the kind of stature or respect that comes along with a big grand summit or trade deal. He seems to crave that kind of respect. 'But when it comes to actual tangible concrete results, it is unclear what levers they have either to threaten him with or to cajole him with,' Monten told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-does-trump-s-election-victory-mean-for-nato-europe/7855683.html	2024-11-07T14:25:01-08:00

11 Somali soldiers killed in clash with al-Shabab militants	At least 11 Somali regional and federal government forces were killed in fierce fighting on Wednesday in the south of the country, officials said. The fighting occurred in the vicinity of Wayaanta, about 60 kilometers southwest of Kismayo, Jubaland state, after the government forces attacked a suspected gathering spot for the militants. Three officials with direct knowledge of the fighting who requested not to be identified because they are not allowed to speak with media told VOA Horn of Africa that 11 regional and government soldiers were killed, and more than 20 others injured. One of the officials claimed more than 20 al-Shabab militants also were killed in the encounter. An operation by the Somali forces last year in the same vicinity killed an al-Shabab commander who was said to be a deputy emir of the area, according to the regional officials. During last year’s operation, the U.S. military conducted a 'collective self-defense' airstrike against al-Shabab militants in the Wayaanta area, killing three fighters. Al-Shabab has been fighting successive Somali governments since 2006. The group controls large countryside areas in south-central Somalia. After the president of Somalia came to power in May 2022, self-organized local fighters supported by federal forces removed al-Shabab from vast areas in the central regions. Somalia’s intelligence and security agency last Sunday reported that as many as 27 al-Shabab militants were killed during a 12-hour-long operation in the vicinity of Yaaqle, about 50 kilometers north of Mogadishu in the Middle Shabelle region. In a statement, the agency said the targeted operation was carried out at a time when the militants were preparing to harm the public. Vehicles and other equipment also were destroyed during the 'successful' operation, the statement said. Despite the losses of men and territory, the group remains a threat to Somali and African Union forces, carrying out deadly raids. On the day Somalia intelligence reported the operation, two African Union soldiers were killed and a third was injured by an al-Shabab mortar attack Sunday on their base inside the perimeters of Mogadishu’s international airport. The group fired four rounds of a 107mm rocket during daylight. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-soldiers-killed-in-clash-with-al-shabab-militants/7855771.html	2024-11-07T13:32:04-08:00	
Amnesty International calls for end to crackdown on protesters in Mozambique	Nairobi — Amnesty International is calling on the Mozambican government to stop its crackdown on protesters challenging the results of last month’s elections. At least 20 people have been killed in post-election violence, according to human rights groups. Demonstrators rallied again on Thursday, burning tires and blocking streets. Police fired tear gas at hundreds of protesters in the capital, Maputo. Cidia Chissungo, who works with Amnesty International, said tensions are high in Mozambique. 'There are cases of people that have already been shot. We cannot confirm how many died this morning. We still have to analyze all the evidence we are receiving,' Chissungo said. 'There are dozens of people being arrested not only in Maputo but also in Nyambane province. We have cases of police using rubber bullets, as well. So, there is massive tension today, and nobody knows how this will end.' The October 9 vote extended the rule of the Frelimo Party, which has led the southern African country for 50 years. Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo was declared the winner of the presidential election with more than 70% of the vote. Opposition parties, civil society groups and electoral observers said the election was unfair and rigged in favor of Frelimo — allegations that Frelimo denies. Chissungo said security forces must halt violent crackdowns against demonstrators and address their grievances. 'Police should respect people's right to protest. There are cases of people just standing on the streets, and police decided to take them, and there are hundreds who have been arrested,' Chissungo said. 'If people are demanding and are criticizing the government, and they are saying they need clarification over the election, it is for the authorities to listen and respect people's rights to speak out if they think there is something wrong, and not shoot at protesters.' Human Rights Watch has called for the government to lift internet restrictions, which have further fueled a perception that authorities are trying to stifle the protests. Allan Ngari, HRW's Africa advocacy director, said lack of internet access and social media networks hinders people's rights. 'Sometimes it is working, sometimes it is not working. So, it is not an entire shutdown, but it is, rather, restrictions. And we [are] of the view that this violates multiple rights, including rights to freedom of speech, peaceful protests and from access to information,' Ngari said. 'But also, the internet has become a source of employment, business for people, and those who are impacted then by this restriction cannot make a living anymore.' Mozambique's internet was working Thursday, to the surprise of many after days of interruptions. But as tensions rise, South Africa closed its main border crossing with Mozambique on Wednesday for security reasons. The South African government also warned its citizens not to travel to Mozambique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amnesty-international-calls-for-end-to-crackdown-on-protesters-in-mozambique-/7855736.html	2024-11-07T13:20:03-08:00	
Wildfire northwest of Los Angeles burns out of control	CAMARILLO, California / JACKSON Township, New jersey — A wildfire northwest of Los Angeles burned out of control for a second day Thursday after destroying dozens of homes, but officials said firefighters could get a break with heavy winds expected to subside by evening. More than 10,000 residents remained under evacuation orders as the Mountain Fire continued to threaten about 3,500 structures in suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo in Ventura County. The blaze, which broke out around 9 a.m. Wednesday, had zero containment. County fire officials said crews working in steep terrain with support from water-dropping helicopters were focusing on protecting homes on hillsides along the fire's northeast edge near the city of Santa Paula, home to more than 30,000 people. 'It's been a long 26 hours since this incident started, and it remains dynamic and it remains dangerous,' Ventura County Fire Department Chief Dustin Gardner said at a Thursday morning briefing. Sharon Boggie said the fire came within 60 meters of her property in Santa Paula. 'We thought we were going to lose it at 7 o'clock this morning,' Boggie said outside her house Thursday as white smoke billowed through the neighborhood. She initially fled with her two dogs while her sister and nephew stayed behind. Hours later, the situation seemed better, she said. The National Weather Service said a red flag warning, which indicates conditions for high fire danger, would remain in effect until 6 p.m. Winds were expected to decrease significantly but humidity levels will remain critically low, forecasters said. Officials in several Southern California counties urged residents to watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees during the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds. The Mountain Fire was burning in a region that has seen some of California's most destructive fires over the years. From its start on Wednesday, the fire swiftly grew from about 1.2 square kilometers to more than 41 square kilometers in little more than five hours. By Thursday morning, it was mapped at just more than 57 square kilometers. At least 800 firefighters were assigned to the blaze and hundreds more were arriving from around the state, the department said. Numerous structures were affected, fire officials said, but the extent of the destruction won't be known until the 10 damage assessment teams deployed Thursday complete their work. First responders pleaded with residents to heed evacuation orders. Deputies contacted 14,000 people to urge them to leave as embers spread for up to 5 kilometers. Two fires on East Coast Across the country in New Jersey, crews were battling two fires Thursday. A blaze in Evesham Township in suburban Philadelphia was threatening 50 homes, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said. It could not immediately give a size estimate for the fire. 'This is the driest we've been in the agency's history,' said Jeremy Webber, a supervising fire warden with the Fire Service. Lack of significant rainfall since August contributed to the dry conditions, which prompted the state to strictly limit outdoor fires. The second fire, about an hour to the east in Jackson Township, was less than half contained. That fire, in the central portion of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, had grown to less than 1.2 square kilometers and was 40% contained as of midmorning Thursday, said Deale Carey, incident commander for the Fire Service. About 25 homes were evacuated near the Jackson fire, although residents were permitted to return Wednesday night. Joann Bertone lives near that fire and described animal and horse owners scrambling to arrange trailers to carry them to safety. 'It was extremely scary,' she said. 'I was up all night. It was nerve-racking.' The causes of both fires remained under investigation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wildfire-northwest-of-los-angeles-burns-out-of-control/7855757.html	2024-11-07T13:16:50-08:00

Taliban leaders in Afghanistan host rare official talks with India	Islamabad — Afghanistan's Taliban government has held talks with India on improving bilateral ties and seeking increased humanitarian assistance for the impoverished country, officials reported Thursday. Jitender Pal Singh, the Indian foreign ministry’s point-person for Afghanistan, led his delegation’s meetings with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and a rare interaction with Defense Minister Mohammad Yaqoob, among others, during the November 4-5 visit to Kabul. 'Yes, this was the first meeting with' Yaqoob, Indian media quoted Randhir Jaiswal, the foreign ministry spokesperson, as telling a weekly news conference in New Delhi on Thursday. Jaiswal stated that 'humanitarian assistance from India was the centerpiece of the meetings of JP Singh with Afghan officials.' He added that the Indian delegation also met with representatives of the United Nations agencies in Kabul. The spokesperson discussed the visit a day after Yaqoob’s office publicly shared details of his meeting with the visiting Indian delegation. It read that 'both sides declared their common desire to enlarge the bilateral relations … and expressed their interest in further reinforcing the interactions between Afghanistan and India.' Both sides reported that the discussions in Kabul also focused on how the Afghan business community could access the India-operated Chabahar port in Iran, which borders landlocked Afghanistan, to increase bilateral trade. On Thursday, Muttaqi’s office released details of his talks with Singh, saying the Taliban chief diplomat emphasized the need to improve bilateral political and economic relations and sought better visa facilitation for Afghan businessmen to help boost trade ties with India. The Taliban statement quoted Singh as describing New Delhi’s relations with Kabul as historic and 'important for his country.' He promised to enhance Indian visa facilities for Afghans, it added. The de facto Afghan leaders swept back to power in August 2021, when the United States and NATO troops left the country after almost two decades of war with the then-insurgent Taliban. The Taliban takeover prompted New Delhi and Western countries to close their embassies in Kabul and mostly moved their diplomatic missions to Qatar. No country has formally recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan, but several neighboring and regional countries, including China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and Qatar, have retained their embassies. India recently reopened its diplomatic mission in Kabul, manned by low-level diplomats. The International community has refused to recognize the Taliban regime over human rights violations, particularly its restrictions on Afghan women’s access to work and education. India’s engagement with the de facto authorities in Afghanistan is expected to raise apprehensions in neighboring Pakistan, as noted by analysts. Kabul’s ties with Islamabad lately have been strained over allegations that the Taliban harbor and support fugitive anti-Pakistan militants responsible for deadly 'terrorist' attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. The Pakistani military reported a fresh militant attack Thursday in a district on the Afghan border, saying the ensuing clashes killed four soldiers and five assailants. Taliban officials have denied Islamabad’s allegations, stating that no foreign militants are present in Afghanistan, and no one is allowed to use their territory to threaten neighboring countries. Pakistan officially recognized the first Taliban government in Kabul in the 1990s. It allegedly harbored and supported Taliban leaders, who directed years of insurgent attacks against U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan after being dislodged from power in late 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-leaders-in-afghanistan-host-rare-official-talks-with-india/7855651.html	2024-11-07T12:05:42-08:00	
US Federal Reserve cuts key interest rate by quarter-point	washington — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate on Thursday by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald Trump's presidential election victory this week. The rate cut follows a larger half-point reduction in September, and it reflects the Fed's renewed focus on supporting the job market as well as fighting inflation, which now barely exceeds the central bank's 2% target. Thursday's move reduces the Fed's benchmark rate to about 4.6%, down from a four-decade high of 5.3% before September's meeting. The Fed had kept its rate that high for more than a year to fight the worst inflation streak in four decades. Annual inflation has since fallen from a 9.1% peak in mid-2022 to a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September. In a statement after its latest meeting ended, the Fed said the 'unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,' while inflation has fallen closer to the central bank's target but 'remains somewhat elevated.' After their rate cut in September — their first such move in more than four years — the Fed's policymakers had projected that they would make further quarter-point cuts in November and December and four more next year. But with the economy now mostly solid and Wall Street anticipating faster growth, larger budget deficits and higher inflation under a Trump presidency, further rate cuts may have become less likely. The economy is clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals, with growth solid but hiring weakening. Consumer spending, though, has been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy and even re-accelerate inflation. Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed: Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of the Fed's half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after its September meeting. Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic growth under a President Trump. Trump's plan to impose at least a 10% tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as measured by the central bank's preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in September. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump's proposed 10% tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by mid-2026. Rate cuts by the Fed typically lead to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses over time. Yet this time, mortgage rates fell in anticipation of rate cuts but have since bounced back up as the economy has grown briskly, fueled by consumer spending. High borrowing costs not only for mortgages but also for car loans and other major purchases, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates. The economy grew at a solid annual rate just below 3% over the past six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers — rose strongly in the July-September quarter. But companies have scaled back hiring, with many people who are out of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. If economic growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, though, the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its rate cuts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-interest-rate-by-quarter-point/7855635.html	2024-11-07T11:53:27-08:00	
US health officials call for expanded bird flu testing for farm workers	Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick. Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers — or 7% — had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza. 'The purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,' Shah told reporters. The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry. Outside experts said it's notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms. 'This is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,' said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. 'It shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,' Rasmussen said in an email. The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection. High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said. Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing. The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-health-regulator-calls-for-expanded-bird-flu-testing-for-farm-workers/7855601.html	2024-11-07T11:51:06-08:00	
Turkish leader sees opportunity in Trump’s election	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is sometimes at odds with Western leaders but has made no secret of what he says were his warm dealings with President-elect Donald Trump during the U.S. leader’s first term.

Hurricane Rafael knocks out Cuba’s power	Hurricane Rafael has knocked out Cuba’s electric service after hitting the island Wednesday as a Category 3 storm, blowing down trees and utility towers in an island nation still reeling from earlier storms and recent power failures. In its latest report Thursday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm is 320 kilometers west-northwest of Havana and it had weakened to a Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained winds of about 155 km per hour. The storm is still expected to continue bringing heavy rains to the island Thursday, raising the threat of mudslides at higher elevations. The hurricane center said the storm made landfall in Cuba’s western Artemisa province Wednesday afternoon. More than 70,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Artemisa and neighboring Pinar del Rio province. State newspaper Granma said airports in the western part of the country, including in Havana and the resort town of Varadero, had been temporarily closed because of the storm. By Thursday morning, the newspaper reported power was being restored in the central and eastern parts of the country. Rafael was the latest blow to the communist-run country's already precarious electrical grid, which just two weeks ago collapsed multiple times, leaving many in the country without power for days. The Energy and Mines Ministry said it had already begun work to reconnect the national grid late Wednesday but warned that the process would be slower in western parts of the island, which were hardest hit by the storm. Rafael had knocked out power and dumped heavy rain on the Cayman Islands and Jamaica earlier in the week. Forecasters said Rafael is expected to move to the west later Thursday through the weekend. They said the storm should remain a hurricane for the next couple of days as it moves over the southern Gulf of Mexico and then weaken to a tropical storm by Saturday. No new watches or warnings have been posted for populated areas. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-rafael-knocks-out-cuba-s-power-/7855515.html	2024-11-07T10:55:31-08:00	
ICC judges unseal arrest warrant for alleged Central African Republic rebel	THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Judges at the International Criminal Court on Thursday unsealed an arrest warrant for an alleged rebel from the Central African Republic accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, extermination, rape and persecution more than a decade ago. According to his warrant, which was originally issued under seal in 2018, Edmond Beina commanded a group of about 100 to 400 fighters responsible for murdering Muslims in early 2014 in a village in the west of the impoverished nation. Prosecutors say Beina's group was part of the anti-Balaka, a mainly Christian militia that fought against the predominantly Muslim Seleka rebel force in 2013-2014. The fighting left thousands dead and displaced hundreds of thousands. The Central African Republic has been plagued by violence since 2013, when Seleka rebels forced then-President Francois Bozize from office. Anti-Balaka militias fought back, also targeting civilians and sending most of the Muslim residents of the capital, Bangui, fleeing in fear. ICC judges said in a written ruling that they unsealed the warrant for Beina's arrest after authorities in the Central African Republic challenged the admissibility of the case. The court did not reveal details of the challenge. Prosecutors allege that Beina was involved in crimes in the village of Guen in the country's west from February to April, 2014, including murdering Muslim civilians. He also commanded other fighters who carried out crimes, his warrant says. In one incident, prosecutors allege that Beina and his fighters stormed the compound of a Muslim community leader in Guen, where about 300 displaced people, including women and children were sheltering. 'Beina separated the civilians into groups and, at gunpoint, ordered the men and boys to lie down. Then, Beina summarily executed several Muslim men and boys with his Kalashnikov rifle, emptying one magazine and another,' the warrant said. 'Beina ordered his men to finish off any survivors,' it added, saying that at least 42 Muslim men and boys were killed in the attack. Three other alleged rebels from the Central African Republic are currently on trial at the court for their alleged roles in the sectarian violence in the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-judges-unseal-arrest-warrant-for-alleged-central-african-republic-rebel-/7855489.html	2024-11-07T10:31:31-08:00	
Mpox spread slows slightly in Africa	KINSHASA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — The spread of mpox has slowed down slightly across Africa, but the epidemic is not over, the African Union's health watchdog said Thursday. Fifteen countries across Africa recorded 11,453 mpox cases in the last four weeks, compared with 12,802 in the four weeks prior, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said during an online briefing. But the head of the Africa CDC, Jean Kaseya, warned the epidemic was not over. 'We are still in the acute phase of the outbreak that is pushing us to double our effort to control mpox in Africa,' Kaseya said. 'Unfortunately, we are still losing a number of people,' he said. Since the start of the year, authorities have recorded 50,840 mpox cases and 1,083 deaths across Africa. Central Africa accounts for more than 85% of cases and almost all deaths. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which has recorded more than 39,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths since the start of the year, launched a vaccination campaign last month that is still 'limited,' according to the Africa CDC. Some 51,649 people have been vaccinated in six provinces, the Africa CDC said. 'We hope that with these vaccines we can continue to support countries to stop this outbreak,' Kaseya said. Health agencies across the world have allocated just under 900,000 vaccine doses for nine African countries 'hard hit by the current mpox surge,' the Africa CDC said in a statement Tuesday. The countries include the DRC, Kenya and Uganda. 'The largest number of doses — 85% of the allocation — will go to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the most affected country, reporting four out of every five laboratory confirmed cases in Africa this year,' the statement said. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. It causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-spread-slows-slightly-in-africa/7855431.html	2024-11-07T10:06:42-08:00

Donald Trump's transition starts now. Here's how it will work	Washington — Donald Trump 's impending return to the White House means he'll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that the second won't look much like the first one Trump established after his 2016 victory. The president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump's team. That includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of Cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting to Republican control. Here's what to expect: What will the transition look like? Though the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time. He's already floated some names. Trump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to 'help make America healthy again,' adding that 'we're going to let him go to it.' Ahead of the election, Trump didn't reject Kennedy's calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal 'cost-cutting,' and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out. The transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition. In 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump's legal challenges of the election's results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn't begin until Nov. 30. Who is helping Trump through the process? Trump's transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect's adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term. Lutnick said this year's operation is 'about as different as possible' from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence. At the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original Cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible — a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style. Unlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's team didn't sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government's landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees and facilities. New transition rules In 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud — which hadn't actually occurred — cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden's incoming one for weeks. Four years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition. It wasn't until Trump's efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally ' ascertain a president-elect ' and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate. To prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election — even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that 'an 'affirmative ascertainment' by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,' according to agency guidelines on the new rules. The uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-s-transition-starts-now-here-s-how-it-will-work/7855323.html	2024-11-07T09:20:02-08:00

German governing coalition nears collapse after minister dismissed	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister Wednesday because of a budget dispute, collapsing a fragile three-party governing coalition and prompting opposition calls for snap elections. Scholz fired finance minister and Free Democrats Party (FDP) leader Christian Lindner following a lengthy and reportedly contentious meeting to address a shortfall in the nation’s budget. Lindner and his party had rejected tax increases and pushed for cuts in social programs, an idea rejected by the other two coalition members. The FDP is part of a governing coalition with Scholz’s Social Democrats Party (SPD) and the Green Party, put together following the 2021 elections. The action leaves Scholz leading a minority government with the Greens. He called for a confidence vote in the parliament in January, which would lead to new elections if he lost. But Thursday, the leader of Germany's conservative opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, Friedrich Merz, said the legislature should vote as soon as next week. 'There is absolutely no reason to wait until January of next year to ask for a vote of confidence,' Merz said. 'It is important that we now very quickly return responsibility for the formation of the German Bundestag to the voters in Germany.' At his own news conference Thursday, now-former finance minister and FDP leader Lindner agreed, saying an immediate confidence vote is the right thing for the country. Both Scholz and opposition leader Merz are expected to meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who urged 'reason and responsibility' from all sides. The German president is largely a figurehead who oversees the formation of the government and the approval and dismissal of government ministers. Germany’s government turmoil is likely to compound growing frustration with its mainstream parties and provide an opening for burgeoning populist movements, including the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD. With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union's two largest economies could hamper efforts by European leaders gathering Thursday in Budapest to form a unified response to Donald Trump’s resounding victory in U.S. elections. Some 50 European leaders are meeting for the European Political Community Summit, where Trump’s presidency raises the possibility of new U.S. tariffs, a turn in Russia's war in Ukraine and a weakening of the NATO alliance. The summit is hosted by Hungary’s far-right nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a Trump supporter.

Activists want more women in Botswana’s National Assembly	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Three out of 28 female candidates were elected to Botswana’s National Assembly in last week’s general election, as women’s rights activists called on the new administration to increase female representation in the nation’s politics. Helen Manyeneng of the new ruling party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, is one of the three female members of parliament in the 61-seat assembly. The UDC defeated the Botswana Democratic Party, which had held power since the country gained independence in 1966. Manyeneng said women face many challenges, including poverty, in their efforts to win political office. 'We have very low socio-economic status in Botswana as women,' she said. 'The past government showed no political will to assist. I think as a newly elected female MP, I am going to advocate for women economic empowerment.' Manyeneng said the patriarchal nature of Botswanan society, in which men have greater control over money and decision-making, restricts female participation in politics even though women are interested and capable. 'The issue is, who is supposed to elevate them?' she said. 'Who is supposed to assist them? If you allow yourself to be under a man ... who is assisting you financially, he will not allow you to stand for political position. The majority of men want to control. They don’t want to be controlled or don’t want to share that control with you.' The regional nonprofit organization Gender Links released a report on Botswana before the October 30 election. It raised concerns about 'missing women’s voices in politics.' Gender Links consultant Pamela Dube said Botswana has done too little to empower women. 'It is a sad situation,' Dube said. 'It has been like this for a very long time. Fifty-eight years later [since Botswana’s independence from the U.K.], we only have three women in parliament.' Botswana’s 'patriarchal society,' she said, 'does not believe women can lead, particularly in areas like politics.' On Wednesday, newly elected President Duma Boko used a special dispensation to name three more women to the National Assembly. 'We wanted to reach out as broadly as possible to bring in young women, in particular, with skills and visibility in society,' he said. 'And then of course, we had to look at increasing the number of women [in parliament].' The special appointments mean Botswana’s parliament has 9% female representation, still well below the Southern African Development Community target of 30%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/activists-want-more-women-in-botswana-s-national-assembly/7855206.html	2024-11-07T07:41:58-08:00	
CAR rebels surrender as Chad military joins in border peace efforts	Yaounde, Cameroon — The Central African Republic said Wednesday that several hundred rebels have surrendered and handed over their weapons over to government troops and U.N. forces. The rebels surrendered less than a month after the C.A.R reached an agreement with neighboring Chad to jointly protect the two countries’ 1,200-kilometer border. Officials now hope to organize local elections that were postponed in October due to insecurity. C.A.R. officials said it was hardship and ceaseless raids by government troops that forced many rebel fighters to drop their weapons and give themselves up. Mloubo Etienne, 36, was among several dozen fighters who defected from the Union for Peace rebel group this week. The UPC is one of the C.A.R.’s largest armed groups. Maloubo, speaking on state TV, said he surrendered because life was becoming unbearable without food in dense tropical rainforests near the C.A.R.’s southern border. He said many UPC rebel fighters along the northern border with Chad also want to surrender because Chad government troops have shut off the regular food supply. Maxime Balalou, the C.A.R.'s communication minister and government spokesperson, said some of the 105 fighters who surrendered their weapons in Bambari, the third-largest city in the country, belonged either to the UPC or anti-balaka rebel groups. He said that in another operation in the central commercial town of Kouango, 36 fighters, including three women, were disarmed. Balalou said rebels who disarm voluntarily will be handed over to the C.A.R. Center for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, where they will be economically and socially reintegrated or trained to join the country's troops. The anti-balaka are an alliance of rebel groups operating for the past 10 years. The government says its operations consist of attacking hideouts of rebels who refuse to surrender. The goal is to establish peace before the C.A.R. holds its first local elections in 36 years. The elections originally slated for October were postponed because of insecurity and a lack of readiness by political parties. Officials now say the elections will take place on Dec. 29, assuming conditions are favorable. As part of efforts to organize the elections, officials from the C.A.R. and Chad met in Bangui on Oct. 23 and agreed to establish a joint security force along their 1,200-kilometer border. Chad said it would deploy troops to the border with the C.A.R. to stop supplies from reaching rebel groups. The government says rebels still hiding in the bush will be killed if they do not surrender and hand their weapons over to government troops or forces of the U.N. stabilization mission in the C.A.R., or MINUSCA. The C.A.R. says its goal is to get at least half of an estimated 21,000 rebels in the central African state to surrender by the end of 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/car-rebels-surrender-as-chad-military-joins-in-border-peace-efforts/7855214.html	2024-11-07T07:41:44-08:00	
Trump moving quickly to consider key appointments	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is moving quickly to consider appointments to key positions in his new White House administration and could name some choices within days. Trump, fresh off his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's presidential election, has been huddling with aides at his oceanside Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida to mull over his options. Even before the election, transition chiefs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon met with some potential candidates for top-notch jobs, either in the White House or to head the government's Cabinet-level departments and an array of other agencies. Trump aides also have prepared a long list of possible executive orders and regulation reversals for him to sign on his first day in office on January 20, to end policies that have been adopted by President Joe Biden over the last four years. Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election and was running for reelection until a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June forced him from the contest, has promised a peaceful transition back to Trump. Biden has invited the president-elect for a White House visit in the coming days and called him Wednesday to congratulate him. Biden is speaking on the election from the White House Rose Garden on Thursday morning. Biden on Wednesday praised Harris for her campaign, saying, 'She's been a tremendous partner and public servant full of integrity, courage, and character.' 'Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic campaign that embodied what's possible when guided by a strong moral compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just, and full of more opportunities for all Americans,' Biden said.

Plea deals revived for alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, others	WASHINGTON — A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck by alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the order by the judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, has not yet been posted publicly or officially announced. Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea deals again, McCall's ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the deadliest attacks on the United States. The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in exchange for the guilty pleas. Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the agreements. The plea deals in the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this summer. Within days, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time. The agreements, and Austin's attempt to reverse them, have made for one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given their years of torture in CIA custody. The Pentagon is reviewing the judge's decision and had no immediate further comment, said Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. Lawdragon, a legal news site that long has covered the courtroom proceedings from Guantanamo, and The New York Times first reported the ruling. Military officials have yet to post the judge's decision on the Guantanamo military commission's online site. But Lawdragon said McCall's 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss out the plea deals and acted too late, after Guantanamo's top official already had approved the deals. Abiding by Austin's order would give defense secretaries 'absolute veto power' over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials, the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling. While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the 9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences, legal experts say it's not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11 cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals. The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations, whether Austin's plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by 'clean teams' of FBI agents that did not involve violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plea-deals-revived-for-alleged-9-11-mastermind-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-others/7855078.html	2024-11-07T06:14:50-08:00	
Germany arrests US citizen suspected of offering military intel to China	Berlin — Germany has arrested a U.S. citizen suspected of offering intelligence on the U.S. military to China that he had acquired while working for troops stationed in Germany, the federal prosecutor's office said in a statement on Thursday. The man, identified only as Martin D. under German privacy law, is accused of having declared himself ready to work as an agent for a foreign intelligence agency, the statement said. The accused had worked for U.S. armed forces in Germany until recently, according to prosecutors. In 2024, he is said to have contacted Chinese state positions and offered to share with them sensitive information to pass on to Chinese intelligence. He had gathered the information through his work for the military, prosecutors said. Germany has warned of an increased risk of espionage from Beijing and arrested a number of people this year for alleged spy activities. This includes three Germans arrested in April on suspicion of working to hand over technology that could strengthen China's navy, as well as a European Union staffer of a far-right politician accused of working with Chinese intelligence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-arrests-us-citizen-suspected-of-offering-military-intel-to-china/7855074.html	2024-11-07T06:13:25-08:00	
In historic shift, American Muslim and Arab voters desert Democrats	In a historic shift, Muslim and Arab Americans broke with two decades of Democratic loyalty, splitting most of their votes between President-elect Donald Trump and third-party candidates in Tuesday's presidential election The exodus, fueled by anger over the Biden administration's handling of the war in Gaza, helped Trump win key battleground states as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. Less than half of the Muslim voters who voted backed Harris, according to an exit poll of more than 1,000 voters by the Council on American Islamic Relations. Most voted for either a third-party candidate or Trump, said Robert McCaw, CAIR's director of government affairs. 'This is the first time in the past in more than 20 years that the Muslim community has been split between three candidates,' McCaw said in an interview, with VOA. CAIR's exit poll findings are set for release on Thursday. The shift in the Muslim vote echoed among Arab American voters, who had backed Democratic presidential candidates 2-to-1 for more than two decades, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. 'And then you come to this election where Gaza took a toll and caused a great deal of dissatisfaction among demographic groups in the community that I wouldn't have expected it to have that degree of impact,' Zogby told VOA. 'What they saw happening in Gaza impacted them quite profoundly.' There are an estimated 3.7 million Arab Americans, most of them Christian, and a similar number of Muslim Americans. The voter revolt was strongest in Michigan's Arab strongholds of Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and Hamtramck. In Dearborn, where more than 55% of the residents are of Middle Eastern descent, Trump won more than 42% of the vote, up from 30% four years ago. Harris received just 36% from a community that gave President Joe Biden nearly 70% of its vote. In nearby Hamtramck, the first majority-Muslim city in the U.S., Trump picked up 43% of the vote, up from just 13% in 2020. Harris secured 46%, down from the 85% that Biden notched four years ago. Green Party candidate Jill Stein, a staunch critic of Israel's war in Gaza, pulled less than 20% of the vote in the two towns. Samraa Luqman, a Dearborn-based realtor and political activist, said the shift was 'absolutely astounding.' 'It's really, really, wow,' said Luqman, who campaigned for Biden last fall before switching sides over Gaza. The last time Muslim Americans overwhelmingly voted for a Republican was in 2000 when George W. Bush received the community's support. That changed after the attacks of 9/11. In recent years, however, some conservative Muslims started to drift back to the Republican Party over cultural issues. Anger over Gaza solidified the rightward shift, Luqman said. 'It really put the nail in the coffin for the Democrats for this election,' she said. Yet some experts urge caution in interpreting Harris' lackluster performance among Muslim voters. AP VoteCast showed the vice president captured 63% of Muslim votes overall, just slightly below Biden's 2020 showing, said Youssef Chouhoud, a professor at Christopher Newport University. 'While Dearborn is a unique case, I do think we need to wait and see what the larger trends are for Muslim voters nationwide,' added Saher Selod, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU). Still, Trump made noticeable inroads. After winning 35% of the Muslim vote in 2020, he actively courted Muslim and Arab voters this year, promising to end the Gaza conflict. Last week, he visited Hamtramck, whose Muslim mayor had endorsed him. 'His outreach didn't go unnoticed,' said Asm 'Kamal' Rahman, a Bangladeshi American who ran for mayor in 2021, and voted for Trump. Luqman said Trump's message of peace resonated with many voters. 'This year, he stated several times, and it became kind of like a model, that he wanted to stop the war, stop the war, stop the war,' Luqman said. While Gaza was the No. 1 issue among Muslim Americans, kitchen table issues also pushed many away from Harris, according to several activists and voters. 'I want people in office that are going to focus on solving the problems of Americans here at home, first and foremost,' said Nagi Almudhegi, a data analyst in Dearborn. An ISPU survey over the summer found that the economy was the No. 3 issue for most Muslim voters, after the Gaza conflict and ending foreign wars. 'They're feeling the pinch as much as anyone else, and so I think that's a major issue as far as just very specific sort of interests and concerns of the Muslim community,' said Chad Haines, co-director of the Center of Muslim Experience in the U.S. at Arizona State University. Haines, a Muslim convert who voted for Harris, said the election divided the Muslim American community between those who wanted to send Democrats a message over Gaza, and others who feared a Trump return. 'So ... one camp is happy that ... the Democrats have taken, in a sense, a hit, and another is deeply concerned about the next four years,' Haines in an interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-historic-shift-american-muslim-and-arab-voters-desert-democrats/7854995.html	2024-11-07T05:06:56-08:00	
US Asia allies nervously await second Trump term	U.S. allies in Asia are congratulating Donald Trump on his decisive victory in Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election, but many in Asia also worry about what the return of his 'America First' foreign policy means for their countries, as VOA's Bill Gallo reports from Seoul, South Korea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-asia-allies-nervously-await-second-trump-term/7854965.html	2024-11-07T04:43:17-08:00	
Britain hits Russia with new wave of sanctions	The British government said on Thursday it had imposed its biggest sanctions package in 18 months against Russia, targeting people involved in the Ukraine war, African mercenary groups and a nerve agent attack on British soil. The foreign ministry said it had sanctioned 56 entities and individuals, aiming to hurt Russian President Vladimir Putin's war effort and Russia's 'malign activity globally.' Among them were 10 entities based in China said to be supplying machinery and components for the Russian military. 'Today’s measures will continue to push back on the Kremlin’s corrosive foreign policy, undermining Russia's attempts to foster instability across Africa and disrupting the supply of vital equipment for Putin's war machine,' British foreign minister David Lammy said. The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Most of the measures were aimed at companies based in Russia, China, Turkey and Kazakhstan accused of aiding the Russian invasion of Ukraine with the supply of machine tools, microelectronics and components for drones. They include firms that European intelligence sources believe to be part of a Russian attempt to establish a weapons program in China, according to a Reuters report in September. Britain also said the latest sanctions would address Russian activity in Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic by targeting three private mercenary groups with links to the Kremlin, including the Kremlin-controlled Africa Corps, and 11 individuals. Amongst the individuals sanctioned was Denis Sergeev, whom British police have charged over the murder attempt on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripaland his daughter Yulia in the southern English city of Salisbury in March 2018. Sergeev, who Britain said was acting under the alias Sergey Fedotov, was one of three Russians said by Britain to have been GRU military intelligence officers suspected of carrying out the attack. Last month, a public inquiry into the death of a woman who was accidentally poisoned by the nerve agent heard that Skripal believed Putin himself had ordered the Novichok attack. Moscow has repeatedly rejected British accusations that it was involved.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-hits-russia-with-new-wave-of-sanctions/7854929.html	2024-11-07T03:51:54-08:00	
Canada orders TikTok's Canadian business to be dissolved but won't block app	Canada announced Wednesday it won't block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it. Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.'s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. 'The government is not blocking Canadians' access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,' Champagne said. Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information. He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada's national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community and other government partners. A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs. 'We will challenge this order in court,' the spokesperson said. 'The TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.' TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020. TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips. Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver. Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that 'banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.' Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S. Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said 'the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned' by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued. Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China's government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked. Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it. U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It's not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-orders-tiktok-s-canadian-business-to-be-dissolved-but-won-t-block-app/7854916.html	2024-11-07T03:31:12-08:00	
Taiwan braces for uncertainty following Trump’s victory	Taipei, Taiwan — Leaders from China and Taiwan have congratulated Donald Trump’s national election victory, despite growing uncertainty about how his second presidential term might impact dynamics across the Taiwan Strait. Chinese President Xi Jinping urged China and the United States to find the right way to get along in the new era, to benefit ‘’both countries and the wider world.' He hopes the two sides will 'uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences and expand mutually beneficial cooperation,' according to a readout released by China’s official Xinhua News Agency on Thursday. Meanwhile, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who came to power in May, said in a post on social media platform X that he is confident that the 'longstanding Taiwan-U.S. partnership, built on shared values and interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability and lead to greater prosperity.' On the Chinese internet, some social media users say they expect Trump to impose high tariffs on Chinese products but expressed mixed views on how the looming trade war might affect the Chinese economy. In Taiwan, some Taiwanese people express concern about the U.S. reducing their support for Taiwan under Trump’s second term due to his comments about Taiwan during the campaign and his isolationist approach to international affairs. 'Judging from his comments on Taiwan over the last few months, I worry the U.S. won’t be so supportive of Taiwan if they want to stabilize relations with China,' Lydia Yang, a 35-year-old marketing professional in Taipei, told VOA by phone. During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy. 'I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,' he said during the interview. In addition to asking Taiwan to pay for U.S. protection, Trump also accused Taiwan of stealing semiconductor technologies from the United States and threatened to impose tariffs against Taiwanese semiconductor companies. 'We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here. They're not going to give us the good companies anyway,' he said during an interview with Joe Rogan on October 25. Some Taiwanese people said these comments reflect Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy and underline that he would prioritize American interests once he returns to the White House next January. 'When it comes to things that don’t directly benefit the U.S., I would be worried about his approach,' Lai Ming-Wei, a 44-year-old engineer, told VOA in a recorded interview. The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a VOA request for comment regarding the president-elect’s policy toward Taiwan. Despite these concerns, some Taiwanese officials have tried to reassure the public that bilateral relations between Taiwan and the United States won’t significantly change under the second Trump administration. 'On relations across the Taiwan Strait, we believe that the United States will continue its current approach of constraining China and being friendly to Taiwan,' Tsai Ming-yen, Director-General of Taiwan National Security Bureau, told journalists on the sideline of Taiwan’s parliament on Wednesday. Analysts say while the basic elements of U.S.-Taiwan relations will remain the same, Trump’s campaign comments and more isolationist foreign policy approach could increase uncertainty for bilateral relations between Taipei and Washington. 'We don’t know what version of Donald Trump we are going to see and this kind of uncertainty doesn’t bring stability and predictability to the Taiwan Strait,' Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University, told VOA by phone. Other experts say Taiwan will have to take concrete actions to convince Trump that the island is serious about boosting its defense capabilities amid rising military pressure from China. 'Taiwan needs to offer something concrete, such as increasing the defense budget, because if Taiwan fails to do so, Trump may think Taiwan isn’t doing anything, so he doesn’t need to be too nice to Taiwan,' said Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, speaking by phone to VOA. Taiwan’s defense minister Wellington Koo said on Tuesday that Taipei must show its determination to defend itself regardless of who won the U.S. presidential election. 'We have to let them understand that Taiwan has the determination to defend itself, and the importance of Taiwan’s economic security and strategic geopolitical position,' he told journalists on the sidelines of the parliament. However, some Chinese analysts say Taiwan’s attempt to deepen military cooperation with the United States, including buying more weapons from Washington, would be counterproductive to the stability across the Taiwan Strait. Trump’s comments about Taiwan paying for U.S. protection mean 'he is asking Taiwan to increase their defense spending so they can buy more American weapons, but sending more arms to Taiwan wouldn’t help convince China that peaceful reunification is still possible,' Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in China, told VOA by phone. Despite concerns about Trump’s potential policies toward Taiwan, based on his campaign comments, some analysts say it remains to be seen how his administration will formulate Taiwan policies. 'There are different voices in his camp. There are voices focusing on the economic competition side, which is represented by Trump himself, and there are voices talking about pulling away from Europe and focusing more resources in Asia to compete with China, and there are voices looking at drawing together U.S. assets, including allies, to compete hard with China,' Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore, told VOA by phone. However, he said Taiwan should be prepared for potential inconsistency in Trump’s approach as he tends to 'cycle through officials very quickly' during his first term in office. 'That inconsistency may create an impression that there’s an opening for Beijing,' Chong said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-braces-for-uncertainty-following-trump-s-victory-/7854890.html	2024-11-07T02:32:42-08:00	
Philippine coast guard to acquire 40 fast patrol craft from France	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines said Thursday its coast guard will acquire 40 fast patrol craft from France, with plans to deploy some of them in disputed areas of the South China Sea. The deal is the 'largest so far single purchase' in Manila's ongoing effort to modernize its coast guard, with deliveries set to start in four years, Philippine coast guard commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan told a news conference. He declined to provide specifications for the vessels, which Manila said will cost about $440 million, to be funded by development aid from the French government. He said some of the vessels will be deployed in the South China Sea, where Filipino maritime forces have figured in violent confrontations this year with China's coast guard — part of a festering territorial dispute over waters and land features. China claims most of the sea including waters close to the shores of the Philippines and several other neighbors, ignoring an international tribunal ruling that its claims are without legal basis. 'It is a game changer for us,' Gavan said, describing the vessels as 'fast enough to reach the edges of our exclusive economic zone' for law enforcement and other missions. 'This will form part of the force mix that we need to address the threats in the area,' he added. Under the deal, 20 of the 40 vessels will be built in the Philippines through a technology transfer that Gavan said will provide a boost to Manila's shipbuilding industry. 'The new (fast patrol craft) will help deter smuggling and illegal activities while ensuring the enforcement of maritime sovereignty in critical marine areas,' Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said in a statement. The Philippine coast guard currently has a small fleet of modern vessels, including two 97-meter patrol ships and 10 44-meter patrol ships, all built by Japan. The Japanese government is financing the construction of five additional 97-metre patrol vessels worth $418 million that will be delivered in 2027. AFP has contracted the French embassy in Manila for details of the deal and the vessels. The mission did not immediately respond.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-coast-guard-to-acquire-40-fast-patrol-craft-from-france-/7854885.html	2024-11-07T02:12:02-08:00	
Israel airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs	Israeli forces carried out airstrikes Thursday targeting Beirut’s southern suburbs, a day after strikes in eastern and southern Lebanon killed at least 40 people. Thursday’s attacks included a strike near Lebanon’s international airport, which came after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order telling people to leave the area. Israel’s military said Thursday it had conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah headquarters and military infrastructure in Beirut. Hezbollah’s new leader warned Wednesday that his forces will battle Israel until they are forced to appeal for peace. 'We will make the enemy seek to demand an end to the aggression,' Naim Kassem said in a pre-recorded speech from an undisclosed location. He said there could be a road to indirect negotiations if Israel stopped its attacks. 'When the enemy decides to stop the aggression, there is a path for negotiations that we have clearly defined — indirect negotiations through the Lebanese state and speaker [of parliament Nabih] Berri,' Kassem said. More than 3,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the 13-month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with the vast majority killed since hostilities dramatically escalated in mid-September and Israeli forces entered south Lebanon on October 1. More than 1 million people have been displaced. Gaza In the northern Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces have intensified their incursions targeting Hamas fighters in the past month, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people recently have been displaced. 'Between 75,000 and 95,000 people were estimated to remain in north Gaza. The death toll there over the past month is thought to be in the hundreds,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters Wednesday. On a positive note, a massive polio vaccination campaign wrapped up on Tuesday. Dujarric said in central Gaza there was 103% coverage achieved – meaning more children under age 10 were vaccinated than initially expected. In southern Gaza, 91% of children received the necessary double dose of the oral vaccine, but in northern Gaza, because of a lack of access from the fighting, only 88% coverage was reached. The effort was led by the World Health Organization, the U.N. children’s fund – UNICEF – and the U.N. relief and works agency for Palestine refugees, known as UNRWA. UNRWA canceled At the United Nations on Wednesday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini appealed for international support following the adoption of two new laws in Israel on October 28 that seek to ban the agency. They are set to take effect early next year. 'For the past year, UNRWA has been a lifeline for the people of Gaza,' Lazzarini told a meeting of the General Assembly. 'It is the only pillar of their lives left standing.' He said if Israel succeeds in dismantling UNRWA, it would result in the collapse of the U.N. humanitarian response to the Palestinians, which relies heavily on UNRWA’s long-established infrastructure. 'Without intervention by member states, UNRWA will collapse, plunging millions of Palestinians into chaos,' he warned. Israel officials have criticized UNRWA for years, alleging that Hamas uses its schools for terrorist activities and promotes an anti-Israel curriculum. After the October 7 Hamas terror attacks in Israel, the rhetoric intensified, and in January, Israel alleged that 12 UNRWA staffers were involved in the attacks. The staffers were immediately fired, and an internal investigation was launched. Israel has since made further public allegations against several UNRWA staffers, but the agency says it has not received any evidence or information to act upon. Ambassador Danny Danon said Wednesday that it is 'time to move on' from UNRWA. 'I’ve often spoken about Gaza’s future without Hamas, the same applies to UNRWA,' he told the assembly. 'Without UNRWA, cooperation could flourish. Without UNRWA, aid workers could be trusted. Without UNRWA, Gaza’s children might learn peace, not hate.' 'This attack against the U.N. is not only a smear campaign, it has real-life consequences,' Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said, noting the killing of 238 UNRWA staff in Gaza, the detention of several staffers by Israel, and strikes on UNRWA facilities, including shelters housing the displaced. UNRWA was established by a resolution of the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 to assist Palestinian refugees. 'I must voice my deep alarm at the decision taken by the Israeli parliament,' General Assembly President Philemon Yang told the meeting. 'It constitutes an intolerable affront to the authority of this Assembly, an affront to international law and, most importantly, an affront to the human dignity of innocent Palestinian civilians.' States expressed concern at the Israeli parliament’s move, and many pointed to the government’s campaign against UNRWA. 'The eviction of a U.N. agency by the decision of one single U.N. member state would set an alarming precedent globally and would constitute a grave violation of the U.N. Charter,' Belgium’s Ambassador Philippe Kridelka said on behalf of group of 16 states that support the organization. He echoed many other states, saying UNRWA’s role is indispensable and irreplaceable to the humanitarian effort, especially as Gazans face the potential of famine. 'In the face of the unprecedented threats and attacks targeting UNRWA and its staff, the General Assembly must show unprecedented resolve,' Ambassador Kridelka said. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in an attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. VOA United Nations Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

China pledges support for Myanmar's political transition	BEIJING — China's Premier Li Qiang expressed support for Myanmar's political reconciliation and 2025 election plans in a meeting with Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing on Wednesday, according to state media outlets. Li met army chief Min Aung Hlaing, on his first visit to China since seizing power in a 2021 coup, in Kunming in southwestern China's Yunnan province, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. The junta is planning an election next year in which opposition forces have either been barred from contesting or have refused to take part, dismissing it as a sham. The election is unlikely to be recognized by western governments, and political analysts expect it will perpetuate the military's dominant role in politics, after the generals intervened in 2021 to hit the reset button after a decade of tentative, civilian-led democracy. According to Myanmar's state media on Thursday, Li pledged China's support for Myanmar's election and voiced appreciation for the military government's efforts to seek dialog to end armed conflicts via political means. It quoted Min Aung Hlaing saying that for Myanmar's rebel alliances to participate in dialog, they need to present clear and specific actions for peace. According to the report, Li stressed that the border posts should remain under the control of the respective governments, and that China reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Myanmar and opposes actions that harm the country's interests. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup, particularly along its border with China, as the junta wrestles with a coordinated offensive by rebel groups calling themselves the 'three brotherhood alliance.' The alliance, comprising the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), the Arakan Army (AA), and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), has won a succession of victories along the frontier, including taking control of strategic border gates. Xinhua said Li also pledged China's willingness to strengthen solidarity and overall cooperation with Myanmar and offered to further promote the China-Myanmar economic corridor, Xinhua reported. He called upon Myanmar to protect the safety of Chinese nationals and organizations in the country, and highlighted the need for joint efforts to combat cross-border crime, including online gambling and telecom fraud. Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government (NUG) this week expressed concern that China's invitation to the junta chief could create misunderstandings between the people of Myanmar and China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7854856.html	2024-11-07T00:43:35-08:00	
European climate agency says this will likely be the hottest year on record -- again	CHICAGO — For the second year in a row, Earth will almost certainly be the hottest it's ever been. And for the first time, the globe this year reached more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming compared to the pre-industrial average, the European climate agency Copernicus said Thursday. 'It's this relentless nature of the warming that I think is worrying,' said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. Buontempo said the data clearly shows the planet would not see such a long sequence of record-breaking temperatures without the constant increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere driving global warming. He cited other factors that contribute to exceptionally warm years like last year and this one. They include El Nino — the temporary warming of parts of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide — as well as volcanic eruptions that spew water vapor into the air and variations in energy from the sun. But he and other scientists say the long-term increase in temperatures beyond fluctuations like El Nino is a bad sign. 'A very strong El Nino event is a sneak peek into what the new normal will be about a decade from now,' said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist with the nonprofit Berkeley Earth. News of a likely second year of record heat comes a day after Republican Donald Trump, who has called climate change a 'hoax' and promised to boost oil drilling and production, was reelected to the U.S. presidency. It also comes days before the next U.N. climate conference, called COP29, is set to begin in Azerbaijan. Talks are expected to focus on how to generate trillions of dollars to help the world transition to clean energies like wind and solar, and thus avoid continued warming. Buontempo pointed out that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold of warming for a single year is different than the goal adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement. That goal was meant to try to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times on average, over 20 or 30 years. A United Nations report this year said that since the mid-1800s on average, the world has already heated up 1.3 degrees Celsius — up from previous estimates of 1.1 degrees or 1.2 degrees. That's of concern because the U.N. says the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals of the world's nations still aren't nearly ambitious enough to keep the 1.5 degree Celsius target on track. The target was chosen to try to stave off the worst effects of climate change on humanity, including extreme weather. 'The heat waves, storm damage, and droughts that we are experiencing now are just the tip of the iceberg,' said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. Going over that number in 2024 doesn’t mean the overall trend line of global warming has, but 'in the absence of concerted action, it soon will,' said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson put it in starker terms. 'I think we have missed the 1.5 degree window,' said Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track countries’ carbon dioxide emissions. 'There’s too much warming.' Indiana state climatologist Beth Hall said she isn't surprised by the latest report from Copernicus, but emphasized that people should remember climate is a global issue beyond their local experiences with changing weather. 'We tend to be siloed in our own individual world,' she said. Reports like this one 'are taking into account lots and lots of locations that aren’t in our backyard.' Buontempo stressed the importance of global observations, bolstered by international cooperation, that allow scientists to have confidence in the new report's finding: Copernicus gets its results from billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world. He said that going over the 1.5 degree Celsius benchmark this year is 'psychologically important' as nations make decisions internally and approach negotiations at the annual U.N. climate change summit Nov. 11-22 in Azerbaijan. 'The decision, clearly, is ours. It’s of each and every one of us. And it’s the decision of our society and our policymakers as a consequence of that,' he said. 'But I believe these decisions are better made if they are based on evidence and facts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-climate-agency-says-this-will-likely-be-the-hottest-year-on-record----again-/7854854.html	2024-11-07T00:30:09-08:00	
China's exports soar past forecast as factories front-run Trump tariff threat	BEIJING — China's outbound shipments grew at the fastest pace in over two years in October as factories rushed inventory to major export markets in anticipation of further tariffs from the U.S. and the European Union, as the threat of a two-front trade war looms. With Donald Trump being elected as the next U.S. president, his pre-election pledge to impose tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% is likely to spur a shift in stocks to warehouses in China's No.1 export market. Trump's tariff threat is rattling Chinese factory owners and officials, with some $500 billion worth of shipments annually on the line, while trade tensions with the EU, which last year took $466 billion worth of Chinese goods, have intensified. Export momentum has been one bright spot for a struggling economy in China as household and business confidence has been dented by a prolonged property market debt crisis. Outbound shipments from China grew 12.7% year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Thursday, blowing past a forecast 5.2% increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 2.4% rise in September. Imports fell 2.3%, compared with expectations for a drop of 1.5%, turning negative for the first time in four months. 'We can anticipate a lot of front-loading going into the fourth quarter, before the pressure kicks in come 2025,' said Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'I think it is mainly down to Trump. The threat is becoming more real.' China's exports to the U.S. increased an annual 8.1% last month, while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7% over the same period. 'We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months,' Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. 'Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year.' 'Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as U.S. importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs,' she added. Trade data from South Korea and Taiwan pointed to cooling global demand, while German manufacturers have also reported they are struggling to find buyers overseas, leading analysts to conclude Chinese producers are slashing prices to find buyers or simply moving stocks out of China. An official factory activity survey for October showed Chinese factories were still struggling to find buyers overseas. 'If the PMI new export sub-index has been going down, and the export figure goes up, I think it is safe to say it's more of an inventory shift,' said Dan Wang, a Chinese economist based in Shanghai. Exporters also had help from a positive turn in the weather, enabling them to send out delayed orders. Typhoon Bebinca brought Shanghai to a standstill for one day in September, causing severe disruption to one of China's busiest ports. In the eastern province of Jiangsu a violent tornado killed at least 10 people and several other regions suffered heavy rain and strong winds, disrupting production. Natural disasters cost China 230 billion yuan ($32.23 billion) in direct economic losses over the third quarter, according to data from the Ministry of Emergency Management. Economists have cautioned Chinese policymakers against becoming too reliant on outbound shipments for growth and urged officials to introduce more stimulus. Analysts are now turning their attention to a $1.4 trillion fiscal package officials are likely to sign off on this week, which they expect to stabilize local government and property developers' balance sheets and ease the strains that have weighed on consumption. China's trade surplus came in at $95.27 billion last month, up from $81.71 billion in September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-exports-soar-past-forecast-as-factories-front-run-trump-tariff-threat/7854850.html	2024-11-07T00:18:45-08:00	
South Korean president does not rule out sending weapons to Ukraine	Ukrainian officials reported damage to residential buildings Thursday after overnight Russian drone attacks, while South Korea’s president said he would not rule out sending weapons to Ukrainian forces. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that the Russian attack damaged houses and apartment buildings in five districts in the Ukrainian capital. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said Ukrainian air defenses shot down more than three dozen drones over the Kyiv region, and that two people were injured. In the Odesa region in southern Ukraine, Governor Oleh Kiper said Thursday falling drone debris damaged several buildings and injured one person. Serhiy Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, reported on Telegram that Russian drone attacks damaged five houses overnight, but did not cause any injuries. Officials in Cherkasy, Kherson and Mykolaiv also said Thursday that air defenses shot down Russian drones in their regions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over Voronezh, where officials said there were no reports of damage or casualties. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a news conference Thursday in Seoul that his government will 'gradually adjust our support strategy in phases' depending on how much North Korea becomes involved in Russia’s war in Ukraine. 'This means we are not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons,' Yoon said. South Korean and U.S. officials have said North Korea has more than 10,000 troops deployed to Russia’s Kursk region. On Wednesday, foreign ministers from the Group of 7, along with South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, issued a joint statement expressing 'grave concerns' over 'DPRK’s direct support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,' referring to North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including the DPRK’s export and Russia’s unlawful procurement of DPRK ballistic missiles in breach of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs), as well as Russia’s use of these missiles and munitions against Ukraine,' the ministers said, warning that this could dangerously expand the conflict with serious implications for European and Indo-Pacific security. They also voiced serious concerns about any potential transfer of nuclear or missile-related technology from Russia to North Korea. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse, Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-does-not-rule-out-sending-weapons-to-ukraine/7854845.html	2024-11-06T23:55:14-08:00	
Russia to curb income of 'foreign agents' and those who leave, lawmaker says	Moscow — Russia plans to significantly tighten the rules governing the income received by those deemed 'foreign agents' and of those who speak negatively about Russia after leaving the country, the speaker of the Russian parliament said on Thursday. Russian law requires any person or organization receiving support from outside Russia or who is under foreign influence to register as a 'foreign agent,' a label that has negative Soviet-era connotations and brings onerous bureaucratic requirements. Russia says the law is less strict than the 1938 U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, though the Russian law has been applied to almost all of the leaders of the divided opposition and is considered by some dissidents to be a badge of honor. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, said that the Duma was working on tightening the rules over copyright and intellectual rights payments to foreign agents by forcing them to use special ruble accounts for such payments. The rules would cover all income from intellectual activity and brands, including works of science, literature and art, performances, broadcasting, inventions and trademarks. 'Those who destroy Russia by insulting its citizens, the participants of the special military operation, should not enrich themselves at the expense of our country,' Volodin, who often floats Kremlin-backed initiatives, said on Telegram. Russia officially presents the war in Ukraine as a 'special military operation,' though many Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin often also refer to it as a war. Volodin added that Russia was working on measures to tighten the rules over the income of those people not classed as foreign agents but who have left Russia and speak negatively about Russia. A total of 881 people and organizations are listed as foreign agents by the Russian justice ministry, including former billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Nobel prize winner Dmitry Muratov and prominent YouTube blogger Yuri Dud. Supporters of Putin say the foreign agent law is necessary to counter Western attempts to meddle in Russia's domestic affairs amid what Putin casts as a proxy war in Ukraine between Russia and the West. Russian officials say that the pro-Western cultural elite which grew up after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union is being cleared out and replaced by patriotic singers, writers and artists who will ensure Russia remains sovereign. Opponents of Putin say the law is part of an intricate system of repression which has turned Russia into a brittle authoritarian state in which legendary Russian artistic and scientific creativity is stifled.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-curb-income-of-foreign-agents-and-those-who-leave-lawmaker-says/7854843.html	2024-11-06T23:35:49-08:00	
Vaccine doses allocated for 9 African countries hardest hit by mpox	An initial 899,000 vaccine doses have been allocated for nine countries across Africa that have been hit hard by the current mpox surge, the WHO and other health organizations said on Wednesday. The WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August after a new variant of the virus, called clade Ib, spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighboring countries. In September, after facing criticism on moving too slowly on vaccines, the World Health Organization cleared Bavarian Nordic's BAVA.CO vaccine for mpox and said it was considering LC16, made by Japan's KM Biologics as a potential vaccine option. The WHO also set up a scheme to help bring mpox vaccines, tests and treatments to the most vulnerable people in the world's poorest countries, similar to efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The global health agency said on Wednesday the newly allocated vaccines will go to the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. The largest number of doses – 85% of the allocated vaccines – will go to the Democratic Republic of Congo as the most affected country, the WHO said. The allocated vaccines are from European countries, the United States, Canada and Gavi, a public-private alliance that co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries. According to the latest WHO figures, there have been more than 46,000 confirmed and suspected cases of mpox in Africa this year, and more than 1,000 deaths in the continent due to the viral illness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vaccine-doses-allocated-for-9-african-countries-hardest-hit-by-mpox/7854842.html	2024-11-06T23:29:15-08:00	
Australia proposes 'world-leading' ban on social media for children under 16	sydney — The Australian government will legislate for a ban on social media for children under 16, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday, in what it calls a world-leading package of measures that could become law late next year. Australia is trying out an age-verification system to assist in blocking children from accessing social media platforms, as part of a range of measures that include some of the toughest controls imposed by any country to date. 'Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,' Albanese told a news conference. Albanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys. 'If you're a 14-year-old kid getting this stuff, at a time where you're going through life's changes and maturing, it can be a really difficult time, and what we're doing is listening and then acting,' he said. A number of countries have already vowed to curb social media use by children through legislation, though Australia's policy is one of the most stringent. No jurisdiction so far has tried using age verification methods like biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off, two of the methods being tried. Australia's other world-first proposals are the highest age limit set by any country, no exemption for parental consent and no exemption for pre-existing accounts. Legislation will be introduced into the Australian parliament this year, with the laws coming into effect 12 months after being ratified by lawmakers, Albanese said. The opposition Liberal Party has expressed support for a ban. 'The onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access,' Albanese said. 'The onus won't be on parents or young people.' 'What we are announcing here and what we will legislate will be truly world-leading,' Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said. Rowland said platforms impacted would include Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook, as well as Bytedance's TikTok and Elon Musk's X. Alphabet's YouTube would likely also fall within the scope of the legislation, she added. TikTok declined to comment, while Meta, Alphabet and X did not respond to requests for comment. The Digital Industry Group, a representative body that includes Meta, TikTok, X and Alphabet's Google as members, said the measure could encourage young people to explore darker, unregulated parts of the internet while cutting their access to support networks. 'Keeping young people safe online is a top priority ... but the proposed ban for teenagers to access digital platforms is a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges,' said DIGI Managing Director Sunita Bose. 'Rather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,' she added. France last year proposed a ban on social media for those under 15, though users were able to avoid the ban with parental consent. The United States has for decades required technology companies to seek parental consent to access the data of children under 13, leading to most social media platforms banning those under that age from accessing their services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-proposes-world-leading-ban-on-social-media-for-children-under-16/7854820.html	2024-11-06T21:20:58-08:00	
China expects bumpy relations with the US under Trump	Taipei, Taiwan — Following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s sweeping victory, Chinese netizens said they expect the U.S. to increase trade tensions with China while analysts say Washington’s efforts to counter China’s expansion might weaken under a second Trump administration. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to impose tariffs, between 60% to 200%, on Chinese products on several occasions. During an interview with Fox News on February 4, Trump said he would impose more than 60% tariffs on Chinese imports but emphasized he wasn’t going to start a trade war with China. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he would tax China at 150% to 200% if Beijing decides to 'go into Taiwan.' Some Chinese internet users expect Trump to follow through on the campaign promise to impose huge tariffs on Chinese products but have mixed views about how the tariffs will affect the Chinese economy and their livelihoods. Amid China’s ongoing economic downturn, some Chinese social media users worry that Trump’s return to the White House could exacerbate the economic pressure on many Chinese citizens. 'It’s hard to look at Trump’s victory with pure joy, because he is going to launch a trade war with China when he comes into power, and our economy will suffer further,' a Chinese netizen in the capital, Beijing, wrote on the popular microblogging site Weibo, which is similar to X. 'How will the lives of normal citizens change? I’m feeling a sense of unease about the unpredictability of the future,' the person added. Others say the 60% tariff on Chinese imports to the United States that Trump proposed during the campaign will push Chinese companies to redirect exports from the U.S. to other markets, including Southeast Asia, South America and Europe. 'Trump’s approach of being [an] enemy with the whole world may make some left-wing regimes in Europe disappointed, and this development may lead to a de-escalation of trade tensions between China and Europe,' Niu Chun-bao, chairman of Shanghai Wanji Asset Management Co., posted on Weibo. Some Chinese netizens predict the immense pressure that Trump is likely to impose on Beijing will enhance China’s domestic unity, and his transactional approach to resolving tensions may offer more room for negotiation and bargaining. 'As long as there are no major internal problems, no external pressure can overwhelm China. So, I think the overall situation may still be positive,' another netizen in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong wrote on Weibo. 'Significant hit’ While Chinese netizens hold mixed views about the potential tariffs that Trump has vowed to impose on Chinese imports, analysts say this move would be 'a significant hit' to the Chinese economy, which has been troubled by an ongoing property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak domestic demand. If Trump decides to impose 60% tariffs on all Chinese products imported to the U.S., 'This would be a return to a big-picture trade war rather than a narrow tech war. And it would have a much deeper impact on China’s export-driven growth potential because he is hitting the entirety of China’s exports to the U.S.,' Jacob Gunter, an expert on China’s political economy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA by phone. In Gunter’s view, Trump may use the tariffs to force China to make more concessions on trade. After imposing up to 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods imported to the U.S. in 2019, the Trump administration and China reached a trade deal that saw Beijing promise to increase purchases of American goods to at least $200 billion. 'We could see a return to the deal-making Donald Trump, where he wants to strike a deal and be viewed as this great negotiator, because that’s who he imagines himself to be,' Gunter said, adding that it remains to be seen how Trump might position the tariffs during his second term. Other experts say one thing to look out for is what concessions Trump might make during a potential negotiation with China. 'One big question is whether Trump will soften the position the Biden administration has maintained on Taiwan in exchange for more exports and more U.S. investment into China,' Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French investment bank Natixis, told VOA by phone. The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a VOA request for comment regarding his administration’s trade plans with China once he takes office in January. In response to potential tariffs that the incoming Trump administration could impose, analysts say China could impose counter-tariffs on U.S. agricultural products from states controlled by the Republican Party. 'Economic and political tensions between the two countries will inevitably rise, while the global economy and global supply chains will be thrown into chaos,' Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University, told VOA in a written response. Weakened coordination with allies While trade and economic tensions between China and the U.S. are expected to rise during Trump’s second term, Zhu said Trump’s return to power may also be good news for Beijing, as Washington’s efforts to counter China’s expansion of its influence in the Indo-Pacific region may be weakened due to Trump’s isolationist approach in international affairs. 'Trump is more likely to push ahead with his agenda without consulting allies and partners or seeking their support, and this might be good news for China,' Zhu told VOA. 'China can take a ‘divide-and-conquer’ strategy to dilute the effectiveness of Trump’s foreign policy, especially the Indo-Pacific strategy, and we may see improvements in China’s relations with its neighbors, particularly Japan, South Korea and India, as well as U.S. allies in other parts of the world,' Zhu added. In his view, bilateral relations between China and the U.S. will be dominated by competition under the second Trump administration, but there is also room for diplomacy and cooperation. 'Competition itself is not necessarily harmful, because if the two countries can manage the competition in a healthy way, both sides can benefit,' Zhu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-expects-bumpy-relations-with-the-us-under-trump-/7854808.html	2024-11-06T20:15:18-08:00	
New details emerge in Iran’s first execution of Jewish minority member in 30 years	WASHINGTON — New details have emerged about Iran’s rare execution this week of a member of its tiny Jewish minority. VOA has learned that Arvin Ghahremani, the first Jewish person executed by the Islamic Republic in 30 years, was put to death in the western city of Kermanshah on Monday without prior notice to his family. Iranian authorities had convicted Ghahremani, who was in his early 20s, of murdering a Muslim man in a 2022 street altercation over money, following a legal process that rights activists denounced as unfair and tainted by antisemitism. A U.S.-based source with contacts in Iran sent VOA the text of a letter that Ghahremani’s Iranian lawyer, Peyman Saketkhou, wrote on Tuesday and stated that Ghahremani had been executed without notice to family members or defense lawyers. Saketkhou said he had done everything he could to try to vacate the death sentence, but the family of the man who Ghahremani killed had exercised its legal right to reject financial compensation from the Ghahremani family in lieu of execution. The source also sent VOA a funeral notice printed by Ghahremani’s immediate family, informing mourners that his funeral would be held on Wednesday at Kermanshah’s Etehad Synagogue, where his uncle is a community leader. Other relatives of Ghahremani live in Los Angeles, the source added. The funeral notice was first published on X by Iranian American journalist Karmel Melamed on Tuesday. The source requested anonymity to safeguard communications with Iran-based lawyers, whose work on cases dealing with sensitive issues has exposed them to harassment and arrest by Iranian authorities. 'The execution of Ghahremani without notice to the family shows the cruelty of the regime,' George Haroonian, an Iranian American rights activist, said in a statement to VOA. Kermanshah is home to one of Iran’s smallest Jewish communities. The largest is in the capital, Tehran. The State Department’s latest annual report on international religious freedom, published in June, cites the Tehran Jewish Committee as saying Iran has about 9,000 Jews out of an estimated total population of 89 million people. Iran’s last execution of a Jewish community member was in February 1994. Feysollah Mechubad, a 77-year-old man, was executed at the time for 'associating with Zionism,' a reference to the Islamic Republic’s archenemy, Israel. Prior to that, Iran executed two other Jews — Habib Elghanian and Avraham Boruchim, in 1979 and 1980, respectively, at the start of its Islamic Revolution. The Biden administration issued its first reaction to Ghahremani’s execution on Wednesday. 'We are dismayed by reports that the regime in Iran executed Arvin Ghahramani. The circumstances of the case and prosecution raise troubling questions about due process,' U.S. special envoy Deborah Lipstadt said in a post on the X platform. Iran's U.N. mission in New York declined to comment when asked by VOA for a response to Lipstadt's statement. In May, when Iranian authorities transferred Ghahremani to death row, Lipstadt noted in another X post that the Islamic Republic 'often subject(s) Jewish citizens to different standards when it comes to determining judgements in cases of this nature.' Ghahremani had been sentenced to death under Iran’s Islamic legal principle of qisas, or an 'eye for an eye.' It gives a victimized party the right to inflict harm on the perpetrator that is similar to what the victim suffered, or to accept blood money from the offending party or to forgive that offender. In a report published Monday, Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights cited an informed source as saying Ghahremani’s religion initially was cited as Shiite Muslim in the case, and the family of the Muslim man he killed had agreed to accept blood money from Ghahremani’s family. But the group said the slain man’s family changed its mind and insisted on execution after discovering that Ghahremani was Jewish. 'Institutionalized antisemitism in the Islamic Republic undoubtedly played a crucial role in the implementation of [Ghahremani’s] sentence,' Iran Human Rights said. The group said Ghahremani’s court-appointed lawyer also 'did not effectively defend [him] for unknown reasons and [Ghahremani’s] right to self-defense was not properly presented in the case.' Another Iran-based rights group, Human Rights Activists in Iran, reacted to Ghahremani’s execution by noting that under Iranian law, when a Muslim kills a non-Muslim, qisas does not give the non-Muslim’s family the right to seek the offender’s execution. It said that in such cases, only blood money or lesser punishments typically are imposed. Israel responded quickly to Ghahremani’s execution with a strongly worded statement. In a Monday post on X, the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s Persian-language X account published a photo of Ghahremani with the message: 'The regime of the Islamic Republic once again showed the world that it is nothing but a criminal and bloodthirsty sect.' Inside Iran, leaders of the Jewish community issued more restrained messages on their social media channels. Iran’s designated Jewish lawmaker, Homayoon Sameh Yeh Najafabadi, used his Telegram channel to post a screenshot of a condolence letter to his community, while prominent Iranian rabbi Yehuda Gerami posted an Instagram photo of Ghahremani in a prison uniform and added a traditionally impassive Hebrew blessing: 'Blessed is the true judge.' Thamar Gindin, an Iran expert at the Ezri Center at Israel's Haifa University, told VOA in an interview that Gerami does not want trouble with Iranian authorities over his social media postings. 'One wrong word from him can mean trouble for the whole Iranian Jewish community. He has responsibility for the welfare of many people,' she said. Beni Sabti, a Persian Israeli researcher at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies, said in a separate interview that another factor in the restrained response of Iranian Jewish community leaders is the nature of the crime for which Ghahremani was executed. 'You have to consider this case in proportion. It was about Ghahremani killing someone, not about him being Jewish,' he said. Sabti said his sources in Iran’s Jewish community privately expressed to him their shock and sadness at Ghahremani’s execution but felt they could do little about it. Gindin noted that Ghahremani was one of many people executed by Iran recently. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported last week that Iran executed at least 161 prisoners in October, more than doubling the previous month’s total of 78 executions. 'The Islamic Republic is at a very weak point right now, particularly in its conflict with Israel,' Gindin said. 'So, the regime has to execute more Iranians to send its people a message that such weakness will not extend toward the regime’s domestic opponents as well,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-details-emerge-in-iran-s-first-execution-of-jewish-minority-member-in-30-years/7854788.html	2024-11-06T18:58:11-08:00	
Thousands ordered to evacuate from wind-fed Southern California wildfire	CAMARILLO, Calif. — California was lashed by powerful winds Wednesday that fed a fast-moving wildfire, which destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of residents to flee. Forecasters also warned of the potential for 'extreme and life-threatening' blazes. Northwest of Los Angeles, the Mountain Fire exploded in size and prompted evacuation orders for more than 10,000 people as it threatened 3,500 structures in suburban communities, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo, according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom. He said he has requested federal assistance for the area east of the Pacific coast city of Ventura. The blaze was burning in a region that has seen some of California's most destructive fires over the years. A thick plume of smoke rose hundreds of feet into the sky Wednesday, blanketing whole neighborhoods and limiting visibility for firefighters and evacuees. The fire grew from less than 1 square kilometer to 62 square kilometers in little more than five hours. Ventura County Fire Captain Trevor Johnson described crews racing with their fire engines to homes threatened by the flames to save lives. 'This is as intense as it gets. The hair on the back of the firefighters' neck I'm sure was standing up,' he said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon. At one spot, flames licked the burning remains of a home. Its roof was reduced to only a few charred shingles. Two people suffered apparent smoke inhalation and were taken to hospitals, fire officials said. No firefighters reported significant injuries. The erratic winds and limited visibility grounded fixed-wing aircraft, and gusts topped 98 kph, said weather service meteorologist Bryan Lewis. Water-dropping helicopters were still flying. First responders pleaded with residents to evacuate. Deputies made contact with 14,000 people to urge them to leave as embers spread up to 4 kilometers away and sparked new flames. 'This fire is moving dangerously fast,' Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner said. Aerial footage from local television networks showed dozens of homes in flames across several neighborhoods as embers were whipped from home to home. Other footage captured horses trotting alongside evacuating vehicles. Meanwhile to the south, Los Angeles County Fire Department crews scrambled to contain a wildfire near Malibu's Broad Beach as authorities briefly shut down the Pacific Coast Highway as flames burned near multimillion-dollar properties. Residents were urged to shelter in place while aircraft dropped water on the 20-hectare Broad Fire. It was 15% contained early in the afternoon, with forward progress stopped. Fire officials said two structures burned. The National Weather Service office for the Los Angeles area amended its red flag warning for increased fire danger with a rare 'particularly dangerous situation' label, and officials in several counties urged residents to be on watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees amid the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds. With predicted gusts between 80 kph and 160 kph and humidity levels as low as 8%, parts of Southern California could experience conditions ripe for 'extreme and life-threatening' fire behavior into Thursday, the weather service said. Forecasters also issued red flag warnings until Thursday from California's central coast through the San Francisco Bay Area and into counties to the north, where strong winds were also expected. Utilities in California began powering down equipment during high winds and extreme fire danger after a series of massive and deadly wildfires in recent years were sparked by electrical lines and other infrastructure. On Wednesday, more than 65,000 customers in Southern California were without power preventatively, and upward of 20,000 in Northern California.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-ordered-to-evacuate-from-wind-fed-southern-california-wildfire-/7854764.html	2024-11-06T17:51:29-08:00

European leaders congratulate Trump amid fears about future transatlantic ties	London — U.S. allies in Europe have congratulated President-elect Donald Trump following his comprehensive victory in Tuesday’s presidential election, despite deep concerns across the continent over what his second term may mean for transatlantic relations. In Britain, the so-called 'special relationship' with America has long been treasured. However, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer got off to a difficult start with the Trump team last month after officials in his Labour Party offered election advice to his rival, Kamala Harris, on the campaign trail. Nevertheless, Starmer was among the first of the world leaders to congratulate Trump in the early hours of Wednesday. 'I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the U.K.-U.S. special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,' Starmer said. Changes ahead German chancellor Olaf Scholz said Europe should expect changes. 'Many things will certainly be different under a government led by Donald Trump. Donald Trump has always made that clear publicly. Our messages are clear,' Scholz told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday. 'Firstly, Germany will remain a reliable transatlantic partner. We are aware of the contribution we make to this partnership and will continue to make in the future. This also applies with regard to the threat that all NATO allies believe Russia poses to security in the Euro-Atlantic area.' Russian reaction Russia gave a muted reaction to Trump’s victory. 'It is almost impossible to worsen [U.S.-Russia ties] further — the relationship is at its historically lowest point. And then it will depend on the next leader of the United States,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday during a phone call. Trump has frequently criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights Russia’s invasion, and there are fears he could end military and financial aid for Kyiv. NATO In his first term in office, Trump threatened to pull the United States out of NATO, claiming allies were taking advantage of the U.S. security umbrella by failing to share the burden of defense spending. However, in a statement Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte focused on Trump’s positive contributions to the alliance, claiming he had 'turned the tide on European defense spending, improved transatlantic burden sharing, and strengthened alliance capabilities' during his first term. EU agenda During Trump’s first term in office, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was the defense minister of Germany, a country then frequently berated by the U.S. president for failing to meet NATO defense spending targets. In a statement issued Wednesday, von der Leyen said she looked forward 'to working with President Trump again to advance a strong transatlantic agenda.' 'Let us work together on a transatlantic partnership that continues to deliver for our citizens. Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship,' von der Leyen added. 'Shining victory' Hungary’s President Viktor Orban made no secret of his preference for a Trump victory during the campaign. In a video posted online, Orban said Trump’s victory would resonate in Europe. 'I see a shining victory, perhaps the biggest comeback of the history of Western politics. It’s been a huge fight. He was threatened with prison, his wealth was confiscated, they wanted to kill him, the whole media world turned against him in America, and he still won,' said Orban. 'For the world, it means the hope of peace. At the start of the year, we hoped that by the end of the year the pro-peace forces will be in the majority, and we will defeat the pro-war forces. Now, there is a huge chance for this,' he added. Macron relationship French President Emmanuel Macron has had a volatile relationship with Trump since the latter’s first election win in 2016. Macron invited Trump as guest of honor for the Bastille Day parade in Paris in 2017, but the two men frequently clashed in online exchanges. Macron said Wednesday he was ready to work together 'with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' Tension ahead Despite the warm words, European allies are preparing for a stormy ride, said Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy Center at the American University in Washington. 'The four years where Trump was in office were rather tumultuous. There were moments of constant bickering, a lot of disunity, a lack of cohesion. So, I think that was already at a time which was less arguably dangerous than it is now. 'We’re now in the midst of a major war in Europe that’s been going on for two-and-a-half years. So, at the very minimum, we can assume it’s the case that we will see a repeat of the tension,' Martin told VOA. Climate talks Europe is also deeply concerned over the possible impact of a second Trump term on global efforts to combat climate change, with next week’s crucial COP29 summit in Azerbaijan likely to be overshadowed by his election victory. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2017, claiming the commitments to cut emissions were unfair to his country. Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, rejoined the deal on his first day in office in 2021. There are fears Trump will once again quit the agreement, even as scientists warn of catastrophic global warming without immediate action.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-leaders-congratulate-trump-amid-fears-about-future-transatlantic-ties/7854350.html	2024-11-06T16:50:56-08:00

What to expect on immigration under a new Trump administration	washington — President-elect Donald Trump put immigration at the front of his campaign agenda, pledging to bring what he calls 'unprecedented order' to the southern border and launch the nation’s largest mass deportation operation of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office. Throughout his campaign, Trump called immigration a crisis and vowed to move swiftly to implement a series of controversial policies to clamp down on illegal immigration and curb new arrivals. 'We are going to fix our borders. … We want people to come back in, but we have to let them come back in. They have to come in legally,' Trump said during his victory speech in Florida on Tuesday. However, managing the re-entry of possibly millions of people presents formidable legal and logistical challenges. 'There’s this belief that there’s a line and people should stand in line. Oftentimes, there’s not a line,' Mark Hetfield, CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told VOA. A Migration Policy Institute report makes the same point, saying there are multiple visa pathways, each with distinct backlogs and wait times, governing how long individuals wait for permanent residency. Annual limits and country quotas create extensive delays, with some applicants facing waits lasting decades. Many undocumented immigrants may have no way to join these lines because of restrictive re-entry policies. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act blocks re-entry for immigrants with a history of 'unlawful presence' in the U.S. If they leave and want to re-enter legally, those with more than 180 days but less than one year of unlawful presence face a three-year re-entry ban. Those with more than one year of unlawful presence face a 10-year ban. Unlawful presence generally includes overstaying or entering without inspection. Largest deportation campaign in US history Trump has vowed to surpass deportation numbers from his first term. With plans to use the National Guard to round up undocumented immigrants, Trump has also invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century law that allows the president to deport noncitizens from nations deemed hostile to the United States. Trump aims to drastically reduce the undocumented population, something his supporters see as a step toward restoring order, though opponents argue it will lead to legal battles and logistical hurdles. Jeremy Robbins, executive director of the American Immigration Council, wrote in an email to VOA that should any president choose to pursue mass deportation, it would come at an extraordinary cost to the government while also devastating the economy. 'It’s critical that policymakers and the American public understand what this would involve: tens of billions of taxpayer dollars, already-strained industries devastated, millions of people locked up in detention, and thousands of families torn apart causing widespread terror and chaos in communities across the country,' Robbins wrote. Travel ban, birthright citizenship and more The Remain in Mexico program, a program initiated in the first Trump administration, is expected to be renewed. The policy forces migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while their cases are processed. Also expected to be renewed is a policy to quickly expel migrants and curb immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. Another central promise Trump made during his presidential campaign is to roll back initiatives under the Biden administration that have allowed specific groups of migrants to enter the U.S. legally. Under Biden, up to 30,000 migrants per month from four countries — Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela — were allowed to come to the U.S. legally if they met certain conditions. Trump has pledged to end these pathways. In an effort to intensify scrutiny of those entering the U.S., Trump has promised to renew and expand travel bans aimed at a broader list of countries and introduce an 'ideological screening' to bar individuals whom Trump describes as 'dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs.' Trump’s campaign says this measure will enhance national security, though it has sparked concerns over discrimination and civil liberties. Trump also said he plans to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally. This would require a reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment and is expected to face intense legal challenges. While Trump’s immigration plans have the support of his base, they face steep opposition from advocacy groups and legal experts, who argue that mass deportations and travel bans could lead to human rights violations and extensive court challenges. Hetfield of HIAS told VOA that advocates are concerned about what a new Trump administration will do to legal immigration. 'We will likely litigate if he tries to close down the [refugee] program and oversteps. … But the bottom line is, the president has a lot of discretion when it comes to the refugee program. … And for asylum, [he’s] going to make it impossible to apply at the border as he did with Title 42 and his Remain in Mexico policies,' Hetfield said. Michelle Ming, political director at United We Dream, the nation's largest immigrant youth-led organization, said they will be ready to 'protect' immigrant families. Ming anticipates a significant amount of 'know your rights' events throughout Trump’s second term in the White House. 'Once Trump takes office, we're going to remind him that we are here to fight back against any kind of policy that he tries to implement to hurt our communities,' Ming said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-expect-on-immigration-under-a-new-trump-administration-/7854408.html	2024-11-06T16:02:03-08:00	
Erdogan welcomes second Trump term	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday was quick to welcome Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory.

China pushes divisive narratives amid heated US election	As the polling sites across the U.S. started counting votes Tuesday in the highly contested U.S. presidential race, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency published a satirical video titled 'Presidential Election Victory Speeches of the Divided States of America.' Posted on social media platform X, Xinhua’s video lampooned President-elect Donald Trump and his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, capitalizing on divisive U.S. political and societal topics. Mocking the issue of gun violence in America, an actor portraying Harris said, 'We are rolling out bullet vending machines in every grocery store.' The actor portraying Trump said that 'while kids are being shot by stray bullets,' Americans will 'have to pass a background check to buy bubble gum.' The video similarly portrayed the Trump and Harris stand-ins as having farcical views on economic and environmental policy, criticized the U.S. for providing military aid to its allies, and ridiculed a potential ban of the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok. Similar to disinformation spread by other U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran, China’s disinformation narratives targeting U.S. elections focused on efforts to undermine the U.S. democratic system as a whole. Like Russian and Iranian state-run media outlets, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s Global Times newspaper predicted 'post-election unrest.' Xinhua published an Election Day piece outlining eight key issues that reveal 'the truth about American democracy.' They included problems with inflation, health care, crime, education, abortion, housing affordability, shale gas and immigration — all of which Xinhua described as 'urgent.' The article presented the United States as failing politically and economically, and it cast the presidential candidates as using these issues to get popular votes despite being incapable of enacting genuine change. Lu Xiang, an expert on U.S. studies and research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that 'neither candidate will accept defeat easily, because they have bet too much on this campaign.' Harris already debunked such speculation. Following U.S. political tradition, she called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and publicly conceded the race. Publicly, China has denied any effort to sway the vote in the U.S. When asked Wednesday about Trump’s victory, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning called the election 'an internal affair of the United States.' 'China respects the choice of the American people,' she added. However, researchers have documented China’s influence operations in the leadup to Tuesday’s poll. On Tuesday, the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) of the Atlantic Council published a study that found a Chinese bot network had amplified apparently Russian-produced content intended 'to undermine the integrity of the 2024 U.S. election.' 'These videos amplified disinformation narratives alleging rigged votes, destroyed ballots, malfunctioning machines and dead voters, with some suggesting that Vice President Kamala Harris benefited from these supposed instances of election fraud,' DFRLab said. Authorities said those and other malign narratives Russia pushed through its 'interference campaign' preyed on 'an already tense political climate,' Agence France-Presse reported. While China has long used social media platforms to counter negative reports about the CCP and its human rights records, researchers at Microsoft found that China has in recent years spread messages intended to undermine the U.S. and 'sow discord along racial, socioeconomic and ideological lines.' In an August report, Microsoft found that the CCP-linked influence actors continued to 'engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues.' Like Iran, China sought to stoke social tensions over U.S. support for Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Microsoft found that one CCP-linked influence group, Taizi Flood, 'leveraged hundreds of accounts to stoke outrage around pro-Palestinian protests at U.S. universities.' Taizi Flood assets portrayed themselves as being students involved in the protests, reacted 'in real time as students clashed with law enforcement across campuses,' and provided directions to demonstration locations, Microsoft found. A September report from the research company Graphika similarly found that China had 'become more aggressive in its efforts to influence U.S. political conversations ahead of the 2024 presidential election.' As with Taizi Flood, that included an expansion of efforts to impersonate U.S. voters on social media platforms to spread 'divisive narratives about sensitive social issues in the U.S.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pushes-divisive-narratives-amid-heated-us-election/7854389.html	2024-11-06T15:31:32-08:00	
Fear, joy and calls for a strong Europe: France reacts to Trump win	PARIS — A century of straw polls at the iconic Harry’s Bar in Paris have accurately called almost every U.S. election. This November was no different. The tallies displayed on the bar’s window on a chilly Wednesday morning were another reminder of Donald Trump’s decisive victory — with uncertain consequences for France and Europe. Even as some French celebrate the former president’s comeback to the White House, others fear its repercussions and wonder whether their country will follow the same rightward tilt in its own 2027 presidential elections. 'I guess we’re disappointed but unfortunately not surprised,' said freelance producer and Paris resident Charlotte Danglegan. 'The fascist powers are taking more and more importance, and it’s the same case in France.' Not everyone sees it that way. On social media platform X, right-wing French politician Eric Ciotti saluted Trump’s victory as 'a magnificent victory against a system, a hope for peace and a defeat for wokists.' David Gil, a member of the far-right National Rally Party is also pleased. 'For us, it’s good news,' he said. 'But it’s a bit early to see what it means for France.' French President Emmanuel Macron was an early bird in congratulating Trump — sending his wishes to work 'for more peace and prosperity,' before the Republican’s win was officially confirmed. But Macron followed that message with another on X, declaring he and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wanted to work 'for a Europe more united, stronger, more sovereign in this new context.' French government officials echoed similar themes, reflecting Macron’s longstanding push for beefing up Europe’s military and other defenses. 'We need to find ways to work on our common interests, but fundamentally, the answer lies with us,' European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad told France Inter radio. Europeans, he said, 'can’t accept that their security will be decided without them, that tomorrow a capitulation will be imposed on Ukrainians without them, without the Europeans.' Cooling relations Macron struck up initially cordial relations with Trump during his first term in office, marked by the U.S. president’s visit to Paris in 2017 during Bastille Day celebrations. But ties cooled over differences on trade, climate change and Iran. Now, there are other areas of disagreement, including the future of Ukraine and support for NATO. 'It’s really time for us to wake up and do something,' said Jean-Yves Camus, an analyst at the Jean Jaures Foundation in Paris. 'Because if we do not have the military capacity to weigh in on Ukraine and the Middle East, then we are dependent on what Washington will do.' For their part, French businesses are worried about the potential impact of Trump’s promised tariffs on imports, which could affect industries such as beverages and aeronautics. Still, observers say, France is less exposed to a potential trade war than other countries, including neighboring Germany. Walking near Harry’s Bar, phone salesman Cameron Orilia said he had not been closely following the U.S. presidential campaign. 'I hope things will work out for business' during Trump’s term, he said, 'that customs will work out. I’m just looking at the economic side of the politics.' Wake-up call? But other Paris residents are worried about the political side. 'I feel a bit scared,' said Lucy Bone, a Briton who has lived in Paris for 25 years. 'I’m thinking [about] what happened to all our democracies? We are now going to be in a world that’s driven by dictators.' As with Americans, the French are worried about high prices and immigration — themes that catapulted Trump to victory. The hard-right National Rally emerged on top of both of France’s European and parliamentary elections this year. Today it holds the most seats of any party in the lower house — although not the majority. Some believe Trump’s election may set a precedent for National Rally leader Marine Le Pen to do the same in 2027. Still, Le Pen has been cautious in reacting to another four years under Trump, who remains highly controversial in France. 'The only thing I think about is France’s interest and Europe’s interest,' she told reporters Wednesday. Under a Trump presidency that defends U.S. interests, 'Europe has got to wake up' and do the same. 'Le Pen has been very, very strong in saying that National Rally members of parliament should not support President Trump, should not take sides in this election,' Camus said, 'for fear that the bad image of President Trump would damage her own chance of becoming president.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fear-joy-and-calls-for-a-strong-europe-france-reacts-to-trump-win/7854339.html	2024-11-06T14:31:32-08:00

Special counsel considers how to wind down 2 federal cases against Trump	WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith is evaluating how to wind down the two U.S. federal cases against Donald Trump before he takes office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Trump's election defeat of Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no longer face prosecution in accordance with decades-old department legal opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in office. The person familiar with Smith's plans was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press. By moving to end the cases before the inauguration in January, Smith and the Justice Department would avert a potential showdown with Trump. The president-elect said as recently as last month that he would fire Smith, who was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland, 'within two seconds' of taking office. NBC News first reported Smith's plans. Smith's two cases charge Trump in a conspiracy to undo the election results in the run-up to the Capitol riot, and with retaining top secret records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing FBI efforts to recover them. The classified documents case has been stalled since July when a Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, dismissed it on grounds that Smith was illegally appointed. Smith has appealed to the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the request is pending. In the 2020 election interference case, Trump was scheduled to stand trial in March in Washington, where more than 1,000 of his supporters have been convicted of charges for their roles in the Capitol riot. But the case was halted as Trump pursued his sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution that ultimately landed before the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump could be emboldened by the Supreme Court's ruling in July, which granted former presidents expansive immunity from prosecution for acts taken in the White House and explicitly put off-limits any alleged conduct involving Trump's discussions with the Justice Department. That included his efforts to use the Justice Department to conduct sham election fraud investigations as part of his bid to stay in power. The conservative-majority Supreme Court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which of the other allegations in the indictment, if any, could move forward to trial. In response, Smith's team last month filed a 165-page brief laying out new evidence to persuade the judge that the actions alleged in the indictment were taken in Trump's private capacity as a candidate — not as commander-in-chief — and therefore can remain part of the case. Trump's lawyers are scheduled to file their response later this month. Whatever Chutkan rules is expected to be appealed again to the Supreme Court, meaning a possible trial would be likely a year or more away.	https://www.voanews.com/a/special-counsel-considers-how-to-wind-down-2-federal-cases-against-trump/7854281.html	2024-11-06T13:21:32-08:00	
African presidents congratulate Trump on US election victory	Johannesburg — Donald Trump’s victory over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris dominated the news cycle across Africa on Wednesday, with coverage reflecting the anxiety being felt by some on the continent. In South Africa, the newspaper Business Day ran an opinion column headlined 'Trump’s comeback heralds harder U.S. approach to Africa,' while another local newspaper, The Sunday Times, was running a poll for readers asking: 'Are you worried about Donald Trump being elected U.S. president?' A cartoon by renowned South African political cartoonist Zapiro in the Daily Maverick newspaper depicted a frightened looking globe watching TV as U.S. election results came in. The markets were also affected, with South Africa’s currency, the rand, dropping almost 3% on the news in the early hours of trading. Trump inspires mixed views on the continent, having riled some by calling African countries a derogatory name in his first term, and being viewed positively by others as a kind of 'strongman' leader. Steven Gruzd, a political analyst with the South African Institute of International Affairs, told VOA that Trump did not pay much attention to Africa in his first term and he doesn't expect that to change. 'Africa is not going to be a priority for the second Trump administration by any measure, and I don’t think we should expect too much,' he said. 'I think we’re also going to see a world that has a very different USA in operation, and African countries will have to decide how they deal with that.' Asanda Ngoasheng, an independent analyst in Cape Town, said she believes a Trump presidency will affect Africa in terms of trade, with South Africa possibly seeing its exports to the U.S. reduced. Ngoasheng said public health funding for Africa could also be affected under the incoming Republican administration, particularly for reproductive health. Likewise, any reduction in U.S. contributions to the United Nations could have negative effects on the continent, she said. 'Donald Trump has been very clear that his administration will be an America-first administration. … This is going to have implications for Africa,' Ngoasheng said. As is diplomatic custom, leaders around the world congratulated the U.S. election winner. Kenyan President William Ruto, who recently paid a state visit to the U.S. at President Joe Biden’s invitation, praised what he called Trump’s 'visionary, bold and innovative leadership.' Nigerian leader Bola Tinubu said he hoped Trump’s presidency would usher in an era of 'beneficial and reciprocal economic and development partnerships' between Africa and the U.S. And South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa said he looked forward to continuing a 'mutually beneficial partnership' between the two countries. The statements come as African governments are hoping the U.S. will renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA, next year. The preferential trade policy gives some countries duty-free access to the U.S. market. However, the president of the Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan, had other concerns about what a second Trump presidency could mean for his Indian Ocean island nation, which is under particular threat from climate change and rising sea levels. 'We are going through a climate crisis, so will the U.S. once again pull out of the Paris Agreement? ... What will be the pronouncement of President Trump?' Ramkalawan asked. Ramkalawan, speaking at a press event in Johannesburg, was referring to the fact that in his first term Trump withdrew the U.S. from a major international agreement to limit global warming. The U.S. rejoined the pact under President Biden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-presidents-congratulate-trump-on-us-election-victory/7854269.html	2024-11-06T13:14:21-08:00	
Israel launches deadly airstrikes in Lebanon	Israeli airstrikes hit multiple towns in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley on Wednesday, killing and injuring dozens, as the new head of Hezbollah warned that his forces will battle Israel until it is forced to appeal for peace. 'We will make the enemy seek to demand an end to the aggression,' Naim Kassem said in a prerecorded speech from an undisclosed location. He said there could be a road to indirect negotiations if Israel stopped its attacks. 'When the enemy decides to stop the aggression, there is a path for negotiations that we have clearly defined — indirect negotiations through the Lebanese state and speaker [of parliament Nabih] Berri,' Kassem said. In the eastern Baalbek-Hermel governorate, Governor Bachir Khodr said on the social media platform X that at least 40 Israeli raids had killed 38 people and wounded 54. He said the work to remove rubble is ongoing at multiple locations. Hezbollah’s stronghold in Beirut’s southern suburbs was also targeted with at least four strikes on Wednesday, following Israeli military orders to residents to evacuate the area. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The death toll in Lebanon surpassed 3,000 on Monday, in the 13-month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with the vast majority killed since hostilities dramatically escalated in mid-September and Israeli forces entered south Lebanon on October 1. More than 1 million people have been displaced. In northern and central Israel, sirens sounded, including in the Tel Aviv area, as Hezbollah launched 10 rockets toward Israel. No casualties were reported. In Gaza Meanwhile, in the northern Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces have intensified their incursions targeting Hamas fighters in the past month, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people recently have been displaced. 'Between 75,000 and 95,000 people were estimated to remain in north Gaza. The death toll there over the past month is thought to be in the hundreds,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. On a positive note, a massive polio vaccination campaign wrapped up on Tuesday. Dujarric said in central Gaza there was 103% coverage achieved — meaning more children under age 10 were vaccinated than initially expected. In southern Gaza, 91% of children received the necessary double dose of the oral vaccine, but in northern Gaza, because of a lack of access from the fighting, 88% coverage was reached. The effort was led by the World Health Organization, the U.N. children’s fund known as UNICEF and the U.N. relief and works agency for Palestine refugees known as UNRWA. UNRWA under fire At the United Nations on Wednesday, UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini appealed for international support following the adoption of two new laws in Israel on October 28 that seek to ban the agency. They are set to take effect early next year. 'For the past year, UNRWA has been a lifeline for the people of Gaza,' Lazzarini told a meeting of the General Assembly. 'It is the only pillar of their lives left standing.' He said if Israel succeeds in dismantling UNRWA, it will result in the collapse of the U.N. humanitarian response to the Palestinians, which relies heavily on UNRWA’s long-established infrastructure. 'Without intervention by member states, UNRWA will collapse, plunging millions of Palestinians into chaos,' he warned. Israel officials have criticized UNRWA for years, alleging that Hamas uses its schools for terrorist activities and promotes an anti-Israel curriculum. After the October 7 Hamas terror attacks in Israel, the rhetoric intensified, and in January, Israel alleged that 12 UNRWA staffers were involved in the attacks. The staffers were immediately fired, and an internal investigation was launched. Israel has since made further public allegations against several UNRWA staffers, but the agency says it has not received any evidence or information to act upon. Ambassador Danny Danon said Wednesday that it is 'time to move on' from UNRWA. 'I’ve often spoken about Gaza’s future without Hamas, the same applies to UNRWA,' he told the assembly. 'Without UNRWA, cooperation could flourish. Without UNRWA, aid workers could be trusted. Without UNRWA, Gaza’s children might learn peace, not hate.' Palestinian envoy Riyad Mansour said, 'This attack against the U.N. is not only a smear campaign, it has real-life consequences.' He noted the killing of 238 UNRWA staff in Gaza, the detention of several staffers by Israel and strikes on UNRWA facilities, including shelters housing the displaced. UNRWA was established by a resolution of the U.N. General Assembly in 1949 to assist Palestinian refugees. 'I must voice my deep alarm at the decision taken by the Israeli parliament,' General Assembly President Philemon Yang said at the meeting. 'It constitutes an intolerable affront to the authority of this assembly, an affront to international law and, most importantly, an affront to the human dignity of innocent Palestinian civilians.' States expressed concern at the Israeli parliament’s move, and many pointed to the government’s campaign against UNRWA. 'The eviction of a U.N. agency by the decision of one single U.N. member state would set an alarming precedent globally and would constitute a grave violation of the U.N. Charter,' Belgian Ambassador Philippe Kridelka said on behalf of a group of 16 states that support the organization. He echoed many other states, saying UNRWA’s role is indispensable and irreplaceable to the humanitarian effort, especially as Gazans face the potential of famine. 'In the face of the unprecedented threats and attacks targeting UNRWA and its staff, the General Assembly must show unprecedented resolve,' Ambassador Kridelka said.

Hurricane Rafael strengthens to powerful Category 3 storm as it heads to Cuba	HAVANA — Rafael strengthened Wednesday into a powerful Category 3 hurricane ahead of its expected landfall in western Cuba, where it was forecast to bring 'life-threatening' storm surges, winds and flash floods. The storm, which knocked out power and dumped rain on the Cayman Islands and Jamaica, is expected to hit the Isle of Youth in the coming hours and make landfall later on Wednesday. Classes and public transport were suspended on parts of the island as authorities issued an alarm for the incoming weather for the west of the country. Workers secured buildings and cleaned up garbage along Havana's coastline in preparation for floods. Authorities also canceled flights in certain areas like Havana and Varadero. Thousands of people in the west of the island were evacuated as a prevention measure. 'Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,' warned the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The storm was located about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east-southeast of the Isle of Youth and around 135 kilometers (84 miles) south-southeast of Havana. It had maximum sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) and was moving northwest at 22 kph (14 mph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters expected the storm to later weaken over Cuba, but emerge in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. Cubans have already been struggling with blackouts while recovering from another hurricane two weeks ago that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to 'reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael.' On Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall 'it's important to stay where you are.' Silvia Perez, a 72-year-old retiree living in a coastal area of Havana, was among those scrambling to prepare. As other neighbors moved appliances and other furniture from ground floor homes, worried about floods, Perez stocked up on water and food. 'This is a night I don't want to sleep through, between the battering air and the trees,' Perez said. 'I'm scared for my friends and family.' A hurricane warning was in effect on Wednesday for a portion of the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Cuban provinces of Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The storm on Tuesday knocked out power in parts of Jamaica and unleashed flooding and landslides. The Jamaica Public Service, the island's electricity provider, said in a statement late Tuesday that impassable roads were preventing crews from restoring power in some areas. Power outages were reported across the Cayman Islands after a direct hit late Tuesday, and schools remained closed on Wednesday. 'While conditions have improved on Grand Cayman, residents are advised to exercise extreme caution on the roads and near coastlines as rough seas and residual flooding risks may persist,' the government said in a statement. Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwestern Florida. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2024 hurricane season was likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast called for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-rafael-strengthens-to-powerful-category-3-storm-as-it-heads-to-cuba/7854133.html	2024-11-06T11:22:20-08:00	
Netanyahu sparks uproar by firing popular defense minister	Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Tuesday, sparking protests around Israel. Some say the move could endanger the country’s security, as Israel continues to fight in both Gaza and Lebanon. After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the dismissal of his popular defense minister, thousands of Israelis took to the streets, blocking roads — including the main highway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem — and setting tires on fire. Police used force to break up the protests and arrested dozens of people. Netanyahu said he fired Gallant because he no longer trusted him. Netanyahu said full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister, especially in the midst of war, and while such trust existed at first, it has since cracked. An emotional Gallant said he disagreed with Netanyahu on several issues, including the need to draft ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, which is sharply opposed by key parties in Netanyahu’s coalition government. Gallant said he believed everyone of conscription age must serve in the Israel Defense Forces and defend the state of Israel, so he planned to vote against a proposed law to permanently exempt the ultra-Orthodox from army service. Netanyahu’s coalition partners have vowed to bring down the government unless the law is passed. Some Israeli analysts said Netanyahu fired Gallant in an effort to preserve his coalition and stay in power. The leaders of Israel’s opposition parties responded harshly to Netanyahu’s move, with opposition leader Yair Lapid calling it an act of insanity by an incompetent prime minister. Israeli analysts say the dismissal of Gallant could make it harder for Israel to meet its goals on both fronts of its current war — Lebanon and Gaza. Dr. Efraim Sneh, a former senior general, said Gallant’s replacement, Yisrael Katz, has no military experience. 'In a time of war, one of the most complicated wars in several arenas with a lot of complexities, in the middle of the war, the political person, the ministerial authority, above the IDF, someone with obviously no experience,' Sneh said. Netanyahu tried to fire Gallant a year and a half ago, before the war between Israel and Hamas had started. That time, he changed his mind amid demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of Israelis. Opposition groups are calling for large-scale protests again this time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-sparks-uproar-by-firing-popular-defense-minister/7854043.html	2024-11-06T10:33:43-08:00	
Nigerian president says army chief is dead	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian army chief Lieutenant General Taoreed Lagbaja has died, according to a statement Wednesday from the country’s president. On the social media platform X, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu announced Lagbaja’s death and expressed condolences to his family and Nigeria's armed forces. Lagbaja, 56, died in Lagos on Tuesday night after a period of illness, authorities said. They did not elaborate on his illness. Two weeks ago, Nigerian defense authorities denied rumors suggesting the army chief had died after his prolonged absence from the public and active duty. The Nigerian army has been fighting various adversaries across the country, including bandits and the Boko Haram insurgents. Lagbaja is not the first Nigerian army chief to die while on active duty in recent years. In 2021, Ibrahim Attahiru died in a military air crash along with 10 other high-ranking officials. Tinubu appointed Lagbaja in June 2023, shortly after taking office. Lagbaja launched a campaign seeking to repair the reputation of the military, which is often accused of mistreating civilians and extrajudicial killings. Last week, Tinubu appointed Olufemi Oluyede as acting army chief and, on Tuesday, promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-president-says-army-chief-is-dead/7854032.html	2024-11-06T10:32:56-08:00	
Iran Embassy in Paris says Iranian student in underwear protest moved to 'specialized care center'	Paris — An Iranian student who stripped to her underwear in Tehran to protest alleged harassment over her clothing has been transferred to a center of 'specialized care', the Iranian Embassy in Paris said Wednesday. 'The student in question suffers from psychological fragility and was transferred by an ambulance of the emergency social services to a specialized care center,' it said, without giving further details about the center. Concern has grown over the whereabouts and welfare of the young woman, with activists worried authorities could confine her in a psychiatric institution. The statement from the Paris embassy described her as a mother of two children who was separated from her husband. 'Once she has recovered she will resume her studies at the university. Although, of course, the final decision rests with the institutions concerned,' the embassy said. Persian-language media outlets outside Iran have reported that university security guards harassed her over what she was wearing, ripping her headscarf and clothes. She then took most of them off in protest. Footage shows her defiantly walking down the street before plainclothes agents bundle her into an unmarked car and drive away. Activists say there are past examples of Iran's authorities sending women who show opposition to the Islamic system to psychiatric institutions, particularly during the 2022-2023 nationwide protests. Amnesty International said late Tuesday that reports she was 'taken to an unnamed psychiatric hospital are very alarming', adding that it had 'previously documented how Iran's authorities equate defying compulsory veiling with 'mental disorders' that need 'treatment'.' In Tehran, the government has dismissed reports that the incident began with a dispute over her dress and denied she was violently arrested. The Iranian Embassy statement said that 'for her family the student needs care' and that it was essential to respect her 'dignity, intimacy and private life.' But the video of the student strolling calmly in Tehran amid other women in black Islamic chador dress has, for many, made her an icon for the struggle of Iranian women for their rights. Under the dress code mandatory in Iran, women must wear a headscarf and loose-fitting clothes in public. U.S.-based opposition campaigner Masih Alinejad, who for years has pushed for the abolition of the obligatory headscarf in Iran, said she had been told by associates of the woman that she was 'not only mentally sound but also a lively, courageous woman filled with joy and vitality.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-embassy-in-paris-says-iranian-student-in-underwear-protest-moved-to-specialized-care-center-/7854015.html	2024-11-06T10:24:10-08:00	
A US election watch party in Kenya, excitement at first, followed by disappointment	nairobi, kenya — In a vibrant Nairobi community center, American citizens living in Kenya gathered with palpable excitement early Wednesday to watch the U.S. election results unfold. The atmosphere buzzed with anticipation as expatriates shared snacks and stories, their eyes glued to screens displaying real-time updates. As the results of the U.S elections trickled in, a mix of American citizens and local Kenyan friends anxiously monitored the results. Robyn Emerson, an American expatriate in Nairobi and chairperson of Democrats Abroad Kenya, which organized the event, said all American citizens were invited to the event, regardless of the party they support. 'American voters have come to a central place so that we can be together and watch the election come in so that we can really celebrate the right to vote,' Emerson said. 'That we have done our part; we participated in a democratic process. And watching how the different states are coming in, and the results that are there.' Bentley Wilson, an independent voter from the western state of Utah, agreed. 'It’s important for us to see each other as one country. And no matter whether we go for a certain party, it’s important for us to come together because it's our country’s significance that’s at stake,' Wilson said. 'So, we better come together. I like coming together no matter whether I’m leaning one side or another, to come together with citizens of my country to support the cause of … choosing an elected official.' The Democrats Abroad Kenyan chapter estimates that approximately 30,000 American expatriates reside in the country. Tom Wolf, an American researcher based in Nairobi, said most expatriates are keen to engage in the election process back home. 'They are well educated people … or they wouldn’t be allowed to stay in Kenya, they wouldn’t have jobs here,' Wolf said. 'Whether they are diplomats or businesspeople, or with NGOs. So, they tend to be of higher education levels than the averages in their home countries. And we all know from studies of voting that people with higher education levels are more likely to vote.' Lisa Maroni, a native of Detroit, said the event provided her with a special opportunity to interact with fellow citizens. 'I’m so grateful for the community in Kenya. I think it’s really special. I’ve lived in other countries and never had such an opportunity to spend time with other Americans and friends,' she said. 'There are some allies from other countries here who are interested in what’s happening in the country, and I’m just very grateful to have somewhere to share that experience.' Given that the event was organized by Democratic Party supporters, the early morning excitement began to dissipate as it became clear that their candidate, Kamala Harris, was losing to the Republican, former president Donald Trump. Wilson, a Harris supporter, was among the disappointed people. 'I was really hopeful that we would vote the first U.S. woman and woman of color president this year,' Wilson said. Disappointed in the results, most of the participants started leaving the event and it ended earlier than scheduled.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-u-s-election-watch-party-in-kenya-excitement-at-first-followed-by-disappointment-/7853954.html	2024-11-06T09:55:41-08:00	
Bangladesh interim government revokes credentials of 50 journalists	Washington — The Bangladesh government has revoked the press credentials of dozens of journalists in a move that critics call an 'alarming' form of censorship. The interim Information Ministry in the past week scrapped the accreditation of over 50 journalists. Over 20 senior journalists had their credentials revoked on October 30, and another 30 suffered the same fate on Sunday, local media reported. Some of those affected include Zafar Wazed, former director-general of the Press Institute of Bangladesh; former press minister Shaban Mahmud; and journalists at outlets including ATN News, Ekattor TV, and The Dhaka Times, according to the Dhaka Tribune. Some media watchdogs said journalists who were supportive of the ousted Awami League political party appear to have been mainly affected. The Awami League government fell in August after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country after 15 years of power. Since then, an interim government has been formed under Nobel-laureate Muhammad Yusuf to prepare the country for new elections. The Bangladesh Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. The revoking of press credentials should be protested because of its 'chilling' effect on other journalists in the country and around the world, Celia Mercier of Reporters Without Borders, known as RSF, told VOA in an email. 'Such decisions threaten the growth of opposition media,' she said. 'This will encourage self-censorship, and critical space in media will shrink.' Media watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the action, saying on social media, 'The interim authorities must safeguard press freedom during this critical period of the country's political transition.' Hasina’s fall was prompted by student-led mass protests over proposed changes in university admissions policies and a deadly response by security forces. During the unrest, five journalists were killed, and others were beaten and fired at. Reporters at the time told VOA they were being threatened for their coverage. The country currently ranks 165 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment. RSF, which compiles the index, described the country as a 'hostile' environment for journalists, where editors often avoid challenging the government. During the last months of Hasina’s rule, 'draconian' laws for journalists emerged in the country, according to RSF. Her government introduced the Cyber Security Act in January, which allows authorities to imprison journalists for up to 14 years for publishing content that goes against the prime minister and the party in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-interim-government-revokes-credentials-of-50-journalists/7853955.html	2024-11-06T09:50:11-08:00	
Kenyan security forces accused of abduction, deaths of protesters	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human Rights Watch on Tuesday accused Kenyan security forces of abducting, torturing and killing people believed to be leaders of anti-government protests that took place between June and August. The group said security officers held abductees in unlawful detention facilities, including in forests and abandoned buildings, and denied them access to their families and lawyers. Mary Muthoni Mwangi of Kirinyaga, in rural central Kenya, said she lost her son in the protests, in which thousands of young Kenyans demonstrated against a bill that would have increased taxes. Her son, 20-year-old Kennedy Njeru, took part in a protest on June 25, she said, when demonstrators stormed the parliament after lawmakers passed the tax increase. Mwangi said she searched for her son for four days, finally finding his body in the city mortuary. She said a postmortem examination found a bullet wound to his head. Human rights groups say 61 people were killed across the country during the weeks of protests. Human Rights Watch blamed Kenyan security agencies for the abduction, torture and killing of people seen as leading or taking part in the demonstrations. Mausi Segun, head of HRW’s Africa division, said, 'Whoever the initial abductors were, the police were involved because people were taken to police stations and many times the torture happened while people were in police custody.' She added, 'Those who are dead, we don't have details of what happened to them, but people who witnessed their abduction said that individuals who took them away were clearly security agents.' HRW researchers spoke to 75 people, including victims, family members, journalists, parliament staff and police officers. The interviewees said that police officers hunted down protesters. But because the officers wore plain clothes, covered their faces and traveled in unmarked vehicles, it was difficult for family members, rights groups, lawyers and government agencies to trace victims’ whereabouts. Segun said some of those taken away were tortured and killed. 'Many of the bodies of those who have been abducted have showed up sometimes on the streets, sometimes in quarries, unmarked places where they have been dumped,' she said. 'Many of those bodies have shown signs of torture and dismemberment of body parts, showing what they went through at the hands of their captors,' she said. 'Many of these bodies have not been released to family members.' Kenyan security forces deny that their officers were behind the abductions and killings. President William Ruto, speaking at a town hall gathering in Kisumu in late August, said he was not aware of any abductions and called on family members to forward the names to the government to take action. Human Rights Watch said reports of abductions, missing people and killings are well documented and called on the president and other government institutions to hold those responsible to account. On September 24, Mary Mwangi was among dozens of activists and victims’ family members who tried to submit a list of the missing and dead to the president’s office. They were driven back with teargas. Ruto ultimately declined to sign the tax increase into law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-security-forces-accused-of-abduction-deaths-of-protesters/7853877.html	2024-11-06T09:21:21-08:00	
Taiwanese couple prosecuted for spreading China's propaganda	Washington — Judicial investigators in Taiwan have indicted a couple affiliated with a small political party on charges of receiving millions of dollars from Chinese authorities to promote the Chinese government’s political agenda and influence Taiwan’s elections and referendums. Taiwan’s Chiayi District Prosecutors’ Office said Monday it has charged Chang Meng-chung and his wife, Hung Wen-ting, with violating Taiwan’s Anti-Infiltration Act and election laws by making radio and digital media propaganda for Beijing in exchange for NT$74 million, approximately $2.32 million, paid out over more than a decade. Prosecutors allege China’s Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing and the TAO branch office in China’s Fujian Province paid the couple between 2011 and 2023 to promote candidates favored by Beijing, disparage Hong Kong democracy activists and members of the Falun Gong spiritual group, boast about China’s military power, and urge Taiwan’s troops to surrender in the event of China’s invasion. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary, and carries out frequent military drills around the self-governing island to assert its claim. Most Taiwanese oppose rejoining China. Chang and Hung are members of the China Unification Promotion Party, or CUPP, a small Taiwanese political party that Reuters reports has about 60,000 members and promotes Taiwan’s unification with the mainland. Prosecutors allege the couple went to mainland China many times to provide program summaries and plans for Chinese authorities’ review. In a response to the charges broadcast by multiple Taiwanese TV stations, Chang said, 'Taiwan says it's democratic, but it's not democratic at all. The CUPP has always been championing cross-strait reunification, so what I said is the same as what the CUPP has always advocated.' According to a report by Taiwan’s Central News Agency, if found guilty, the couple could face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to NT$10 million, roughly $313,400. Chao Fang-yi, a non-resident fellow at the Research Institute of Democracy, Security, and Emerging Technology in Taiwan, told VOA Mandarin that the use of the Anti-Infiltration Act, which came into effect in January 2020, was significant because authorities have struggled in the past to connect CUPP finances to China. 'Actually, if China wants to give them money, it may be in a very obscure way, and it may be difficult to trace it,' said Chao. 'So, this time, there is clear evidence so it can be prosecuted. I think it's also a pretty powerful thing.' Taiwan authorities have long sought to prosecute CUPP’s founder Chang An-lo, also known as the 'White Wolf,' who had links to organized crime. Chang was imprisoned for 10 years in the U.S. in the 1980s for drug trafficking and then lived in exile for 17 years in China before returning to the island in 2013 and turning himself in to authorities. But charges of organized crime were later dropped. Taiwanese police in 2018 raided Chang An-lo’s house and CUPP headquarters to look for evidence of funding from Beijing, which Chang denied. Charges that he violated a political donation law were dropped in July 2024, but Chang was sentenced to eight months in prison for forging documents and tax violations. In August, Taiwan’s High Prosecutors’ Office charged three Taiwanese affiliated with CUPP with developing a spy network to infiltrate the Taiwanese military. The Investigation Bureau of Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice said in its statement Monday that authorities investigating Chang Meng-chung and his wife searched 24 locations between December 2023 and July of this year. The bureau said it seized mobile phones, computers, financial records and other evidence. The bureau and prosecutor's office said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on the mainland has taken advantage of Taiwan's democratic freedoms to instruct, entrust or fund domestic collaborators to carry out infiltration and division and spread disinformation against Taiwan to manipulate and interfere in its elections and national security. VOA has not seen any comments on the arrests from China’s Taiwan Affairs Office of the CCP Central Committee or the Taiwan Affairs Office of China’s State Council, Bejing’s relevant authorities who speak on Taiwan issues, by the time of publication. Adrianna Zhang from VOA Mandarin Service contributed to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwanese-couple-prosecuted-for-spreading-china-s-propaganda/7853843.html	2024-11-06T08:31:21-08:00	
Arab leaders congratulate Trump but wonder if he can end Mideast wars as promised	AMMAN, JORDAN — Arab leaders quickly congratulated Donald Trump on his U.S. presidential election victory. Some are hopeful he could bring an end to conflicts raging in the Middle East while others are looking for a stronger stance against Iran. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, United Arab Emirates leaders, and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, all congratulated Donald Trump on his win, saying strengthening strategic partnerships is important. Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA that during the election, Trump emphasized personal ties with such leaders compared to what she called Biden’s more transactional approach. Khatib said Arab leaders want Trump to end war in Gaza and Lebanon. 'One of his main campaign promises was to end the war in Gaza. But end it how? Would it end with a Palestinian state? We don’t know,' she said. 'The thing that is worrying is [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu attacking Iran. This will be major. Handling Iran will not be easy for Trump.' Bin Salman has reiterated that his country would not consider improving ties with Israel unless the Gaza war ended and a Palestinian state is established. Wealthy Gulf states have bolstered ties with Iran and given the Islamic Republic assurances that they won't allow Israel to use their airspace to facilitate attacks on Iran. In its response to the elections, Iran played down the results, saying it was ready for confrontation with Israel. Jordan’s King Abdullah, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati, who are involved in trying to negotiate an end to the raging conflicts, also congratulated Trump. Analyst Osama Al Sharif in Amman said he believes Trump will pressure Netanyahu to end the conflicts before the presidential inauguration next year. 'He will boldly tell Netanyahu ... to wrap things up before the 20th of January because those two wars, especially Gaza, have become so toxic and they have become part of the [President Joe] Biden stigma, which was also eventually inflicted on [Vice President Kamala] Harris,' he said. 'Trump doesn’t need to start his first day at the office with more news of children getting killed and hospitals being blown up.' Al Sharif told VOA that Iran will be a big challenge for Trump, who he says is an 'isolationist who wants to extract America from any conflict.' He predicted Trump may tighten sanctions on Iran. 'More sanctions,' he said. 'He may be able to communicate with Tehran through [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, who is now a very close ally of the Iranians. That remains to be seen.' Al Sharif, however, expressed concern that Trump might recognize Israel’s annexation of most of the West Bank under Israel’s current hard right government, which he said 'would complicate things dramatically' for the Palestinians and Jordan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-leaders-congratulate-trump-but-wonder-if-he-can-end-mideast-wars-as-promised/7853829.html	2024-11-06T08:22:20-08:00

Republicans take control of US Senate; House still undecided	The Republican party won back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats in Tuesday’s election. Control of the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet decided early Wednesday. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives were at stake in elections throughout the United States for new two-year terms, while 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate were contested for new six-year terms. Before election day, Democrats had narrow control of the Senate and Republicans of the House. Key Republican victories for Senate seats in West Virginia and Ohio put them in position to be back in the majority. In the House, Republicans held a 220-212 edge, with three vacant seats going into the election. Control of that chamber has not been confirmed yet. Control of the House may not be known for several days, as California has often taken days to count ballots, and recounts and runoffs of close races can take weeks to resolve. Political surveys throughout the election campaign have shown voters — much like in the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump race for the White House — evenly divided in their political preference for congressional control. An October Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 43% of registered voters would back the Republican House candidate in their district, while 43% would back the Democratic candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-take-control-of-us-senate-house-still-undecided/7853721.html	2024-11-06T06:46:55-08:00

Russia paints doomsday portrayal of US elections	The FBI said more than 50 election sites across five battleground states received hoax bomb emails on Election Day in the U.S., and the emails in four of these states came from a Russian domain. None of the threats sent to polling sites in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona were deemed credible, and while causing a brief disruption, they did not affect the voting, the FBI said. 'We identified the source, and it was from Russia,' Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a news conference, adding that the Russians 'don’t want us to have free, fair and accurate elections, and if they could make us fight among ourselves, they could count that as a victory.' Russia denied involvement, claiming to 'never' have interfered in elections in the U.S. or elsewhere. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the Russian Embassy in the U.S. used similar language, calling the FBI allegations 'malicious slander.' That belies a well-documented decades-long history of Russian attempts to meddle in the domestic affairs of numerous nations across continents, including systematic efforts against the United States, ranging from malicious cyberattacks to multimillion-dollar disinformation campaigns. Just last week, German officials said Russia organized bomb threats targeting polling stations during the presidential elections in Moldova, where the Kremlin is accused of trying but failing to replace the pro-Western president, Maia Sandu, with a more amenable candidate. As it became clear that former U.S. President Donald Trump was poised to return to power, Russian officials and state media signaled their satisfaction with the result. Vice President Kalala Harris, the Democratic candidate, 'is finished,' former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev posted on social media platform X. 'The objectives of the Special Military Operation [Russia’s war in Ukraine] remain unchanged and will be achieved.' The Kremlin-owned Sputnik News branch in India posted on X a short AI-generated video showing a laughing Harris against a background of exploding bombs and destroyed towns in Ukraine. Harris is leaving behind a 'rich foreign policy legacy,' the post said. Russia-linked accounts shared posts saying goodbye to nearly all officials in the current U.S. administration, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, whom they called a 'butcher' for his support to Ukraine. Russia’s state-controlled news network RT [formerly Russia Today] published an election night story featuring its U.S. correspondent Valentin Bogdanov’s experience among Trump’s 'most loyal supporters' near his Mar-a-Largo residence in Florida. Bogdanov described the affairs in the U.S. as 'a deep people against a deep state,' and predicted a civil war in a 'dysfunctional state.' He painted a picture of a chaotic, fraudulent election with officials at polling sites in Michigan, Arizona and Maryland among other states faking technical issues to cast Trump votes for Harris. None of those claims proved credible. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency described the elections as 'free, fair and safe.' Russia’s meddling efforts are not limited to its alleged role in the hoax bomb threats on Election Day. On November 1, the Office of the Direction of National Intelligence, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint statement from the U.S. Intelligence Community stating that 'Russian influence actors' created a fake video falsely showing people claiming to be from Haiti voting illegally in various Georgia counties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-paints-a-doomsday-portrayal-of-us-elections-/7853612.html	2024-11-06T05:38:03-08:00	
Hanoi demands Beijing return detained Vietnamese fishermen, ramps up island-building	Ho Chi Minh City — Vietnam is taking a more outspoken and transparent approach in response to China’s recent detention of Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea, analysts tell VOA. Hanoi is also moving forward with the construction of a new airstrip on a reef in its exclusive economic zone to further assert its sovereignty and challenge Beijing’s claims. Late last week, deputy spokesperson for Vietnam's foreign affairs ministry Doan Khac Viet called on China to release the fishermen who were captured with their fishing vessels in waters surrounding the Paracel Islands. Vietnam did not specify when or how many fishermen were detained. 'Vietnam resolutely opposes China’s actions, and requests China to fully respect Vietnam’s rights over the Paracel Islands, release all illegally detained Vietnamese fishermen and vessels, compensate for damage, and stop and not repeat the harassment and illegal capture of Vietnamese vessels and fishermen,' Viet said during a news conference late last week on October 31. Viet did not say when or how many fishermen have been detained. However, Radio Free Asia quoted a Chinese think tank saying this week that Vietnamese fishermen have been in Chinese detention in the Paracel archipelago for more than six months. The Beijing-based South China Sea Probing Initiative, or SCSPI, said on the social media platform X that the fishermen 'were detained in April and May' for illegal fishing activities in the waters around the Paracels, RFA reported. 'There are always Vietnamese fishermen in waters that are sensitive,' Raymond Powell, a fellow at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, told VOA on Monday. 'We don't know really how many have been detained because Vietnam is not the most transparent of administrations.' China has disputed Vietnam’s description of what happened. Asked about the incident last Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, 'China urges the Vietnamese side to do more to ask their fishermen to stop being engaged in illegal activities in waters under China’s jurisdiction.' Known as Hoang Sa in Vietnamese, the Paracels have been under Chinese control since it occupied the islands in a violent conflict with Vietnam in 1974. China claims that most of the South China Sea is part of its territory, despite an international ruling to the contrary. Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said China's harassment of Vietnamese fishermen around the Paracels is common but Hanoi's recent response shows a new approach from Hanoi. 'I think this move is inspired by the ‘transparency initiative’ by the Philippines,' Giang told VOA on a November 5 call, referring to how the Philippines government under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been exposing China's aggression in the South China Sea. Hanoi must manage a delicate balancing act, squeezed between its powerful neighbor, Western allies, and showing its population, it is not kowtowing to China, Giang added. By taking a more transparent approach similar to the Philippines, Vietnam is allowing 'anyone who wants to know about the current situation in the South China Sea dispute to judge for themselves who is right and who is wrong,' Giang said. 'Vietnam has to play the game. Having this kind of transparency initiative is a part of the game.' Clashing at sea Vietnam hasn't been as outspoken regarding China's actions in the South China Sea since 2014, when China deployed an oil rig near the Paracel Islands, Giang said. The move led to anti-China protests in Vietnam and a monthslong standoff between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. Giang noticed Hanoi again taking a more public approach in early October when local media reported a 'brutal attack on fishermen from Quang Ngai province.' According to local outlet VnExpress, two Chinese ships surrounded a Vietnamese fishing vessel on September 29. About 40 people from the Chinese ships boarded the Vietnamese vessel and beat the fishermen with metal rods, breaking bones and leaving one man unconscious. The Vietnamese fishermen said their gear and fish catch weighing four tons were also stolen before they were allowed to return to land. A fisherman in his 30s from coastal Binh Thuan province described Chinese fishing vessels in that area are 'armed and aggressive.' 'The Chinese don’t seem afraid of us,' he told VOA in Vietnamese on November 4, asking to withhold his name due to the sensitivity of the topic. 'In fact, they behave as if the area belongs to their country.' The fishermen in Binh Thuan said one of his friends has 'been threatened by a Chinese boat' and another has had their vessel 'attacked' by a Chinese ship and their equipment stolen. On October 2, foreign ministry spokesperson Pham Thu Hang stated, 'Vietnam is extremely concerned, indignant and resolutely protests the brutal treatment by Chinese law enforcement forces of Vietnamese fishermen.' Powell of Stanford University, said that Hanoi is generally more tight-lipped when it comes to China's attacks on Vietnamese fishermen, but the recent beatings may have been impossible for Hanoi to ignore. 'They may just have reached their limit,' Powell told VOA over the phone on November 4. 'The injury to those fishermen was so bad that it really couldn't be contained.' New airstrip In addition to protesting China's treatment of Vietnamese fishermen, Hanoi has been building up artificial islands in the South China Sea. Satellite imagery shows its most recent effort is building an airstrip on Barque Canada reef, a rock near the within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone. Collin Koh Swee Lean, senior fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, told VOA on November 5 that the airstrip could be as long as 3,000 meters (1.86 miles). He noted that the airstrip is likely to be used for temporary stopovers, refueling aircraft, and potentially to store munitions and rearm during a crisis. The airstrip 'will allow the Vietnamese to have a much more persistent presence over the South China Sea,' Koh said. Powell said that Vietnam has used China's preoccupation with the Philippines in recent years to focus on island-building. 'China hasn't said very much about [Vietnam's island-building] perhaps because they've been so preoccupied with the Philippines,' Powell said. 'Vietnam is literally strengthening their military outposts.' Growing its military strength at sea is considered crucial for Hanoi as China's influence grows over neighboring Cambodia and Laos. Hanoi may also be concerned about the Philippines swinging to a more China-friendly leadership in its 2028 election. 'The Vietnamese realized that there is so much Chinese build-up in the neighborhood,' he said. 'Vietnam is trying to counter that with its own build-up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hanoi-demands-beijing-return-detained-vietnamese-fishermen-ramps-up-island-building/7853588.html	2024-11-06T04:55:23-08:00

Abortion rights advocates win in 7 states and clear way to overturn Missouri ban but lose in 3	Washington — Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of 'pregnancy outcomes' prevailed in New York. The results include firsts for the abortion landscape, which underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states. They also came in the same election that Republican Donald Trump won the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an insistence that it's an issue best left to the states. Still, the president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive action. In the meantime, Missouri is positioned to be the first state where a vote will undo a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with an amendment that would allow lawmakers to restrict abortions only past the point of a fetus' viability — usually considered after 21 weeks, although there's no exact defined time frame. But the ban, and other restrictive laws, are not automatically repealed. Advocates now have to ask courts to overturn laws to square with the new amendment. 'Today, Missourians made history and sent a clear message: decisions around pregnancy, including abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care are personal and private and should be left up to patients and their families, not politicians,' Rachel Sweet, campaign manager of Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said in a statement. Roughly half of Missouri's voters said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 2,200 of the state's voters. But only about 1 in 10 said abortion should be illegal in all cases; nearly 4 in 10 said abortion should be illegal in most cases. Bans remain in place in three states after votes Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota became the first states since Roe was overturned where abortion opponents prevailed on a ballot measure. Most voters supported the Florida measure, but it fell short of the required 60% to pass constitutional amendments in the state. Most states require a simple majority. The result was a political win for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who had steered state GOP funds to the cause. His administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the result is 'a momentous victory for life in Florida and for our entire country,' praising DeSantis for leading the charge against the measure. The defeat makes permanent a shift in the Southern abortion landscape that began when the state's six-week ban took effect in May. That removed Florida as a destination for abortion for many women from nearby states with deeper bans and also led to far more women from the state traveling to obtain abortion. The nearest states with looser restrictions are North Carolina and Virginia — hundreds of miles away. 'The reality is because of Florida's constitution a minority of Florida voters have decided Amendment 4 will not be adopted,' said Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for the Yes on 4 Campaign said while wiping away tears. 'The reality is a majority of Floridians just voted to end Florida's abortion ban.' In South Dakota, another state with a ban on abortion throughout pregnancy with some exceptions, the defeat of an abortion measure was more decisive. It would have allowed some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups did not support it. Voters in Nebraska adopted a measure that allows more abortion restrictions and enshrines the state's current 12-week ban and rejected a competing measure that would have ensured abortion rights. Other states guaranteed abortion rights Arizona's amendment will mean replacing the current law that bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. The new measure ensures abortion access until viability. A ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced. In Maryland, the abortion rights amendment is a legal change that won't make an immediate difference to abortion access in a state that already allows it. It's a similar situation in Missouri, where abortion is already legal until viability. The Colorado measure exceeded the 55% of support required to pass. Besides enshrining access, it also undoes an earlier amendment that barred using state and local government funding for abortion, opening the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance plans covering care. A New York equal rights law that abortion rights group say will bolster abortion rights also passed. It doesn't contain the word 'abortion' but rather bans discrimination on the basis of 'pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.' Sasha Ahuja, campaign director of New Yorkers for Equal Rights, called the result 'a monumental victory for all New Yorkers' and a vote against opponents who she says used misleading parental rights and anti-trans messages to thwart the measure. The results end a win streak for abortion-rights advocates Until Tuesday, abortion rights advocates had prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared on statewide ballots since the fall of Roe. The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy — before women often realize they're pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans. The issue is resonating with voters. About one-fourth said abortion policy was the single most important factor for their vote, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. Close to half said it was an important factor, but not the most important. Just over 1 in 10 said it was a minor factor. The outcomes of ballot initiatives that sought to overturn strict abortion bans in Florida and Missouri were very important to a majority of voters in the states. More than half of Florida voters identified the result of the amendment as very important, while roughly 6 in 10 of Missouri's voters said the same, the survey found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortion-rights-advocates-win-in-7-states-and-clear-way-to-overturn-missouri-ban-but-lose-in-3/7853556.html	2024-11-06T03:56:12-08:00	
Ukraine reports destroying 38 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 38 of the 63 aerial drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The Ukrainian air force said it intercepted the drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zhytomyr and Zaporizhzhia regions. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said on Telegram that Russia’s attack damaged energy infrastructure, but did not hurt anyone. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Kursk region and another drone over Oryol. Russian officials said there were no reports of damage or casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that his country’s forces have engaged in battle with the North Korean troops that were deployed to Russia to assist in its war on Ukraine. 'The first battles with North Korean soldiers open a new page of instability in the world,' Zelenskyy said Tuesday in his daily address — his first official acknowledgement of the encounter between the two forces. Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s defense minister, has also confirmed the arrival of the North Korean forces. In an interview with South Korea’s public broadcaster KBS, he said the Ukrainian and North Korean forces have engaged in 'small-scale' fighting. 'The first North Korean troops have already been shelled in the Kursk region,' said Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. According to a U.S. official quoted by The New York Times late Tuesday, a 'significant number' of North Korean troops had been killed, though the report said it was not clear when the fighting had occurred. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse, Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-destroying-38-russian-drones/7853502.html	2024-11-06T02:59:01-08:00	
World leaders congratulate Trump on expected election win	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — World leaders offered congratulations to Donald Trump after news media projections showed he was on path to securing a decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Trump appeared likely to defeat his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, marking a historical political comeback for the former Republican president following four years out of office. VOA has not yet projected a winner in the race. Early Wednesday, many world leaders took to the social media website X to congratulate Trump, whose unpredictable 'America First' foreign policy approach complicated relations with many U.S. allies and foes alike during his first term in office. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first U.S. allies to send a message of support, praising Trump’s 'historic return,' which he said offers a 'powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has called for more U.S. and Western support to fight off Russia’s invasion, spoke positively of what he said was Trump’s commitment to 'peace through strength' in world affairs. 'This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,' said Zelenskyy. The head of NATO — the Western military alliance that Trump has long criticized for not doing enough to take care of Europe’s defense — made similar comments in his congratulatory message for Trump. 'His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO,' said Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary-general. French President Emmanuel Macron also quickly offered congratulations, saying he is 'ready to work together as we did for four years … with your conviction and mine.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government stands 'shoulder to shoulder' in defense of shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. 'From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the U.K.-U.S. special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,' Starmer said. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said she 'warmly congratulate[s]' Trump and praised the 'true partnership' between the European Union and the United States. During Trump's first term, friction erupted between the EU and the U.S., partly over Trump's imposition of tariffs on European exports. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, a conservative Trump ally, called Trump's victory the 'biggest comeback in U.S. political history' and said it was a 'much-needed victory' for the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not commented on the U.S. election results. But on X, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev relished the apparent defeat of Harris, saying 'Kamala is finished ... let her keep cackling infectiously.' Asian leaders also began sending congratulatory messages. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, 'Australians and Americans are great friends and true allies.' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered the 'heartiest congratulations' to Trump, who he called his friend. 'As you build on your successes of the previous term, I look forward to reviewing our collaboration to further strengthen' the U.S.-India relationship, Modi said. In a statement, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed hope that the 'unshakeable alliance' between Washington and Manila, 'will be a force of good that will blaze a path of prosperity and amity, in the region, and in both sides of the Pacific.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-leaders-congratulate-trump-on-expected-election-win/7853474.html	2024-11-06T02:24:04-08:00

Germany's awkward coalition faces make-or-break moment	berlin — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition faces a make-or-break moment on Wednesday as leaders of the three parties convene to forge compromises between their differing visions on rescuing the economy from decline. Relations between Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and free-market Free Democrats (FDP) have sunk to new lows over the past week as they aired their respective strategies without consulting one another. The FDP, long the odd-one-out in the ideologically mismatched and fractious coalition, has doubled down on its ultimatum: that some key deals must be reached in what the party has called an 'autumn of decisions,' or the coalition is finished. 'We need a real change in direction,' FDP parliamentary chief Christian Duerr said on Tuesday. Scholz, Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the FDP and Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens are set to hold two crisis meetings on Wednesday, in addition to attending a cabinet meeting with a packed agenda. Then they will join a broader gathering of parliamentary and party leaders from the three camps at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) that could extend into the night. The chancellor and his two top ministers hope to reach a preliminary agreement on how to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole in the budget and forge a compromise on economic policies that they can present to their respective parties. 'It's clear it is possible,' Scholz told reporters on Tuesday. A coalition collapse could leave Scholz heading a minority government and relying on ad hoc parliamentary majorities to govern, or trigger an early election - which surveys suggest would be disastrous for all three coalition parties. The SPD and Greens are polling well below their scores in the 2021 election, while the FDP could be ejected from parliament altogether. The three parties are at odds over how best to rescue Europe's largest economy, which is now facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its business model after the end of cheap Russian gas and amid increasing competition from China. The FDP has proposed public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to this malaise. It also wants to slow down Germany's shift to a carbon-neutral economy. The SPD and the Greens, meanwhile, while at odds on a host of other issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed. Still, Habeck made a major concession towards the FDP on Monday, saying the funds earmarked as subsidies for a new Intel chip factory could now be used to plug the hole in the budget.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-awkward-coalition-faces-make-or-break-moment/7853400.html	2024-11-05T23:47:22-08:00	
Afghan opium cultivation bounces and shifts 2 years after ban, UN says	VIENNA — Opium poppy production in Afghanistan, long the world's dominant supplier of the raw material for heroin, has risen by a fifth in the second full year since the Taliban banned it but remains a fraction of pre-ban levels, a U.N. report said on Wednesday. The Taliban's supreme spiritual leader banned the cultivation of narcotics in April 2022. That prompted opium farming in the country to plummet an estimated 95% in 2023, according to an annual survey by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). This year, cultivation increased an estimated 19% to 12,800 hectares and the center of production shifted from its traditional heartland, the country's southwest, to the northeast, according to the latest UNODC report published Tuesday. 'Despite the increase in 2024, opium poppy cultivation remains far below 2022, when an estimated 232,000 hectares were cultivated,' the UNODC said in a statement. Dry opium prices stabilized around $730 a kilogram in the first half of this year, far above the pre-ban average of $100, the report said. Last year's report said that in August 2023 those farm-gate prices had reached a '20-year peak' of $408. In Afghanistan's southwestern region, which borders Pakistan and accounted for almost half the country's production in 2023, cultivation collapsed 65% this year, the report said. Of that region's poppy-farming provinces, the only exception was Helmand, which saw a 434% increase but from a low base. In the northeastern region, which borders Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, cultivation surged 381% this year to 7,563 hectares, four times the area cultivated in the southwest, the second-biggest producer, the report said. Almost all the northeast's production was in one province, Badakhshan, a mountainous area that includes a stretch of the Hindu Kush and Afghanistan's relatively short border with China. 'The high prices and dwindling opium stocks may encourage farmers to flout the ban, particularly in areas outside of traditional cultivation centers, including neighboring countries,' the UNODC said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-opium-cultivation-bounces-and-shifts-2-years-after-ban-un-says/7853395.html	2024-11-05T23:40:00-08:00	
Trump claims victory in address to supporters as his electoral vote count grows	U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump waited Wednesday to find out which one of them will be the country’s next president, as election officials in several key states worked to complete the vote count in what has been a tight presidential race. In the U.S. system where the presidential election is tallied in a series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the direction of the winner. Several of those closely watched states remained uncalled early Wednesday, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania. Trump won Georgia and North Carolina. A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would speak later Wednesday. The state-by-state electoral system includes different rules for how and when votes are counted, adding to the complexity of how results are reported. In some states, ballots that are cast in-person before election day, or by mail, were allowed to be counted as they came in, leading to faster results. But in some states, those counts did not begin until polls closed Tuesday night, while some states also allowed ballots to be put in the mail as late as Tuesday, meaning final results in those areas will not come for days. In the last election, in 2020, President Joe Biden was not declared the winner until four days after Election Day, when the results for the state of Pennsylvania gave him more than the 270 electoral votes (out of 538) necessary for victory. 'Pennsylvania could take as much as a week. But it may or may not be the decisive state,' Elaine Kamarck, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. 'If she (Harris) picks up North Carolina, for instance, then it may not matter so much. And North Carolina and Nevada, it may not matter that much. So, it kind of depends on what happens in the rest of the night as to how long we'll have to wait to see if a president is elected.' In Congress, the Republican Party took control of the Senate. Despite a few races still too close to call, the Republicans took a 51-seat advantage in the 100-member chamber late Tuesday. There were still too many races to know which party would control the U.S. House. Looming over the eventual result was the prospect of legal challenges. Both the Trump and Harris campaigns were ready with legal experts to contest any irregularities they saw. A Harris win would make her the country’s first female president. A Trump victory would make him the first U.S. leader since Grover Cleveland in the 1880s to serve non-consecutive terms. The next president is set to be inaugurated for their four-year term on January 20. A key foreign policy focus in either a Trump or Harris administration will be relations between the United States and China, including subjects such as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea. Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi University, told VOA Mandarin that China would approach the prospective presidents differently, including being potentially more aggressive toward the United States if Harris wins. 'China may create some events to give her (Harris) a show of force,' Wang said. 'After all, the United States is tied up with wars in the Ukraine, and in Israel and Gaza. In the Taiwan Strait, China has already carried out so-called gray area strategy on a daily basis. I think China may expand its gray area strategy closer to Taiwan as a way to a test Harris.' 'If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn't go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up today, he might say he's going to raise tariffs by 200%. If he wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a little bit more restrained.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-wait-as-key-states-count-presidential-election-vote/7853394.html	2024-11-05T23:32:02-08:00	
Iran uses open and covert methods to sway US voters	Foreign adversaries used increasingly sophisticated meddling operations to target the November 5 U.S. presidential race between Democratic party candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and her Republican party opponent, former President Donald Trump. Iran has sought to influence and interfere with the results of the poll by promoting disinformation narratives favorable to its own foreign policy goals. The societal division in the U.S. and predictions of 'post-election unrest,' as well as depictions of the United States’ support for Israel in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war as Americans’ historic 'support for genocide,' dominated the Iranian state-controlled media coverage of the U.S. elections. An Iran-operated network of social media accounts and fake news sites targeted U.S. voters on opposite ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging. In the days before the election, Press TV, a state-owned English language outlet, has run analyses and news items depicting the United States as a 'defunct' nation, which the presidential elections only amplified. 'As America heads to the polls, the only certainty seems to be that division, disunity, dissatisfaction and maybe even disfunction aren’t going away anytime soon,' Press TV analyst Ramin Mazaheri said in a November 4 report that exemplifies the overall coverage. Iran has long accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel says it is Iran who is responsible for the violence in Gaza and Lebanon, citing Tehran’s decades-long effort to destroy Israel via proxy forces. Tehran-based commentator Alireza Akbar wrote for Press TV that in supporting Israel, both Harris and Trump are no exception from their predecessors and that 'US presidents have always been on the side of genocide, massacres and holocausts.' Speaking with Press TV in October, U.S. academic and Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Rectenwald likewise said '[b]oth Harris and Trump will continue to support Israel's psychopathic genocidal rampages.' Press TV has repeatedly promoted the narrative that Harris’ support for Israel could cost her the election among Muslim voters, and repeated claims she is responsible for civilian deaths in the Gaza Strip. In one November 4 report, Press TV correspondent Mazaheri said that 'Vice President Kamala Harris’ participation in the Gaza genocide has shocked voters of all types,' adding 'polls show Muslim Americans are capable of tipping the balance.' The Israel-Hamas war, and its impact on civilians in the Gaza Strip, is a key issue for Arab and Muslim American voters, particularly in Michigan, a key swing state. During a rally in Michigan on Sunday, Harris vowed to do 'everything in her power' to stop the Israel-Hamas war if elected president. Sources told The Times of Israel in late October that Trump wanted the war in Gaza to conclude before he returns to office if he wins the election. Researchers at Microsoft found disinformation narratives similar to those on Press TV being amplified by covert news sites and social media accounts. Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) reported on October 23, that its researchers discovered an 'Iranian operated cyber persona' called 'Bushnell’s Men,' named after Aaron Bushnell, who died after setting himself on fire outside Israel’s embassy in Washington, D.C., in February. Microsoft reported ‘’Bushnell’s Men’’ attempted to foment anti-Israeli protests in the United States and Europe, and had called on call on Americans to 'sit out the elections.' Microsoft also reported that 'four websites masquerading as news outlets are actively engaging US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.' One of those websites with a left-leaning bent, called Nio Thinker, published an article criticizing the 'democratic party’s deafening silence on Palestine,' Al Monitor reported. While Harris features prominently in more recent Press TV reports, U.S. intelligence agencies and the Microsoft researchers earlier documented how Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have sought to undermine the campaign of Trump in this and previous elections. That included what the Department of the Treasury in September called Iranian state-sponsored 'spear-phishing' and 'hack-and-leak operations' intended to 'undermine confidence in the United States’ election processes and institutions and to interfere with political campaigns.' A September New York Times report found that Iran’s targeting of President Joe Biden and Harris along with Trump may reflect 'a wider goal of sowing internal discord and discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the eyes of the world.' That report cited two Iranian officials who said Tehran was 'unconcerned' over who won the presidential race, claiming 'Washington's animosity transcends either political party.' In July, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warned that Iran 'is seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions,' and 'opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests regarding the war in Gaza.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-uses-open-and-covert-methods-to-sway-us-voters/7853386.html	2024-11-05T23:13:51-08:00	
US Navy contractor behind one of the military's biggest scandals sentenced to 15 years	SAN DIEGO — Former military defense contractor Leonard 'Fat Leonard' Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in 'ill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,' the statement said. Prosecutors said the sentence resulted from Francis' first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022. Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Francis cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023. Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery and fraud charges, plus 16 months for failing to appear. The sentences are to be served consecutively. 'Leonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,' U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday’s statement. 'The impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.' Email and phone messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for William Douglas Sprague, an attorney for Francis. Sprague, who sought a sentence of just under nine years, argued that his client’s cooperation should warrant a lesser sentence, 10 News San Diego reported. Sprague also said Francis' company provided the Navy with exemplary services for many years. 'Unfortunately, as Leonard acknowledged in his early guilty plea and immediate cooperation, his greed drove him to commit bribery and to commit fraud,' Sprague said. Prosecutors said Francis’ actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges. An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family’s ship-servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines. In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company. In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison. While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards. But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela. He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance — caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia. The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny. The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each. Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the officers' case committed 'flagrant misconduct' by withholding information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-contractor-behind-one-of-the-military-s-biggest-scandals-sentenced-to-15-years-/7853359.html	2024-11-05T22:03:38-08:00

Indonesia to permanently relocate thousands of residents after volcanic eruptions	JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government plans to permanently relocate thousands of residents after a series of eruptions of Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano which killed nine people and damaged thousands of houses, officials said. Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki, located on Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara province, erupted on Sunday night, followed by smaller eruptions on Monday and Tuesday, and remains on the highest volcanic alert status. Permanent relocation is considered as 'long-term mitigation measures' to anticipate similar eruption in the future, said Suharyanto, the head of Indonesia's disaster agency in a statement on Wednesday. The government aims to relocate all residents living within a 7-kilometer radius from the crater, he added. There are more than 16,000 residents living in the nearest villages from the volcano, but the government is still calculating how many residents will be permanently relocated. As of Wednesday morning, at least 2,500 people had been evacuated, said Heronimus Lamawuran, spokesperson of East Flores regional government. The government will also build houses for the relocation, said Suharyanto without giving further detail. 'The volcano cannot be moved so it is the people who must move to safer locations,' Suharyanto said. The local government has declared a state of emergency for the next 57 days and prohibited any activity within 7 kilometers from the crater. Indonesia's volcanology agency on Tuesday raised the status of another volcano located in East Nusa Tenggara province, around 200 kilometers from Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki, to the second-highest level due to its 'rising' volcanic activity, although no eruption has been recorded as of Wednesday morning. Hadi Wijaya, the spokesperson for the volcanology agency, said the rising activity of Mount Iya had no correlation with eruptions of Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki. Indonesia straddles the so-called 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' an area of high seismic activity where multiple tectonic plates meet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-permanently-relocate-thousands-of-residents-after-volcanic-eruptions/7853324.html	2024-11-05T20:54:56-08:00

VOA talks with US presidential 3rd party candidates	Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have spent the past few months battling for the White House, and experts say that votes for third party candidates could be a deciding factor for who will become the next president of the United States. With the latest polls showing Harris and Trump in a dead heat in battleground states around the country, ballots cast for third-party candidates Jill Stein of the Green Party, independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver could be enough to tip the scales. VOA Persian spoke with all three of them. Their responses have been edited for length and clarity. Green Party candidate Jill Stein VOA: During one of his final campaign rallies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump praised you, saying he loved the Green Party and that you might be one of his favorite politicians. What do you make of this? Jill Stein: I make of that about as much as I make of Donald Trump's assessment of climate change, which is that he sort of believes the opposite of reality. I am in this race to provide an alternative to the two parties that are bought and paid for, that are serving Wall Street and the war contractors and definitely not the American people. So I don't have a lot of high regard for Donald Trump's political strategies or his values. VOA: How much support do you expect to receive in battleground states like Michigan? There were some polls that suggested you have support of over 40% of the Arab American population there. Stein: Exactly what the numbers will turn out to be, it depends how many people are turning out to vote. It depends how strong the vote of the, not only the Muslim population, but also many African Americans and Hispanics and young people who feel like they do not have a future under Kamala Harris, and they do not have a future under Donald Trump. At this point, it's too soon to say. We ourselves do not strictly work based on polls. We're really in this based on principle and for the long haul. We would be delighted if we make the 5% cut in the national poll in the national results, but it's very hard to say at this point. VOA: What would be your position regarding the government of Iran? Stein: I think we need to open the door to negotiations with Iran. Iran has elected a new president who is said to be moderate and interested in improving relations with the West, and we need to explore that. I think the most critical thing in the Middle East right now is resolving this expanding war and the intention of Bibi [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to create a wider war and drag the U.S. into it. I think that is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East right now and has the potential to grow into a conflict that's even bigger than the Middle East. Independent candidate Cornel West VOA: How many states allowed you to have your name on the ballot and why did others not? Cornel West: We've got 16 states where we have direct ballot access. We have 24 states where we have write-in access, and that did require petitions and signatures. So that required a lot of work on behalf of magnificent volunteers. But it was very difficult. There's been a tremendous struggle, but we come up swinging. VOA: How different will your policy be compared to what we hear from Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump? West: Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, militarism, racism, poverty and materialism are the four forces that are sucking the democratic energy out of the American social experiment. I take very seriously his critique of militarism. I see that as a criticism of American foreign policies in which we are so eager to create these lethal armed forces rather than engage in wise diplomatic processes. And so there would be no genocide. I would have had an embargo on any kind of military or financial support of Israel as it was very clear that they were laying bare this kind of massive massacre on innocent people, especially innocent children and women and men. The same would be true in terms of being able to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Same would be true in terms of trying to be more diplomatic with China. I see Kamala Harris as a militarist, Black woman. That is to say she's willing to not just provoke, but to push [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. And I think Putin himself is still very much a gangster and a war criminal in his own way, but he has a right — Russia has a right to security. And the same is true with China. There's too much provocation, and I think that moves us toward World War III in the same way that Trump moves us towards Civil War II at home. And that was one reason why I wanted to provide some kind of alternative to Trump and [U.S. President Joe] Biden. And then when Biden had his LBJ moment [referring to Biden's poor debate performance] something that we talked about many, many months ago, we just predicted that Harris now is following through on the same militarism in Gaza. And of course, genocide, the crime of genocide, is a litmus test of morality of any nation, any country, and if you deny it, if you enable it, it's a sign that you don't have a moral fiber in your military policy. VOA: Many people in the occupied West Bank are disturbed by Tehran's support for militants in Gaza. How do you see this considering the moral aspects of your vision, your doctrine and your policy? West: Malcolm X used to say, I'm for truth, no matter who's for it, and justice, no matter who supports it. People can actually support just movements for motivations that themselves are highly suspicious. When the French supported the American revolutionaries, when Lafayette came to the United States, it was partly because the French were over against the British in Europe, they didn't have a whole lot of solidarity with these colonists responding against the British Empire. ... The Soviet Union supported the freedom struggles in Africa. It wasn't always because they just love Africans so much. It was anti-United States. They had a Cold War going on, and their policies were strategic and tactical in that way. The same would be true for Iran vis-a-vis Palestinians. So I think we have to be very truthful about the ways in which the motives might not always be attractive, but when you're a people like Palestinians this moment, whose backs are against the wall, they need help from anybody, and it's very important that people highlight their plight so that their babies are not crushed. But that doesn't mean that those who are supporting them always have the right motives, and therefore we can still be critical of what those motives are. Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver VOA: In your platform, you mentioned that Libertarians seek the United States at peace with the world. How different will your foreign policy be? Chase Oliver: It would be a drastic difference than what the status quo has been, certainly since I've been an adult. Since I've been an adult, let's just call it the post-9/11 War on Terror kind of foreign policy mindset that we've had, which I think is rooted in ideas that are very black and white. You're either with us or you're with the terrorists. The best way to solve a problem is through a preemptive war or through increasing our military presence in the region, to flex our muscle. And what I think that has done is actually created further instability, particularly in the Middle East, which I don't think has been a success despite the trillions of dollars we've spent in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't think you can say either of those nations are particularly bastions of democracy, or that the region itself is now more stable than it was. And so for me, I would say let's remove our military footprint and start flexing our diplomatic muscle. Let's start meeting with world leaders directly, one on one. Let's start forming coalitions around peaceful ideas and free trade and voluntary exchange to tear down barriers between our nations so that we can have cultural exchanges with one another. I think these are the ideas that we really need to be pushing, and not a militarized foreign policy that's ruined the idea that the United States must be the world's enforcer. VOA: So you don't see America as the leader of the free world with its responsibilities? Oliver: I absolutely see America as a leader in terms of the markets of the world, the economic engine of the world, the diplomatic arm of the world. But it doesn't need to be coming, using the military might of the world. Teddy Roosevelt said, 'Speak softly and carry a big stick.' We have a very powerful military that can defend ourselves, and ultimately, if there were a need and if Congress declared a war, fight a war anywhere in the world with absolute certainty that we could dominate our opponent. But you don't flex your muscle like that around the world. That's not a position of strength. When you use that military might to push your agenda, that's actually a position of weakness, because good ideas should not require force, and you should be able to diplomatically work throughout the world. And I recognize the world is not perfect. The world does not lack violence. The world is not lacking for bad people, particularly governments around the world who represent good people. And Iran is no different. The government of Iran is abhorrent. They're abusive to their people. They curtail their rights. But the people of Iran are good, innocent people who don't deserve to have things like airstrikes and missiles raining down upon them because of the evils of their government. And I hope that ultimately, we can liberalize the world more towards more liberalized things like free speech, freedom of movement and freedom of religion. But that's not going to come just from us beating people down. VOA: How difficult is it to run as a third-party candidate? Oliver: Running as an alternative party candidate has a lot of challenges because the two mainstream parties have a lot of built-in incumbency power, both in the number of elected officials they have as well as things like taxpayer-funded primaries. So they basically take taxes out of my wallet to fund primaries that help promote the candidates that are Republicans and Democrats. And as a Libertarian, we're kind of left in the lurch there. So there's a lot of challenges, especially around things like ballot access. There's a lot of solutions. And actually a big part of my platform is a thing called the voter bill of rights that will open up this process, not just for Libertarians like myself, but all sorts of other alternative parties that really need to have their voices heard.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-talks-with-us-presidential-3rd-party-candidates-/7852852.html	2024-11-05T16:09:08-08:00	
US Army soldier injured while working on Gaza pier has died	washington — A U.S. Army soldier who was injured in May while working on the American-built pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has died. Sargeant Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier, causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members also were injured but later returned to duty. U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last Thursday and had been assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. 'Sergeant Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first-line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. We will continue to provide support to his family during this difficult time,' said Colonel John 'Eddie' Gray, brigade commander. 'Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.' Captain Shkeila Milford-Glover, spokesperson for the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Stanley had recently retired and was receiving treatment in a long-term care medical center. The massive pier project was hampered by unexpected bad weather and security issues, as well as persistent safety issues involving Israeli forces that prompted aid agencies to halt distribution of the supplies out of fear of being injured and killed. The Defense Department formally pulled the pier from the Gaza shore on June 28 and declared an end in mid-July to the mission to bring aid into the territory besieged by the war between Israel and Hamas. The military moved nearly 20 million pounds of aid onto the Gaza shore in what officials said was the 'largest volume of humanitarian assistance' ever delivered into the Middle East. But aid agencies had difficulty moving the food brought ashore to areas farther into Gaza where it was needed most because humanitarian convoys came under attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-army-soldier-injured-while-working-on-gaza-pier-has-died-/7852796.html	2024-11-05T15:06:56-08:00	
Police fire tear gas at protests of deadly canopy collapse in Serbia	NOVI SAD, Serbia — Protesters threw flares and red paint Tuesday on the City Hall building in the Serbian city of Novi Sad in rage over last week's collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station that killed 14 people. Police responded by firing tear gas canisters. The protesters surrounded the building in central Novi Sad, breaking windows and throwing stones and other objects despite calls by organizers to remain calm. Special police troops were deployed inside the building. Some of the angry protesters wearing masks, believed to be soccer hooligans who are close to the populist government, tried to get inside the building and hand over their demands that those responsible for the canopy collapse face justice. Serbia's autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said the police are 'showing restraint,' but also issued a warning saying 'horrific, violent protests are underway.' 'People of Serbia, please do not think violence is allowed,' he said on X, formerly Twitter. 'All those taking part in the incidents will be punished.' Protest organizers said they wanted to enter the Hall and submit their demands. Miran Pogacar, an opposition activist, said 'one glass window can be mended but we cannot bring back 14 lives. People are angry. Serbia won’t stand for this.' Bojan Pajtic, an opposition politician, said he believed the violent incidents were stoked deliberately by provocateurs, a tactic used before in Serbia to derail peaceful anti-government protests and paint the opposition protesters as enemies of the nation. Thousands first marched through the city streets demanding that top officials step down because of the fatal outer roof collapse last Friday, including President Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic. The protesters first gathered outside the railway station where they held a moment of silence for the victims as organizers read their names. The crowd responded by chanting: 'arrest the gang' and 'thieves.' The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister — a message that they have blood on their hands. The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president. 'Our Serbian tricolor has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,' Vucic wrote on X. 'Tonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.' Critics of Serbia’s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies. The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia’s construction minister submitted his resignation Tuesday. Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Opposition parties behind Tuesday’s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved. The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition Tuesday. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-fire-tear-gas-at-protests-of-deadly-canopy-collapse-in-serbia/7852830.html	2024-11-05T14:35:07-08:00	
Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico	A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off on Tuesday from southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S. voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages such as 'NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD' and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to Reuters witnesses. 'We want U.S. authorities to see us, to see that we are people who want to work, not to harm anyone,' said Honduran migrant Roy Murillo, who joined the caravan with his two children and his pregnant wife. In recent years, several caravans with people hoping to enter the United States have attempted to reach the U.S.-Mexican border, traveling in mass groups for safety. Most have dispersed along the way. 'I'm afraid to travel alone with my family. Here, the cartels either kidnap you or kill you. ... That's why we're coming in the caravan,' Murillo said. Murillo recounted his unsuccessful attempts to secure an asylum appointment through a mobile app developed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. Tapachula, a mandatory crossing point for tens of thousands of migrants, has become one of Mexico's most violent cities in recent months, with migrants frequently targeted by organized crime, according to official data. 'I feel suffocated here. That's why we decided to leave,' said 28-year-old Venezuelan migrant Thais, who spoke on condition that her surname not be used due to safety concerns. She joined the caravan with her husband and 3-year-old daughter. 'I wish Mr. Trump and Ms. Kamala would see that we are human beings, that we want to live and support our families,' she added. Voters cast ballots on Tuesday in the race between Vice President Harris, a Democrat seeking to become the first female U.S. president, and Trump, a Republican immigration hard-liner aiming to regain the presidency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-caravan-of-3-000-heads-north-in-mexico/7852819.html	2024-11-05T14:19:54-08:00	
Swedish court sentences far-right politician for insulting Muslims	MALMO, Sweden — A Swedish court sentenced a far-right politician Tuesday to four months in jail for two counts of 'incitement against an ethnic group' after making hateful comments at political rallies two years ago. The Danish-Swedish 42-year-old man, who was not named but has been identified by Swedish media as Rasmus Paludan, founder and head of the Danish nationalist anti-immigration party Stram Kurs, had been previously convicted and sentenced by a Danish court on a similar charge, the Malmo District Court said. In 2022, Paludan made his offensive remarks directed at Muslims, Arabs and Africans during protests that he led in the southern city of Malmo, the court said. He also burned a copy of the Quran, Islam's holy book, on at least one occasion. In response, a violent wave of riots swept the country. Some observers also say Paludan's actions may have momentarily risked Sweden's chances of joining NATO after increasing political tensions with Turkey. Sweden joined the alliance in March this year. The court in a statement Tuesday said Paludan's remarks against Muslims 'cannot be excused as criticism of Islam or as political campaign work.' Chief Councilor Nicklas Soderberg, the court's chairman, said: 'It is permitted to publicly make critical statements about, for example, Islam and also Muslims, but the disrespect of a group of people must not clearly cross the line for a factual and valid discussion.' He added that during the Malmo rallies in April and September 2022, 'there was no question of any such discussion,' and that Paludan's public statements 'only amounted to insulting Muslims.' The court took particular interest in whether the politician knew the protests were filmed and published on Facebook. Paludan had said that he wasn't aware of it, but the district court disagreed and said his 'actions at the gatherings would be downright illogical if he didn't know about the publication on Facebook.' Paludan, a lawyer by profession, told Swedish media outlets that he wasn't surprised by the verdict. 'It was expected. We will appeal,' the Swedish newspaper Expressen cited him as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-court-sentences-far-right-politician-for-insulting-muslims/7852800.html	2024-11-05T14:03:12-08:00	
US Department of Agriculture bans school lunch fees for low-income families	The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027. School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge 'processing fees' for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The Agriculture Department's new policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four. 'USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,' said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. 'While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.' The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report. The USDA has mandated since 2017 that school districts inform families of their options, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. 'It's just massively inconvenient,' said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch accounts, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. 'A dollar here and there, I expected,' she said. 'But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.' Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37, or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account. While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures 'may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.' Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, 'families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,' the agency said, 'including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-department-of-agriculture-bans-school-lunch-fees-for-low-income-families/7852801.html	2024-11-05T14:01:54-08:00	
Report: Russia deceives OPEC on oil sales to fund Ukraine war	LONDON — Russia is 'flagrantly violating' its agreements with the OPEC oil cartel by concealing the true amount of oil it is producing and selling, according to a new report that says the profits are funding Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The investigation by the Ukrainian Center for Defense Reforms asserts that Russia is breaching an OPEC agreement to cut oil production. The think tank is chaired by Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former chief adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister. Oil cut 'In 2016, amid declining oil prices and to stabilize the market, OPEC reached an agreement with ten additional oil-producing countries, including Russia. The participants in this expanded format, known as OPEC+, agreed to reduce oil production, leading to a natural rise in global commodity prices,' the report says. However, the authors say that Russia has 'flagrantly violated its obligations under the OPEC+ agreement' by concealing the true extent of its production and sales, thereby exceeding its production quota 'by no less than 2.57 million barrels per day (28%) on average during the first four months of 2024.' $60 billion That has enriched the Kremlin, said report co-author Danylyuk. 'It’s about $60 billion per year. And it's also important because this is the money which is not seen by anyone,' Danylyuk told VOA. 'And obviously, this is extra funds Russia can use to support the war efforts in Ukraine. This is actually the money they can use to buy microelectronics, to buy explosives, to buy shells, to pay countries like North Korea and Iran.' The report claims Russia is concealing the true volume of oil sold to its two biggest customers, India and China. 'To disguise these deliveries, Russian authorities list zero value for certain contracts in the customs declarations,' says the report. 'Over the first four months of 2024, Russia exported at least 789,000 barrels of oil per day more to China than officially reported. During the same period, exports to India exceeded official statistics by at least 280,000 barrels per day.' Shadow fleet In addition, Moscow is using a so-called shadow fleet of tankers to mask the true scale of its oil sales. The vessels 'frequently change flags or ownership structures, deliberately deactivate the Automatic Identification System, falsify location under the influence of electronic warfare, and use other deceptive shipping practices.' By comparing discrepancies in shipping data, the Center for Defense Reforms estimates that Russia is exporting an unaccounted crude oil volume of around 1.5 million barrels per day above its OPEC quota through the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. Smuggling 'Paradoxically, because Russia started using those sophisticated methods of smuggling its oil, they are able not just to fool the West and to hide the oil supplies from sanctions, but also to hide them from their partners in the OPEC+ club,' Danylyuk said. 'The real scale of the operations is actually much higher than most observers believe — $60 billion literally stolen from other OPEC+ countries,' he added. 'I don't think that OPEC originally was founded to have members like that, right? So it's not fair. It's not how cartels usually work.' Russia response Russia has not directly addressed accusations that it conceals oil sales from OPEC. The Kremlin had not responded to VOA requests for comment at the time of publication. Speaking at September’s Russian Energy Week forum in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin insisted his country was a reliable partner. 'Russia fulfills its obligations to supply energy resources to the world market and plays a stabilizing role in it by participating in such authoritative formats as OPEC+,' Putin said in a September 26 address to the conference. OPEC also did not respond to VOA requests for comment. In a press release issued Sunday, OPEC said that Russia — along with Iraq and Kazakhstan — had 'strongly reaffirmed' their commitment to cut oil output. Danylyuk said the interests of the West and OPEC were now aligned, 'because the West doesn't want Russia to make money and OPEC doesn't want Russia to steal money from them.' 'Obviously, the only way to reduce Russia's ability to make that money is to just reject them from OPEC,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-russia-deceives-opec-on-oil-sales-to-fund-ukraine-war/7852345.html	2024-11-05T13:35:59-08:00	
Report: Russia deceives OPEC on oil sales to fund Ukraine war	Russia is 'flagrantly violating' its agreements with the oil cartel OPEC by concealing the true amount of oil it is producing and selling, according to a new report that says the profits are funding Moscow’s war on Ukraine.

Iran FM: Tehran determined to respond to Israel's attack at 'appropriate time'	Islamabad — Iran's chief diplomat said Tuesday that Tehran opposes military escalation in the region but 'will certainly respond' to the deadly Oct. 26 strike by Israel against his country. During an official visit to neighboring Pakistan, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi discussed the Israeli attack on Iranian military bases and other installations, resulting in the deaths of at least five people, mostly security personnel. 'Unlike the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran does not seek escalation. However, we reserve our inherent right to legitimate defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter,' he told a joint news conference in Islamabad with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar. 'We would certainly respond to the Israeli aggression in a proper time and in a proper manner in a very measured and well-calculated manner,' Araghchi said without elaborating further. Israeli warplanes conducted the October 26 strikes, saying they were in retaliation for Tehran's missile barrage on October 1. Iran described its military action as a response to the killing of militant leaders backed by Tehran and a commander from the Revolutionary Guards. On Sunday, Iranian state media quoted President Masoud Pezeshkian as saying that a potential cease-fire between its regional allies and Israel 'could affect the intensity and type of' Iran's response to the Israeli attack. Dar stated Tuesday that during discussions with his Iranian counterpart, both sides condemned the 'unrestrained Israeli aggression' in the Middle East and emphasized the urgent need for a 'cease-fire' and 'de-escalation.' Gas pipeline Araghchi said that during his meetings in Islamabad, he also stressed the need to boost political, economic, commercial, and energy cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. He described terrorism as a mutual threat for both countries and urged enhanced cooperation. The two foreign ministers did not discuss the status of a long-stalled multi-billion-dollar pipeline, though, intended to export Iranian natural gas to energy-starved Pakistan. The United States is opposed to the project as a violation of its sanctions on Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Under a 2009 gas sales and purchase agreement for the cross-border pipeline, the Iranian side must supply Pakistan with up to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Iran's South Pars Field. However, the project has been on hold since then. Iranian officials have long announced that the 900-kilometer pipeline is completed on their side of the border. Pakistani officials say they have not started constructing their portion of the pipeline for fear of being slapped with U.S. sanctions. Tehran has been pressing Islamabad to uphold its end of the project or pay a reported financial penalty of up to $18 billion for delaying it. Pakistan has recently hired the services of two U.S.-based law firms to represent the country at the International Court of Arbitration in anticipation of a potential situation in which Iran may compel Islamabad to fulfill its obligations or face financial penalties. The move followed Tehran's reported final notice to Islamabad in August before seeking arbitration from the Paris-based body.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-fm-tehran-determined-to-respond-to-israel-s-attack-at-appropriate-time/7852689.html	2024-11-05T12:56:42-08:00	
WHO: 2 UK mpox cases first local transmissions in Europe	London — Two new cases of the mpox variant clade 1b detected in the U.K. are the first locally transmitted cases in Europe and the first outside Africa, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. The U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed late Monday that the two new cases were household contacts of Britain's first case identified last week, bringing the country's total confirmed cases to three. The WHO warned that European states should be prepared for 'rapid action' to contain the latest mpox variant, which spreads through close physical contact including sexual relations and sharing closed spaces. The two cases are also the first to be locally transmitted outside Africa since August 2024, when the WHO declared the outbreak of the new variant an international public health emergency — its highest level of alarm. Those affected are under specialist care and the risk to the U.K. population 'remains low,' UKHSA said. The original case was detected after the person traveled to several African countries on holiday and returned to the U.K. on Oct. 21. The patient developed flu-like symptoms more than 24 hours later and, on Oct. 24, started to develop a rash that worsened in the following days. Mpox, a viral disease related to smallpox, has two types, clade 1 and clade 2. Symptoms include fever, a skin rash or pus-filled blisters, swollen lymph nodes and body aches. The WHO first declared an international public health emergency in 2022 over the spread of clade 2. That outbreak mostly affected gay and bisexual men in Europe and the United States. Vaccination and awareness drives in many countries helped stem the number of worldwide cases and the WHO lifted the emergency in May 2023 after reporting 140 deaths out of around 87,400 cases. In 2024, a two-pronged epidemic of clade 1 and clade 1b, a new strain that affects children, has spread widely in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new strain has also been recorded in neighboring Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, with imported cases in Sweden, India, Thailand, Germany and the U.K.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-2-uk-mpox-cases-first-local-transmissions-in-europe/7852677.html	2024-11-05T12:05:25-08:00	
Israel's Netanyahu dismisses his defense minister	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday the trust between the two men had evaporated over the course of Israel’s war on Gaza. 'Over the past few months that trust has eroded,' Netanyahu said in a statement. 'In light of this, I decided today to end the term of the defense minister.' 'In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,' Netanyahu said. 'Significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign' in Gaza, said Netanyahu. Despite 'many attempts to bridge these gaps,' the prime minister said, 'they kept getting wider.' Netanyahu has appointed Foreign Minister Israel Katz to replace Gallant. Some information provided by the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israels-netanyahu-dismisses-his-defense-minister/7852644.html	2024-11-05T11:35:51-08:00	
More than 100 patients to be medically evacuated from Gaza	geneva — In a rare and welcome move, the World Health Organization says more than 100 patients, including children, who are suffering from severe trauma injuries and chronic diseases will be medically evacuated from Gaza Wednesday to countries where they can receive medical treatment for their condition. 'These are ad hoc measures. What we have been requesting for repeatedly is a sustained medevac [medical evacuation] outside Gaza, an organized, sustained medevac,' Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said in a call Tuesday with journalists in Geneva. Speaking in Gaza, Peeperkorn said that as many as 113 patients who are 'on the Ministry of Health priority list' for medical evacuation will be gathered at the European Gaza hospital tonight 'and from six in the morning — that is the plan — they will be brought to Kerem Shalom and then across Kerem Shalom to Ramallah airport.' 'The majority of the patients will go to the UAE,' he said 'and then I think something like 13 patients will go to Romania. So, that is the plan for tomorrow.' While affirming the importance of the operation, Peeperkorn noted the number of people being evacuated from war-torn Gaza paled in comparison to the needs. 'We estimate that approximately 12,000 to 14,000 critical patients need to be medevaced, half of them probably trauma-related — what we call serious trauma cases — amputations, spinal cord injuries, burns, etc., with the other half being chronic cases,' including cancer, cardiovascular, blood and liver diseases, he said. Before the Rafah crossing in South Gaza near the Egyptian border was closed on May 6, nearly 5,000 patients were medevaced outside the Palestinian enclave. Since then, only 282 patients have been evacuated. The last WHO-led operation occurred on September 11 when 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions were transported out of Gaza via Kerem Shalom for medical treatment. 'We cannot continue the way we do now. We need medical corridors,' Peeperkorn said. 'The first medical corridors we have repeatedly requested to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank to the hospitals that are there already. 'And a second medical corridor to Egypt should be opened again, and maybe to Jordan, and from there when other countries are willing to receive patients, they can go to other areas,' he said. While plans for transporting patients outside the Gaza Strip are moving ahead, a second round of polio vaccinations aimed at reaching more than a half million children under age 10 is winding down. The World Health Organization says a second dose of novel oral polio vaccine has been administered to more than 450,000 children, and more than 364,000 children have received vitamin A in central and southern Gaza. Unfortunately, a similar campaign 'was compromised' in northern Gaza because of the dire conditions prevailing in the region. Peeperkorn said the technical committee, which is the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, UNRWA, and NGO partners, decided to postpone the vaccination campaign from October 23 until November 2 'due to the lack of access, the lack of assured humanitarian pauses, the intense bombardment and the mass evacuation orders.' 'The committee decided to go ahead after the delay and to do our level best to cover as many kids as possible,' he said, noting that between November 2 and 4, the campaign managed to vaccinate 88% of the targeted 119,000 children under 10, and it provided nearly 84,000 children with vitamin A. 'This is an exceptional achievement,' he said, while acknowledging it will take weeks if not months 'for us to know how successful this campaign has been.' Peeperkorn participated in a mission that reached Kamal Adwan hospital Sunday, managing to deliver medical and surgical supplies, as well as other urgent necessities of fuel, food and water. The team also transferred 25 patients and 37 companions to Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital. The WHO official presented an alarming picture of conditions in northern Gaza and the dangers encountered by medical staff and patients alike. 'There was intense bombardment in close proximity to the hospital even during the mission,' he said. 'Shortly after the WHO mission to Kamal Adwan Hospital departed, the facility’s third floor reportedly was hit, injuring six children who are patients there. One child reportedly sustained a critical injury. Water tanks were damaged.' He said, 'The needs are enormous. The Emergency Department is full of patients, more than 40 casualties. The inpatient department also was full of hospitalized patients and their caregivers.' Northern Gaza has three hospitals. Peeperkorn said the Indonesian Hospital is not functional and the other two, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals, are 'only minimally functional. … There are no functional primary health care centers or medical points in North Gaza.' While an estimated 150,000 people 'were forcibly evacuated from the region,' he noted that an estimated population of 75,000 people remain. Given the health situation in northern Gaza, he said, 'It is critically vital that these hospitals remain functional.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-100-patients-to-be-medically-evacuated-from-gaza-/7852604.html	2024-11-05T10:57:24-08:00	
Lack of justice makes media more vulnerable to attacks, analysts say	In countries experiencing war or internal conflict, attacks on journalists are happening with impunity.

A week after Spain's floods, families hopeful missing loved ones are alive	SEDAVI, Spain — Francisco Murgui went out to try to salvage his motorbike when the water started to rise. He never came back. One week after catastrophic flooding devastated eastern Spain, Maria Murgui still holds out hope that her father is alive and among the unknown number of the missing. 'He was like many people in town who went out to get their car or motorbike to safety,' the 27-year-old told The Associated Press. 'The flash flood caught him outside, and he had to cling to a tree in order to escape drowning. He called us to tell us that he was fine, that we shouldn’t worry.' But when Maria set out into the streets of Sedavi to try to rescue him from the water washing away everything in its path, he was nowhere to be found. 'He held up until 1 in the morning,' she said. 'By 2, I went outside with a neighbor and a rope to try to locate him. But we couldn’t find him. And since then, we haven’t heard anything about him.' At least 218 have been confirmed dead after a deluge caused by heavy rains late on October 29 and the next morning swamped entire communities, mostly in Spain's Valencia region, catching most off guard. Regional authorities have been heavily criticized for having issued alerts to mobile phones some two hours after the disaster had started. Authorities have yet to any give an estimate of the missing seven days on. Spanish state broadcaster RTVE, however, shows a steady stream of appeals by people who are searching for family members who are not accounted for. Maria Murgui herself has posted a missing person’s message on social media with a photo of her father, a 57-year-old retiree. 'This is like riding a roller coaster. Sometimes I feel very bad and sometimes I feel better. I try to stay positive,' she said. 'This truly is madness. We don’t know what else to do. Neither does anybody else in town.' Relief package While many search for their loved ones, the gargantuan recovery efforts in Sedavi and dozens of other communities slowly moved forward. To aid those in need, the central government approved a 10.6-billion-euro relief package for 78 communities on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez compared it to the measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. The package includes direct payments of 20,000 euros to 60,000 euros to owners of damaged homes, among other financial aid for businesses and municipal governments. 'We have a lot of work left to do, and we know it,' Sanchez said. Sanchez said that he will ask the European Union to help pay for the relief, saying, 'it is time for the European Union to help.' Many people are still without basic goods amid scenes of devastation. Street after street in town after town is still covered with thick brown mud and mounds of ruined belongings, clumps of rotting vegetation, and wrecked vehicles. A stench arises from the muck. In many places, people still face shortages of basic goods, and lines form at impromptu emergency kitchens and stands handing out food. Water is running again but authorities say it is not fit for drinking. The ground floors of thousands of homes have been ruined. It is feared that inside some of the vehicles that the water washed away or trapped in underground garages there could be bodies waiting to be recovered. Thousands of soldiers are working with firefighters and police reinforcements in the immense emergency response. Officers and troops are searching in destroyed homes, the countless cars strewn across highways, streets, or lodged in the mud in canals and gorges. Authorities are worried about other health problems caused by the aftermath of the deadliest natural disaster in Spain's recent history. They have urged people to get tetanus shots and to treat any wounds to prevent infections and to clean the mud from their skin. Many people wear face masks. Thousands of volunteers are helping out, filling the void left by authorities. But the frustration over the crisis management boiled over on Sunday when a crowd in hard-hit Paiporta hurled mud and other objects at Spain’s royals, Sanchez and regional officials when they made their first visit to the epicenter of the flood damage. Sanchez’s national government is set to announce a new package of relief on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-week-after-spain-floods-families-hopeful-missing-loved-ones-are-alive/7852219.html	2024-11-05T08:22:41-08:00

Iran claims Iranian-German prisoner died before he could be executed	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — An Iranian official claimed Tuesday that Iranian-German prisoner Jamshid Sharmahd died before Tehran could execute him — directly contradicting the country's earlier announcement he had been put to death. The comment by Asghar Jahangir came after Germany shut down all three Iranian consulates in the country over Sharmahd's death, leaving only the embassy in Berlin open. Germany later disputed Jahangir's remark. Meanwhile, even Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has offered his own criticism of Germany's response to Sharmahd's death as tensions remain high between Tehran and the West over its rapidly advancing nuclear program and the ongoing Mideast wars. The judiciary's Mizan news agency quoted Jahangir as saying: 'Jamshid Sharmahd was sentenced to death, his sentence was ready to be carried out, but he passed away before implementation of the sentence.' He did not elaborate. Jahangir's remarks were made to the state-affiliated Quds newspaper after a weekly news conference, when journalists typically buttonhole the spokesperson into answering questions he didn't take from the podium. Germany's Foreign Ministry, reacting to the official's comment, said, 'His death was confirmed to us by the Iranian side. 'Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted by Iran and held for years without a fair trial, in inhumane conditions and without the necessary medical care,' the ministry said. 'Iran is responsible for his death.' Germany added it was 'lobbying the Iranian government to hand over his body to his family.' The State Department in the United States, where Sharmahd once lived, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jason Poblete, a lawyer representing Sharmahd's family, told The Associated Press that the conflicting comments from Iran were 'deeply concerning.' 'This inconsistency raises serious questions about the circumstances of the death and the transparency of the Iranian system,' Poblete said. 'The family has been urging the German and U.S. authorities to investigate this matter to ascertain the truth, ensure accountability thoroughly and reunite Jimmy with his family in California.' Iran had said it executed Sharmahd on October 28. He was 69. Iran accused Sharmahd, who lived in Glendora, California, of planning a 2008 attack on a mosque that killed 14 people — including five women and a child — and wounded over 200 others, as well as plotting other assaults through the little-known Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing. Iran also accused Sharmahd of 'disclosing classified information' on missile sites of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard during a television program in 2017. His family disputed the allegations and worked for years to see him freed. Germany, the U.S. and international rights groups dismissed Sharmahd's trial as a sham. Amnesty International said the proceedings against Sharmahd were a 'grossly unfair trial' because he was denied access to an independent lawyer and 'the right to defend himself.' However, Amnesty also noted that Sharmahd ran a website for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran and its Tondar militant wing that included claims of 'responsibility for explosions inside Iran,' although he repeatedly denied being involved in the attacks. Sharmahd was apparently kidnapped while on a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2020. His family received their last message from him on July 28, 2020. It's unclear how the abduction happened, but tracking data showed that Sharmahd's cellphone traveled south from Dubai to the city of Al Ain on July 29, crossing the border into Oman. On July 30, tracking data showed the phone traveled to the Omani port city of Sohar, where the signal stopped. Two days later, Iran announced it had captured Sharmahd in a 'complex operation.' The Intelligence Ministry published a photograph of him blindfolded. In the time since his execution, Germany shut the consulates. It's a diplomatic tool Germany seldom uses and signals a major downgrade in relations with Tehran. However, Iran has responded by criticizing Germany and the West, including Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise of getting sanctions on the Islamic Republic lifted. 'When someone who has slaughtered dozens is executed, they say you do not observe human rights,' Pezeshkian said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-claims-iranian-german-prisoner-died-before-he-could-be-executed/7852164.html	2024-11-05T07:41:59-08:00	
Brazilian police official chosen as next head of Interpol	London — Brazilian police official Valdecy Urquiza will be the next chief of Interpol, the global police organization announced Tuesday. Urquiza was elected secretary-general by a vote of Interpol's general assembly at its meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, and will take up the post when the gathering ends on Thursday. Currently Interpol's vice president for the Americas, Urquiza is the first chief of the Lyon, France-based organization not to come from Europe or the United States. The Interpol secretary-general essentially runs the organization on a daily basis. Juergen Stock of Germany, who has held the post since 2014, is not allowed under its rules to seek a third term. Urquiza pledged to promote diversity within the organization, saying 'a strong Interpol is one that includes everyone.' 'When we respect and elevate diverse perspectives, we get a clearer, more comprehensive approach to global security,' he said. Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields such as counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. The world's biggest police organization has been grappling with challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries. Interpol had a total budget of about $188 million last year, compared to more than $200 million at the European Union's police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-police-official-chosen-as-next-head-of-interpol/7852038.html	2024-11-05T06:15:13-08:00

Ukraine reports downing 48 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down two Russian guided missiles as well as 48 of the 79 drones that Russian forces used in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Ivan Fedorov, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, said Tuesday a Russian attack killed at least six people and wounded 16 others. Fedorov said on Telegram that Russia hit an infrastructure facility. Officials in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region also reported a Russian attack that injured two people and damaged three apartment buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed six Ukrainian aerial drones over the Kursk region. The governor of Bryansk, Alexander Bogomaz, said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties. A spokesperson for the South Korean Defense Ministry said at a briefing Tuesday that there are more than 10,000 North Korea soldiers currently in Russia, including a portion deployed to frontline areas such as in Kursk. The statement, which spokesperson Jeon Ha-Gyu said was based on intelligence authorities, came a day after a similar assessment from the U.S. Defense Department. Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters that there could be as many as 11,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops in Russia, with most of them in Kursk. Ryder said the Pentagon could not corroborate reports that the North Koreans were engaged in combat. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-downing-48-russian-drones-/7851881.html	2024-11-05T03:35:44-08:00	
Toxic smog wreathes India's capital as winter nears	NEW DELHI — A toxic smog shrouded the Indian capital on Tuesday, driving air quality in some areas into the 'severe' range ahead of winter, when cold air traps pollutants and brings a spike in respiratory illnesses. The mix of smoke, emissions, and dust is an annual problem for authorities in New Delhi, with vehicles, construction dust, and smoke from farm fires in the adjoining northern states of Punjab and Haryana among the major contributors. 'The outlook for the subsequent six days: the air quality is likely to be in the 'very poor' to 'severe' category,' said the earth sciences ministry. The city's overall score on an air quality index kept by India's top pollution authorities was 'very poor' at 384, the ministry added, and was likely to stay there until Thursday. An index range of 401 to 500 falls into the 'severe' category, implying it affects healthy people, but is more serious for those already fighting disease. Ministry data showed farm fires have increasingly swelled the pollution over the last three days, for a share of more than 23% on Monday, from about 15% on Saturday. About a third of the city's 39 monitoring stations showed a 'severe' score of more than 400 on Tuesday, said the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), well short of an air quality score of zero to 50 that it rates as 'good.' Swiss group IQAir also rated Delhi the world's second most polluted city on Tuesday, after Lahore in neighboring Pakistan, where authorities also took emergency measures in the wake of Sunday's unprecedented pollution levels. The government in the eastern province of Punjab, home to Lahore, has blamed deteriorating air quality on pollution wafting in from India, an issue it has vowed to take up with its neighbor through the foreign ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toxic-smog-wreathes-india-s-capital-as-winter-nears/7851854.html	2024-11-05T02:40:01-08:00	
Two Chinese nationals shot and injured in southern Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan said Tuesday that a local security guard at a factory in the southern port city of Karachi shot and injured two Chinese nationals, the third attack this year in the country targeting workers from China. Zia ul Haq Langar, the home minister of the Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, confirmed the shooting incident, saying it took place in an industrial area. He said an investigation was underway. Police officials reported that a 'heated argument' and subsequent 'scuffle' with the Chinese workers prompted the guard to open fire on them. The foreigners were taken to a local hospital, where one of them was said to be in 'critical condition.' The shooting comes amid Islamabad’s rare tensions with close ally Beijing that stem from growing security threats to Chinese workers and engineers working on infrastructure development projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. At a seminar in Pakistan's capital last week, the Chinese ambassador criticized the repeated attacks on Chinese citizens in the country, labeling them as 'unacceptable' and a barrier to their investments in the South Asian nation. It is extremely rare for Beijing to publicly admonish Islamabad over the security threats to its workers. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in an unprecedented response, described the Chinese envoy's remarks as 'perplexing' and inconsistent with 'the diplomatic traditions' that exist between the two nations. Last month, a suicide car bomber in Karachi killed two Chinese engineers and wounded another, along with several local security personnel. The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack. In March this year, a suicide car bombing in northwestern Pakistan killed five Chinese workers and their local driver traveling to a major hydropower project in the area. The attacks have increased the number of Chinese workers killed in the country to 21 since the launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) nearly a decade ago, which is a major infrastructure project stemming from President Xi Jinping’s global BRI plans. Beijing has repeatedly urged Islamabad to improve security for its nationals working in Pakistan.

Chad president threatens to withdraw from regional force after Boko Haram attack kills over 40 Chad troops	Yaoundé, Cameroon — Chad says it will withdraw its troops from the United Nations-supported Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, which combats Boko Haram in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Officials from Chad say its military is not getting enough assistance to fight the terrorist group since an attack last week killed more than 40 of Chad’s soldiers. Chad's President Mahamat Idiss Deby says his country will pull out of the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, which has some 11,000 troops, because of the absence of what he calls coordinated efforts among member states troops in jointly fighting Boko Haram terrorism. A release read on Chad's state TV on Monday says Deby is surprised at the slow pace at which the task force, a regional group that includes rescue workers, reacts to Boko Haram attacks. The task force was created in April 2012 by Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Benin and Nigeria to jointly fight Boko Haram and bring back peace in areas affected by terrorism in Lake Chad Basin shared by the five countries. The African Union, or AU, authorized the force to operate in February 2015. The force says it receives regular technical support from the United Nations to protect civilians affected by terrorism in the Lake Chad Basin. Deby did not say when Chad will withdraw troops. The Central African state’s president, however, says Chad's military will protect civilians from all forms of terrorism, including Boko Haram. Remadji Hoinathy is a lecturer at the Department of Anthropology at the University of N'Djamena in Chad and a researcher on strategic development in central Africa and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. He said Deby is disgruntled because Chad is not receiving the assistance it needs to track and eliminate several hundred Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed more than 40 Chad government troops in the Lake Chad Basin last week. He said Deby, who is in the Lake Chad area to supervise a security operation to fight the assailants after the deadly attack, is dissatisfied that his troops are not getting immediate assistance from Cameroon, Benin, Niger and Nigeria. Remadji spoke Monday on Chad state TV. Chad's government sait it informed the task force after last week’s attack on its troops in Ngouboua, a western village in Lake Chad, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria. Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Benin are yet to react to Deby's threats to pull his troops from the task force. The statement about Chad troops leaving was issued after media reports that the central African state’s military recently deployed to fight Boko Haram mistakenly killed at least a dozen fishermen in Lake Chad thinking that they were militants. Chad's government said reports that its fighter jets bombed the fishermen were unfounded. Belngar Larme Laguerre is the president of Chad’s National Commission on Human Rights. He spoke via a messaging app from N’Djamena. He said Boko Haram hides among civilians or uses civilians as human shields when attacked, but that Chad troops are well-trained to find terrorists hiding among civilians. He said he has not received complaints from civilians that the Chad soldiers deployed to fight Boko Haram last week disrespected human rights. Local media reported that the attack on fishermen took place in Tilma, an island on the border with Nigeria. VOA could not independently verify if there was an attack on civilians. Some 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-president-threatens-to-withdraw-from-regional-force-after-boko-haram-attack-kills-over-40-chad-troops-/7851832.html	2024-11-05T01:54:46-08:00	
Nigerian president orders release of underage protesters following outrage	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian President Bola Tinubu ordered the immediate release Monday of some 29 minors detained during anti-government protests in August after their court trial sparked outrage and widespread condemnation. The protesters faced treason charges punishable by death according to Nigerian law. But human rights groups saaid recent suppression of protesters is an attempt by authorities to stifle dissent. Nigeria's information minister, Mohammed Idris, told reporters that Tinubu ordered the immediate release of all minors arraigned in connection with the anti-government protests in early August. He said Tinubu also called for a probe of the security operatives involved in their arrest and ordered the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to help rehabilitate the minors. The children were among 76 protesters who had been detained since early August. They appeared before the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday, most of them looking frail and sick. Their arraignment sparked widespread condemnation of the government by human rights groups including Amnesty International. Amnesty said putting underage protesters on trial shows the government's disregard for the rule of law, and it called for the minors to be released unconditionally and immediately. Among the charges they face are treason and attempting to destabilize the government. Under Nigerian law, treason is punishable by a possible death sentence. 'Any form of trial that has a child as a defendant is illegal, unconstitutional and null and void,' said Marshal Abubakar, a lawyer for the protesters. 'We have informed the court through our notice of criminal objection challenging the court's jurisdiction to try those children.' Abubaker said the proceedings were a violation of the children's fundamental human rights. Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission also criticized the trial, accusing authorities of manipulating state institutions to punish citizens. In early August, many Nigerians took to the streets to denounce government policies they said had increased the cost of living. The so-called 'Ten Days of Rage' protests aimed to pressure the government to abandon unpopular economic policies. However, security forces cracked down and quelled the demonstrations. Nigerian police accused the protesters of attempting to foment violence. Before the minors were ordered to be released, Nigerian police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi said the protesters were criminally liable even if they were underage. 'Once you're more than 7 [years old], you can be charged to court,' said Muyiwa Adejobi of the national police. 'The only thing is that you need to follow certain procedures to do that. The youngest should be 13. So, we have charged them to court on behalf of the federal government of Nigeria, because these are those who actually leveraged on the protests, they hijacked the protests, and they're so violent.' Last year, Tinubu introduced several reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies, which he says will boost Nigeria’s economy. But citizens facing higher living costs have been pushing back against the policies and have blamed the government for their hardship. Abubakar said the government wants to curb demonstrations of any kind. 'Over the months this government has shown that they are interested in curtailing the civic space and denying Nigerians of their fundamental human rights to dissent and to demand for a better life for themselves,' Abubakar said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-president-orders-release-of-underage-protesters-following-outrage-/7851818.html	2024-11-05T01:36:53-08:00	
India aims to curb judges' arbitrary sentences for criminals, sources say	NEW DELHI — India plans to overhaul its criminal sentencing norms to counter accusations of arbitrary punishment, sources said, following public outrage over the 2022 rape conviction of a man within 30 minutes of trial, by a judge who handed him the death penalty. A higher court in the eastern state of Bihar later overturned the conviction and ordered a retrial, saying the man had been denied the opportunity to defend himself and the judge had acted in 'utmost haste.' It also called for more training for the judge. In response, the government plans to develop a grading system to ensure punishment matches the crime, and help standardize sentencing, so pulling the judicial system closer in line with the likes of Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The law and justice ministry will unveil its plan to the Supreme Court around December, after the court asked the government in May to consider adopting a comprehensive sentencing policy following the Bihar case, one source said. The government sources sought anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to the media. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The source said while the plan had not been finalized, one suggestion was for a minimum punishment that will make it easier for judges, especially those in lower courts, to dole out sentences proportionate to the crime. The policy would cover all criminal cases but the Bihar case, dating from 2021, was tried under the Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), which prescribes punishment ranging from three years in jail to death. The source said lower court judges often award the harshest punishment in such cases, given the outrage around the crimes. In 2018, another lower court judge in central India ordered death for a man accused of raping and murdering a baby girl 23 days after his arrest, amid street protests against the crime. The pace of the trial and questions about the legal defense given to the accused fueled concern among some rights advocates. India's judicial system is straining under a backlog of tens of millions of cases, including nearly 300,000 sexual offenses against children, many of them in fast-track courts set up to exclusively try incidents of sexual assault. In September, Reuters reported that the government had slashed its goal of swiftly setting up thousands of such fast-track courts to try sex crimes. The change came after states such as West Bengal, where the recent brutal rape and homicide of a doctor shook the nation, fell far short of their targets regarding such courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-aims-to-curb-judges-arbitrary-sentences-for-criminals-sources-say/7851812.html	2024-11-05T01:16:00-08:00	
India's top court overturns northern state's ban on Islamic schools	NEW DELHI — India's Supreme Court set aside on Tuesday an order that banned Islamic schools in the country's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, providing a breather to thousands of students and teachers. In March, the Allahabad High Court had scrapped a 2004 law governing the schools, called madrasas, saying it violated the constitutional tenet of secularism, and directing that all their students be moved to conventional schools. By setting aside the March order, the Supreme Court allowed the 25,000 Muslim schools to operate in the northern state, however, providing relief to 2.7 million students and 10,000 teachers. 'The act is consistent with the positive obligation of the state to ensure that the children get adequate education,' Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said in court. There was no immediate comment from the state government in response. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which also governs Uttar Pradesh, has been converting hundreds of madrasas into conventional schools in the northeastern state of Assam as well. Muslims and rights groups have accused some BJP members and affiliates of promoting anti-Islamic hate speech and vigilantism, and of demolishing properties owned by Muslims. Modi and the BJP deny religious discrimination exists in India, saying they work for the development of all communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-top-court-overturns-northern-state-s-ban-on-islamic-schools/7851809.html	2024-11-05T01:02:06-08:00	
World's first wooden satellite, developed in Japan, heads to space	KYOTO, JAPAN — The world's first wooden satellite, built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space on Tuesday, in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration. LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 km (250 miles) above the Earth. Named after the Latin word for 'wood,' the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space. 'With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,' said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi's team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material. 'Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,' said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. 'A wooden satellite should be feasible, too.' Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there's no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimizes the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminum oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. 'Metal satellites might be banned in the future,' Doi said. 'If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk's SpaceX.' The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge wood's ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data center construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. 'It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,' he said. 'Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-first-wooden-satellite-developed-in-japan-heads-to-space/7851802.html	2024-11-05T00:34:16-08:00	
Tropical Storm Rafael forms in the Caribbean and could hit Cuba as a hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Tropical Storm Rafael formed Monday in the Caribbean and will bring heavy rain to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before strengthening into a hurricane and likely hitting Cuba, forecasters said. Later in the week it also is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Florida and portions of the U.S. Southeast, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Jamaica, and a hurricane watch was in effect for the Cayman Islands and for parts of Cuba including the provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas, and the Isle of Youth. A tropical storm watch was issued for Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Las Tunas in Cuba. A tropical storm watch also was issued for the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and for the Dry Tortugas. The storm was located about 245 kilometers south of Kingston, Jamaica. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 kph while moving north-northwest at 15 kph, the center said. The storm was expected to move near Jamaica late Monday, be near or over the Cayman Islands late Tuesday as a hurricane and approach Cuba on Wednesday. Most forecasts show the storm peaking as a Category 1 hurricane, 'but conditions over the next few days will favor strengthening so we'll need to monitor how quickly it organizes, and a stronger hurricane can't be ruled out,' wrote Michael Lowry, hurricane specialist and storm surge expert, in an analysis Monday. On Monday morning, the government of the Cayman Islands offered people sandbags and announced schools would close on Tuesday. 'Residents are urged to take immediate precautions to protect themselves and their properties,' the government said in a statement. Schools in Jamaica also were scheduled to close on Tuesday, with government offices closing on Monday afternoon. Cuban authorities said Monday night that some 37,000 people remained under evacuation orders in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather. The latest development comes on the heels of Tropical Storm Oscar, which dumped heavy rains in Cuba in October, leaving eight people dead and a widespread blackout across the island due to a collapse of the national energy system. Meanwhile, the Jamaica Observer newspaper reported a large landslide in a rural area north of the Kingston capital on Sunday that officials blamed on persistent rains ahead of the potential storm. No injuries were reported, but a couple of communities were left isolated. Heavy rainfall will affect the western Caribbean with totals of 7 to 15 centimeters and up to 23 cm expected locally in Jamaica and parts of Cuba. Flooding and mudslides are possible. Rafael is the 17th named storm of the season. On the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Patty dissipated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-rafael-forms-in-the-caribbean-and-could-hit-cuba-as-a-hurricane/7851785.html	2024-11-04T23:08:49-08:00	
China warns military members against online dating, gambling	BEIJING — In an unusual warning, China's navy told young officers and personnel that they could get ensnared by online dating scams and virtual gambling if they let down their guard, exposing themselves to security risks and undermining the military. Addressing those born from 1990 who are 'becoming the core of the army,' the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy said in a social media post that young soldiers should avoid revealing their military identity online as they could be 'extremely easy' targets of criminals. The political and confidential nature of the military profession dictates that the military personnel identity must not be exposed online, it said. 'Distinguish carefully and keep some distance when making friends online,' a line in the post advised, and 'never lose sight of your principles and make random friends with netizens.' The navy also cautioned against virtual gambling, which is illegal in China, likening gambling addiction to being 'possessed by a demon' and warning against schemes that could lead to a 'fall into an endless abyss' of debt. China's military projects an image of power, from launching drills around democratically governed Taiwan to deploying patrols in the South China Sea. But President Xi Jinping, also the military's commander-in-chief, has often warned that the armed forces face 'deep-seated' problems from within, including corruption and a lack of discipline. Young soldiers are not the only demographic singled out. Xi has also stressed political loyalty from senior military personnel. At a military conference in June, Xi emphasized upholding the Chinese Communist Party's 'absolute leadership' over the PLA and that the armed forces must always 'uphold their core values, maintain purity, and strictly adhere to discipline.' Xi attributed the root cause of problems to the lack of ideals and beliefs, calling on the armed forces particularly senior cadres, to 'introspect, engage in soul-searching reflections, and make earnest rectifications,' according to official news agency Xinhua.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-military-members-against-online-dating-gambling/7851769.html	2024-11-04T22:19:40-08:00	
Boeing workers accept contract, end more than 7-week strike	SEATTLE — Unionized machinists at Boeing voted Monday to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks, clearing the way for the aerospace giant to resume production of its bestselling airliner and generate much-needed cash. Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company's fourth formal offer and the third put to a vote. The deal includes pay raises of 38% over four years, and ratification and productivity bonuses. However, Boeing refused to meet strikers' demand to restore a company pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago. The contract's ratification on the eve of Election Day clears the way for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to restart Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the factory workers' walkout have idled for 53 days. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees Monday night that he was pleased to have reached an agreement. 'While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,' Ortberg said. 'We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.' According to the union, the 33,000 workers it represents can return to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing's CEO has said it might take 'a couple of weeks' to resume production in part because some could need retraining. The contract decision is 'most certainly not a victory,' said Eep Bolaño, a Boeing calibration specialist based in Seattle who voted in favor of ratification. Bolaño said she and her fellow workers made a wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer. 'We were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country couldn't even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is humiliating,' Bolaño said. Leaders of IAM District 751 had endorsed the latest proposal, saying they thought they had gotten all they could though negotiations and the strike. 'It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,' the union district said before Monday's vote. 'We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success.' The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to the company. A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial peril and uncertainty. CEO Kelly Ortberg, an outsider who started at Boeing only in August, has announced plans to lay off about 10% of the workforce, about 17,000 people, due to the strike and a series of other factors that diminished the company's reputation and fortunes this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-workers-accept-contract-end-more-than-7-week-strike-/7851763.html	2024-11-04T21:48:52-08:00	
US presidential election in the hands of voters as Harris, Trump battle for White House	Millions of U.S. voters are set to cast their ballots Tuesday as they decide whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump will be the country’s next leader. Polls heading into Election Day indicated a tight race, particularly in a group of battleground states that will be key to deciding the winner. Both candidates made stops Monday in Pennsylvania, one of those closely watched states, holding a series of rallies including nearby each another in the Pittsburgh area as they projected confidence in their own campaigns. 'Tomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side,' Harris told her supporters gathered at a historic steel facility that nodded to Pittsburgh’s history as the heart of the country’s steel industry. 'Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America.' 'We must finish strong,' Harris added. 'Make no mistake, we will win.' Trump, addressing his supporters at a sports arena, said another Trump administration would 'launch the most extraordinary economic boom the world has ever seen.' 'If you vote for Kamala, you will have four more years of misery, failure and disaster,' Trump said. 'Our country may never recover. Vote for me and I will deliver rising wages, soaring income, and a colossal surge of jobs, wealth and opportunity for America of every race, religion, color and creed. Every one of them.' Ahead of Tuesday’s Election Day, more than 81 million Americans cast early votes, either in person at polling stations or by mail. The total is more than half the 158 million who voted in the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden defeated Trump. It was a Democratic victory that to this day Trump says he was cheated out of by fraudulent voting rules and vote counts. Dozens of court decisions, often rendered by Trump-appointed judges, went against him as he attempted to challenge the 2020 results. But Sunday, he told a Pennsylvania rally he 'shouldn’t have left' the White House in 2021 when Biden assumed office. Trump has said he will only accept Tuesday’s outcome if he concludes that the election is conducted fairly, which Democratic critics have said they assume means only if he wins. Both Trump and Harris have assembled vast teams of lawyers to contest voting and vote-counting issues as they materialize Tuesday during the day, into the evening and the following days, until a clear winner emerges. A Trump victory would make him only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms, after Grover Cleveland in the 1880s. He would also be the first felon to serve as president as he awaits sentencing later in November after being convicted of 34 charges linked to his hush money payment to a porn film star ahead of his successful 2016 run for the presidency. Trump has often punctuated his campaign with angry broadsides at his Democratic opponents, calling them the 'enemy within' the country and a threat to the country’s future. He has belittled Harris as a person of limited intellect and said she would be the pawn of other world leaders in dealing with international relationships. Harris for weeks has claimed she is the underdog in the campaign but lately expressed more optimism and now says she expects to become the country’s 47th president. If elected, she would be the first woman to be the American leader, its first of South Asian descent and its second Black president after Barack Obama. She has described Trump as an 'unserious man,' saying he would be a threat to American democracy and unhinged by any normal presidential constraints after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that presidents cannot be prosecuted for any wrongdoing linked to their official actions. Pollsters say the country’s voters are deeply divided between the two candidates. It is an assessment reflected in how major media outlets look at the possible outcome just ahead of the official Election Day. Last-minute polling shows the Harris-Trump race all but tied in the battleground states, within the margin of statistical error. ABC News polling shows Trump winning five of the seven battleground states, but The Washington Post says its aggregation of polls has Harris ahead in four. The New York Times says Trump is ahead in four, Harris two, and the race tied in Pennsylvania. The importance of battleground states cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Pennsylvania alone has 19 electoral votes. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the seven remaining battleground states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops.

Key county in swing state of Georgia counting ballots ahead of Election Day	Lawrenceville, Georgia — One of the most ethnically diverse counties in the Southeastern United States will be among those issuing early voting results Tuesday night, a reveal that could indicate which of the presidential candidates is in the lead in the crucial count of 538 electoral votes. The victor must receive at least 270 of those electoral votes, and Georgia, seen as one of the seven states where the outcome is uncertain, has 16 of those precious votes. Only Pennsylvania has more — 19 — among the battleground states. North Carolina also has 16. The other wild cards are Arizona (11), Michigan (15), Nevada (6) and Wisconsin (10). It is possible for the declared victor in the electoral count to lose the national popular vote total. That last happened in 2016, when Republican Donald Trump won 304 electoral votes but lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 2%. It could be days before the United States knows who its next president will be, but at the Gwinnett County Voter Registration and Elections headquarters in the swing state of Georgia, workers are already scanning several hundred thousand ballots submitted in advance by mail-in and early voters. The tabulations of those ballots will be released the moment the polls close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Up to 70% of the vote total from those already-processed ballots will be known within that first hour, said Zach Manifold, the county's elections supervisor. 'And then, kind of a long night begins,' Manifold told VOA on Monday. 'Our first precinct usually arrives maybe about 8:30, just depending on how much line there is at seven o'clock. But 8:30 is the first precinct. We have 156 precincts that all have to come back. I don't know why, but it always seems like that last one comes in sometime between 11:30 and midnight. 'After you get past midnight, you'll probably have just about all the precincts in and have a pretty good feel for the final — at least the unofficial results — for Gwinnett,' Manifold said. To demonstrate transparency, the media, which is expected to include dozens of TV news crews and other journalists from around the world, will be allowed in the large room where the ballots are opened. The reporters will be kept behind a cordon but not prevented from observing the entire process. Activities in the tabulation room, in another part of the same building, will be livestreamed online. Gwinnett County, with a population of about 1 million, is the second-largest county in Georgia. It is remarkable for its exceptional diversity, with no single ethnic group making up more than about one-third of its residents. In 2023, non-Hispanic whites made up about one-third of the country's population, as did African Americans, according to census data. 'We have a very large Hispanic population, Asian population, Black population,' said Manifold. 'It is a very much a mixture of what is America. And, so, I think a lot of the reason that people are wanting to see what Gwinnett's like [on election night] is, I think, Gwinnett is a lot like modern America.' Democrat Joe Biden's strong margin in this suburban county four years ago helped him narrowly win Georgia and thus the presidency, unseating Trump. Gwinnett County voted Republican every year between 1980 and 2012, but in line with a trend of suburban political realignment, went narrowly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump, a political novice that year, won Georgia overall in 2016, which was key to his unexpected presidential victory. Regardless of the outcome this week, Manifold knows he will be drinking a lot of coffee from Tuesday morning to stay alert. 'It's about a 24-hour day a lot of the time in these presidential elections,' he said. 'I'll start at our warehouse at 4 a.m., and we'll see what time we get out of here at the main office.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-county-in-swing-state-of-georgia-counting-ballots-ahead-of-election-day/7851747.html	2024-11-04T20:35:47-08:00	
Somali Americans gear up for US elections	MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Somali Americans in Minnesota last month took part in a town hall involving Democratic and Republican party representatives encouraging them to participate in the 2024 election, arguing the stakes are high for them and their grandchildren. During a VOA town hall event in Minneapolis, Somali Americans listened to remarks by panelists from both political parties, who answered questions about the economy, immigration, and foreign policy, explaining what their candidate would do to win the votes of Somali Americans. Economic policy While many Somali Americans are traditionally Democratic-leaning, there are rising numbers who support former President Donald Trump, crediting him for stronger economic conditions during his presidency, despite concerns over his immigration policies. Faisal Deri, chair of the African Republicans of Minnesota, urged Somali Americans to vote for Trump, stating that Somali Americans, including truck drivers, experienced positive economic conditions during his presidency. 'Truck drivers’ business was thriving, with a high volume of work and plenty of income flowing in. That brought significant money into the community, and they were able to send substantial support to their relatives in Somalia. But, under [President Joe] Biden’s term, business was down, and many have been forced to park their trucks,' Deri said. Nimo Ahmed, a Democrat and an activist, is the chair of the Somali American Coalition Action Fund. She said there's no way the community will vote for Trump, claiming his policies primarily benefit millionaires. '[Vice President Kamala] Harris will support small businesses, which are essential for many Somali families in Minnesota who run small stores. Trump had focused on supporting millionaires and would continue to do so, but we are middle-class people, and only the Democratic Party truly supports the middle class,' Ahmed said. Habon Abdulle, director of Ayada Leads, an organization that empowers African diaspora women, stressed that it is crucial for everyone to vote. 'Vote for whoever you choose, but please vote, because your vote reflects your values and who you’re negotiating with. Please make your voice heard,' Abdulle said. On the economy, the other questions posed to the panelists included: Why is the U.S. spending billions of dollars on foreign wars while homelessness persists in America? What actions can Harris take to address high interest rates, given the community’s desire for affordable homeownership? In response, Deri asserted that the ongoing wars abroad have contributed to rising interest rates. He noted that when Trump was in office, interest rates were low, allowing many Somalis to purchase homes. However, that is no longer the case, as affordability has decreased. 'If Trump returns to the White House, his first action would be to end the wars and cut foreign aid to Ukraine, rearranging those funds for use within the United States,' Deri said. Nimo Ahmed defended Harris on economic policies, asserting that her policies aim to support lower and middle-class Americans. Immigration policy Trump’s plans for 'mass deportations' as well as tightening immigration policy are also concerns for Somali Americans, as well as a travel ban that affected many foreign visitors during his last term in office. Community members said they worry reinstating travel bans could halt family reunifications, and mass deportations could impact many Somali residents in the United States. Ahmed, the Democrat party supporter, said Trump’s policies would not be good for Somali American communities. 'Trump doesn’t respect immigrants and has referred to them as ‘poisoning the blood.’ We must support Harris to prevent deportations so Somalis without legal status can live with dignity here. When Trump talks about ‘poisoning the blood,’ he’s including some Somalis in that group, so we need to protect them,' Ahmed said. In contrast, Deri, the Republican panelist, argued that Trump’s immigration policies focus on preventing criminals from entering the United States, a benefit to all American communities, including Somalis. 'The deportation policy targets criminals who bring drugs into the country, which especially harms minorities like us. The focus isn’t on Somalis, and each country’s rules must be respected,' Deri said. Foreign policy Ahead of the election, opinion surveys have indicated that many American Muslims oppose the Biden administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. During the VOA town hall, some participants questioned why they should support Harris when there seems to have been no significant action in ending the conflict in Gaza. 'I don’t support Biden and Harris for failing to establish a cease-fire in Gaza. It’s disheartening, but Trump doesn’t have anything for Gazans; their lives would only be worse if he were to be elected. I prefer Harris’s party because they can be held accountable, while Trump’s administration lacks that accountability,' Democrat Nimo Ahmed said. The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, following a terror attack in southern Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. Deri, the pro-Republican activist argued that the Biden-Harris administration's policies have been tested, and they missed their opportunity to deliver aid to Gaza. 'If we vote for Harris, we are rewarding someone who has failed. Trump is a strong leader, and he could potentially resolve the Gaza situation quickly,' Deri said. Amin Harun, a lawyer in Minneapolis, said the division of opinion among American Muslims is a significant issue. 'Some are voting, some are rejecting, and others are supporting different candidates. Unifying the voices of Muslims is essential for expressing their collective thoughts,' Harun said. Abdulle, the director of the Ayada Leads organization, underscored the importance of voting. 'Even if you don’t vote for the president, you need to participate in local elections, vote for local seats so that your votes make an impact,' Abdulle said. Ifrah Farah, a town hall attendee, said there should not be a reason to equate the policies of Biden with those of Harris, who she said has her own political agenda. Farah urged participants to vote, stating, 'Elections are crucial. If you're a citizen of this country, you should vote because it will benefit you and your children in the future.' As the community gears up for these crucial elections, there are dozens of Somali American candidates vying for seats to represent a rapidly growing immigrant community that has exceeded 300,000. This story originated in VOA’s Somali Service. The townhall was recorded on October 19, 2024, and was conducted in Somali. The discussion has been translated into English for this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-americans-gear-up-for-us-elections-/7851727.html	2024-11-04T20:15:03-08:00	
Canadian police arrest 3 men, following violence at Hindu temple	Canadian officials pressed charges against three people Monday, following the violence that erupted Sunday at a Hindu temple near Toronto where Sikh activists staged a Pro-Khalistan demonstration, according to a Reuters report. Local police say a 43-year-old man was charged with causing a disturbance and assaulting a peace officer and a 23-year-old man was charged with assault with a weapon. Meanwhile, a 31-year-old man was charged with mischief. In addition, police say they have been made aware of the video of an off-duty police officer who was seen participating in the protest. Police say they are investigating that case and the officer has been suspended. The prime ministers of India and Canada have denounced the violence that erupted Sunday at several locations in suburban Toronto, including the Hindu temple. 'I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the 'acts of violence' were unacceptable. Video of the disturbance at the temple appeared to show an altercation between Hindus and Sikhs that included footage of people hitting each other with flagpoles outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir in the city of Brampton, according to Reuters. It was not clear, however, how the violence was initiated. 'The Hindu community in Canada is feeling that they are not being provided a safe place for the worship,' Arunesh Giri, president of the Canadian Hindu Foundation told Agence France-Presse. A spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry called on Canada to 'ensure that all places of worship are protected' from attacks like the ones on Sunday. 'We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,' the ministry said. Sikh activists told Reuters that pro-Khalistan activists at the Hindu temple demonstration were protesting the presence of Indian diplomats. The activists said another rally was held at a Sikh temple. Khalistan is the Sikh homeland that some activists want created out of India’s Punjab state. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside of India. Footage of the disruptions posted on social media shows some people carrying the yellow flags of the pro-Khalistan movement. The violence comes amid frayed diplomatic ties between India and Canada. Canada recently expelled six Indian diplomats over the 2023 killing in Canada of a Sikh separatist leader. India’s tit-for-tat response to the expulsion of its diplomats from Canada was to expel six Canadian diplomats from India. Canada has accused India of targeting Sikh activists in Canada. India has said that allegation is 'absurd and baseless.' Some information provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7851724.html	2024-11-04T19:27:47-08:00	
China attempts to boost birth rate amid mounting challenges	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Jasmine Chen has been married for two years, but the idea of having children is not part of her plans. The 28-year-old bank teller who lives in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou said raising children in China is just too expensive. 'Even though anyone can raise children, regardless of their economic situation, I would want to make sure that I could give my children the best possible life if I decide to get pregnant, but that’s not what I think I could achieve,' she told VOA in a written response. Chen is among a growing number of young Chinese women who have decided not to have children despite a growing number of government policy measures, including subsidies and other incentives, aimed at boosting births. Last year, new births in China fell by 5.7%. That’s a record low of 6.39 births per 1,000. In contrast, the mortality rate was 7.87 per 1,000 people. The decline has led to the closure of more than 14,000 kindergartens across China according to China’s Ministry of Education. Statistics also show more than an 11% drop in preschool enrollments, and kindergarten enrollments experienced a 10.30% decrease. ‘Fertility friendly’ policies To boost the country’s declining birth rate, China’s State Council, the country’s chief administrative authority, rolled out a policy with 13 directives aimed at enhancing 'childbirth support services, expand childcare systems, strengthen support in education, housing, and employment, and foster a birth-friendly social atmosphere.' The new measures also include providing maternity insurance to rural migrant workers and people with flexible employment, as long as they have basic health insurance. The policy document also urges local authorities to implement parental leave. Other measures include offering subsidies and medical resources for children and the call on local governments to budget for childcare centers and preferential taxes or fees for these services. Local authorities are also encouraged 'to raise the limits of' housing loans to help families with multiple children buy homes. Despite the Chinese government’s efforts, analysts say these new measures may only have a limited impact on boosting China’s birth rate. 'China is currently facing a serious debt crisis, many local governments, especially those in northeastern or western provinces, won’t have enough financial resources to implement the policy directives that the state council has laid out,' Yi Fuxian, a demographer and expert on Chinese population trends at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told VOA by phone. Fertility rates in Asia China is not the only economy in the region that is struggling with low fertility rates. According to economists, a rate of 2.1 children per woman is needed to sustain a population over time. South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan have been struggling for years to raise their number of births. Yi said since Japan and Taiwan have already implemented similar measures with little success, it will be hard for the Chinese government to achieve its birth goals by rolling out these policy directives. 'Japan put so many resources into these policies, but its birth rate didn’t increase as a result, and the Chinese government may not have enough financial resources to replicate Japan’s policies,' he told VOA. One child policy Unlike most countries though, China had a stringent one-child policy for decades. That policy formally ended in 2016 when couples were allowed to have two children. However, the change in policy has done little to turn the trend around. In addition to financial challenges, Yi said China’s persistently low birth rate is also the result of less willingness to have children and the growing prevalence of infertility among Chinese women, in part due to trying to have a child later in life, according to researchers. 'The one-child policy has changed the concept of childbearing for several generations in China, resulting in the lack of willingness to have children among the younger generation in China,' Yi told VOA. Some young Chinese women told VOA that they worry once they have children, they would have to make a lot of compromises in their lives, including giving up the freedom to decide how to live their lives. 'Having a child and being responsible for it would make me lose the ability to leave for a trip whenever I want to and lose the very free lifestyle that I currently have,' Chen in Guangzhou said. Others said they are terrified of the responsibility that comes with having children. 'I’m relatively healthy. My financial situation is manageable, and my parents even agree to help me out if I ever decide to have children. But I simply don’t want to take on the responsibility that I can’t get rid of once I have children,' Catherine Wang, a 33-year-old woman living in Beijing, told VOA in a written response. Putting off marriage In addition to the unwillingness among some Chinese women to have children, more Chinese people are getting married much later in their lives. According to China’s official 2020 data, Chinese men’s average age for a first marriage was 29.38 while Chinese women’s average age for a first marriage was 27.95. Yi estimates that both numbers are probably now beyond 30 years old. 'Many people won’t be able to have children if they are delaying their marriage age and the Chinese government has done nothing to address this issue,' Yi told VOA. Data released by China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs on November 1 showed a drop in marriage registrations for the first nine months of 2024. It’s a year-on-year decrease of 943,000. Working overtime Long working hours and low wages for certain people, such as factory workers, will make it hard for them to raise children, said some labor rights groups. 'In China's manufacturing factories, workers frequently endure long shifts, typically from 8 AM to 8 PM, with only two days off per month, [and] the combination of low minimum wages and extended overtime working hours has resulted in numerous workers clocking over 300 hours per month,' wrote the editors of the China Labour Bulletin, or CLB, on the organization’s website. A CLB spokesperson told VOA in a written response that unless Chinese workers have support from extended families, it will be difficult for them to raise children. According to Chen, overtime work has been routine for her, and she does not think she can have enough time to childcare if she ever has children. 'Some people may seek help from nannies or older family members, but I think one thing that can’t be absent from children’s upbringing is quality time with their parents, and since my work is too busy, I don’t think I can fulfill that,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-attempts-to-boost-birth-rate-amid-mounting-challenges-/7851712.html	2024-11-04T18:33:08-08:00

Lebanon death toll in Hezbollah-Israel war surpasses 3,000	The death toll in Lebanon surpassed 3,000 Monday in the 13-month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with the vast majority killed since hostilities dramatically escalated in mid-September and Israel invaded south Lebanon on October 1. The Lebanese health ministry said more than 13,000 people have also been wounded. More than a million people have been displaced in the tiny country. Israel says the dead include hundreds of Hezbollah members. It also succeeded in assassinating the group’s top leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several senior commanders. In Israel, 72 people have been killed by Hezbollah rocket and drone attacks, including 30 soldiers, according to the prime minister's office. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, called for 'immediate international pressure' to end the war with Israel, protect civilians and medical teams from attack, as well as the country’s cultural heritage, the National News Agency reported Monday. Israel has conducted repeated airstrikes over the ancient cities of Tyre and Baalbek, risking damage to their ancient ruins. Mikati also discussed the situation with the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the U.N Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — as well as the European Union. In neighboring Syria, the state news agency reported an Israeli airstrike on a southern suburb of Damascus, saying it caused material damage but no casualties. The Israeli military said its air force struck Hezbollah targets belonging to the group's intelligence headquarters in Syria. In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed at least a dozen Palestinians on Monday in the northern town of Beit Lahiya, which has come under renewed intensive Israeli assault in the last month. Israel says Hamas militants are regrouping in northern Gaza, and they have issued evacuation orders for the remaining residents and have stepped up assaults on Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The area’s hospitals have also come under fire and only three are still partially functioning. 'Indonesian hospital is not functional anymore; Kamal Adwan and al Awda are minimally functional,' Rik Peeperkorn, World Health Organization representative in the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters in a video call from Gaza on Monday. He said if a planned WHO mission later this week is not allowed, al Awda would also 'very quickly' go out of service. The United Nations has repeatedly said it faces obstacles from Israel in delivering aid, especially in northern Gaza. Peeperkorn said there were very few missions to the north in October across U.N. agencies — they 'got canceled, got impeded, got delayed.' Currently, private imports are 'virtually banned' and Israeli authorities are allowing the use of only three crossing points into Gaza — Kerem Shalom, Gate 96 (near central Gaza) and Erez West. 'Furthermore, humanitarian colleagues can only access these border areas by highly dangerous routes,' said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. 'The use of most roads leading to these entry points has either been banned by the Israeli authorities or rendered unsafe due to the ongoing hostilities.' He said the routes available are often in poor condition and prone to looting by armed men. The United Nations is also in the final phase of a massive polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, where the disease has been detected in wastewater. Peeperkorn said the goal is to vaccinate nearly 600,000 children under age 10 across the territory. Teams have reached more than 95% coverage in south and central Gaza, and in the first two days of vaccinations in northern Gaza they reached nearly 95,000 children, or about 79% of their target. Israel cancels UNRWA Israel’s foreign ministry said Monday that the country formally notified the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, once new Israeli legislation goes into effect early next year. The move follows the Israeli parliament’s approval of legislation severing ties with the agency and banning it from operating in Israel. 'Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the U.N. that substantiate Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the U.N. did nothing to rectify the situation,' Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement. Israel has long been critical of UNRWA and has accused some of its staff of taking part in the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel has provided little evidence to support its claims, and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said last week that the agency has received no response to its repeated requests for Israel to provide such information. Where it has received evidence, it has acted. UNRWA is the main distributor of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where virtually the entire population needs humanitarian assistance. Israel’s letter to the U.N. says the country 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security.' 'If the law is fully implemented and the Israeli government makes it impossible for UNRWA to operate, this will have no effect on Israel's responsibility to provide for the population,' U.N. spokesperson Dujarric said. He noted that UNRWA is continuing to operate in Gaza. A group of about 50 countries led by Turkey has sent a letter to the president of the U.N. General Assembly calling for a halt in arms and munitions transfers to Israel where there are reasonable grounds to suspect they will be used against the Palestinians. 'We urge all necessary steps to be taken without delay to this end,' the letter says. Israel’s envoy dismissed the move as 'another ridiculous move by the Axis of Evil to act against Israel in the international arena.' The letter is signed by, among others, Turkey, the Palestinian Authority, Brazil, China, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Russia, and both the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

Analysts: North Korea's ties with Russia elevate danger to itself	washington — Pyongyang may have bet all its chips on its relationship with Moscow by committing the lives of its soldiers to fight for Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine, according to analysts. North Korean soldiers are gearing up for an anticipated battle in the Russian border region of Kursk. According to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine on Saturday, more than 7,000 North Korean soldiers in the front line near the border were armed with various weapons by Russia. They included 60 mm mortars, AK-12 rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Some North Korean soldiers in the region have already come under fire, according to a message that Andriy Kovalenko, the head of the Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation, posted on Telegram on Monday. The U.S. estimates that 8,000 soldiers are in the Kursk Oblast to fight in front-line operations against Ukraine forces in the coming days. 'There is no more significant and long-term a commitment one country can make to another than sending troops at wartime,' Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department and Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told VOA. 'I never believed this was short term, at least from the North Korean perspective,' said Cha, who formerly served as the deputy head of the U.S. delegation to the Six Party Talks with North Korea. Cha added that Kim could face many risks by deploying troops thousands of miles away from home and exposing them to fight alongside Russian soldiers. 'What if North Korean soldiers desert or are captured? What is the future of DPRK-Europe relations? What if South Korean weapons [supplied via the U.S to Ukraine thus far] kills North Korean soldiers? What if Ukraine makes a point of targeting North Korean soldiers for propaganda purposes?' he asked. Long-term commitment Cha, in an article CSIS published October 23, said that by sending troops, North Korea may have crossed the point of no return in its ties with Russia. South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun said during a news conference in Washington, held last week after a security meeting, that Seoul is looking to send a team to Ukraine to monitor North Korean troops. When Kim visited Russia last year and began sending munitions the same year, some analysts saw him as largely engaged in a short-term transactional relationship with Moscow. But after North Korea deployed troops to Russia — a move in line with a mutual defense treaty the two signed this summer — and joined Moscow’s war efforts against Ukraine and, by default, against NATO and U.S. interests, Kim is viewed as engaged in an 'all-in' relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin that comes with major risks. Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea, said, 'Kim Jong Un’s willingness to take these risks suggests he is ‘all in’ on the relationship with Moscow and prepared to make important sacrifices to show support for his Russian patron, in the hope that doing so will yield the benefits he seeks.' Revere added, 'This tells us a lot about what Kim is prepared to do to receive key military and space technologies. It remains to be seen whether Moscow is prepared to provide all the technologies and support Kim wants. If it does not, it will leave the North Korean ruler in a very difficult position.' South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell held talks Monday in Seoul and condemned North Korea’s troop deployment and possible military technology transfers Russia could make in return. North Korea launched a Hwasong-19 intercontinental ballistic missile Thursday in demonstration of what it described as the 'world’s most powerful strategic deterrent.' In addition to technologies Kim might want to further advance Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, North Korea will receive about $200 million from Moscow for its troop deployment, according to an estimate from South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. 'North Korea is not necessarily wanting to back away from the relationship at the moment because it’s given a lifeline as well as a hedge partner against China,' said Samuel Ramani, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Kim is 'willing to commit almost anything that Putin is willing to ask him to do at this point,' Ramani said. Transactional relationship Whether long term or short term, Dan DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, said, 'Ties are still very much transactional in the sense that Kim expects Russian President Vladimir Putin to compensate him in some way, shape or form.' However, DePetris said, 'it’s unlikely North Korea will be comfortable putting all its chips in Russia’s basket,' as 'betting on Russia over the long term would mean handcuffing North Korea to a single power, limiting the flexibility North Korean officials seek to maintain and giving Russia the ability to blackmail North Korea in the future.' North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said Friday, when she met in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that Pyongyang would fully back Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine until victory. Choe also said Kim had already 'instructed' North Korean officials to provide support for the Russian army 'without regard to anyone' when Russia launched what she described as 'the special military operation' against Ukraine in 2022. In return, Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow’s 'full support for North Korea’s measures aimed at countering the aggressive policies of the U.S. and its partners' and its commitment to implement the mutual defense treaty. 'We’ve long thought of North Korea as a rogue state, but the tight cooperation between Putin and Kim Jong Un now makes Russia look like a rogue state, too,' said Stephen Sestanovich, senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union from 1997 to 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-north-korea-s-ties-with-russia-elevate-danger-to-itself-/7851643.html	2024-11-04T17:10:27-08:00	
UAE opens its annual oil and gas summit as industry weathers Mideast wars and awaits US election	abu dhabi, united arab emirates — The United Arab Emirates opened its annual oil-and-gas summit on Monday as it plans to increase the country's energy output as global prices stay volatile and world politics remain uncertain ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The massive Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference comes after the UAE just last year hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels — the first time the conference made that crucial pledge. But the UAE as a whole still plans to increase its production capacity of oil to 5 million barrels a day in the coming years as it pursues cleaner energies at home. Meanwhile, UAE officials have made a point to dodge any questions about the U.S. election while maintaining their close ties to Russia despite Moscow's war on Ukraine. 'Allow me to say that we in the United Arab Emirates will always choose partnership over polarization, dialogue over division and peace over provocation,' said Sultan al-Jaber, who heads the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or ADNOC, and who also led the COP28 talks in Dubai. Crude oil prices have been depressed this year. Benchmark Brent crude traded around $74 a barrel on Monday as prices have dropped after concerns over the ongoing Mideast wars growing into a regional conflict faded in recent days. Slowing economic growth in China and ample supply in the market are additionally dragging down prices. In his speech opening the summit, al-Jaber pointed to artificial intelligence as a future technology that could be deployed by the energy industry — and one with a voracious appetite for electricity. 'No single source of energy is going to be enough to meet this demand,' he said. He called for a variety of energy sources to meet that challenge, including fossil fuels. 'Oil will continue to be used for fuel and as a building block for many essential products,' al-Jaber added. Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world's emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times. The 2015 Paris Agreement mentions that limit without specifically calling for a stop on using fossil fuels — something that OPEC Secretary-General Haitham al-Ghais seized on in remarks. 'The Paris Agreement, ladies and gentlemen, is about the reduction of emissions,' he said. 'It's not about phasing out or phasing down or keeping the oil under the ground.' Suhail al-Mazrouei, the Emirates' minister of energy and infrastructure, separately stressed that 'investments in oil and gas need to be taken care of' to support demand in the market. 'We are committed to invest in making more resources in the future to ensure the world will have adequate oil and gas resources,' he said. Hardeep Singh Puri, India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, separately made a point to criticize what he described as his 'ideologically motivated colleagues' who sought an end to fossil fuel production. 'As we accelerate other green energy transition, we will still need affordable traditional energy at least for two decades, if not longer,' he said. Politics was also close at hand at the summit on Monday. Whispers among the crowd attending the opening pondered who would be better for their businesses, Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Al-Mazrouei dodged the first question by a presenter over whether his country preferred Trump or Harris. 'Of course, we will be discussing energy politics here and I [would] rather not ... talk about the election in the United States,' al-Mazrouei said. 'As a political contest, we wish both candidates the best.' Later, ADNOC executive Musabbeh al-Kaabi said he worried that 'escalating tensions and trade wars may have an impact on the energy transition going forward.' However, he declined to comment directly on the election. The UAE maintains close ties to Russia despite Western sanctions over Moscow's war. An announcer told the crowd where to find Russian translation for the event, while one of the main partners of the summit was Lukoil, Russia's largest non-state oil firm. Meanwhile, the Mideast wars remain a top concern. 'I think the conflict in the Middle East is probably the top risk,' U.K.-based BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said. 'We're worried about the safety and security of our people and the security of energy flows.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uae-opens-its-annual-oil-and-gas-summit-as-industry-weathers-mideast-wars-and-awaits-us-election-/7851659.html	2024-11-04T17:02:04-08:00	
Philippine military drills to seize an island in the South China Sea	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine military opened two weeks of combat drills Monday that will include seizing an island in the disputed South China Sea and likely be frowned upon by China. More than 3,000 Filipino army, navy and air force personnel will take part in the maneuvers, which Philippine military officials said were not directed against any country. China has rapidly expanded its military and has become increasingly assertive in pursuing territorial claims in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. The tensions have led to more frequent confrontations, primarily with the Philippines and Vietnam, though the longtime territorial disputes also involve Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan. Last month, Indonesia said its patrol ships drove away a Chinese coast guard ship that disrupted a survey being undertaken by a state-owned energy company in a part of the South China Sea disputed by both countries. 'Our mission today is very clear, to prepare ourselves comprehensively to respond to any external threats that might challenge our sovereignty,' Armed Forces of the Philippines chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. said in the opening ceremony of the exercises. The maneuvers will include live-fire drills using artillery and assault rifles and beach landing drills. In the South China Sea, Filipino forces would simulate taking control of an island, Philippine army Colonel Michael Logico told reporters without elaborating. Asked how China may react, Logico said he expected Chinese forces to undertake surveillance from a distance but added they would not likely make any hostile move. 'They have a front seat to the exercise. They'll watch and we don't mind,' Logico said. China has opposed such combat drills in the South China Sea, particularly if American and allied forces were involved. The outgoing Biden administration has moved to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan. America's moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defense amid a long-seething dispute mainly with China in the South China Sea. Next year, U.S. and Philippines forces plan to stage their largest annual combat drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, that are also expected to include maneuvers in contested South China Sea areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-military-drills-to-seize-an-island-in-the-south-china-sea/7851656.html	2024-11-04T16:54:28-08:00	
US aiming for hack-proof election	Washington — Countries aiming to undermine Tuesday’s U.S. elections are being forced to rely on faked videos and other disinformation because they are unable to penetrate systems that could alter the actual tally of the vote, according to the latest assessment by the U.S. agency responsible for election security. Officials at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, said late Monday that with less than 24 hours before polls open on Election Day, there is no evidence to suggest foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China have the wherewithal to infiltrate and manipulate the country’s election infrastructure. 'I can say with great confidence that I do not believe that a technical hack of our elections in the way that it would materially impact the presidential election is possible,' said CISA Director Jen Easterly. 'Given the multiple layers of safeguards, the cybersecurity protections, the physical access controls, the pre-election testing of equipment for accuracy, the postelection audits, it would not be possible for a bad actor to tamper with or manipulate our voting systems in such a way that it would have a material impact on the outcome of the presidential election, certainly not without being detected,' Easterly told reporters. Some of the confidence stems from the decentralized way U.S. elections are run — with each state using its own, individual system to record and tally ballots. But it also follows years of preparation by CISA, working with state and local election officials across the United States. Those efforts have included more than 700 cybersecurity assessments, and hundreds of election exercises and training sessions since the start of 2023. Additionally, none of the state voting systems are connected to the internet, and an estimated 97% of U.S. voters will be casting ballots in jurisdictions that produce paper records as a backup. 'Our election infrastructure has never been more secure,' Easterly said. 'The election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free and fair elections.' As of late Monday, CISA estimated that more than 77 million Americans had already cast ballots during the early voting period, with tens of millions more expected to vote in person on Election Day. Yet while most votes have been cast without issue, organizations representing state election officials cautioned there are likely to be some disruptions. 'As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues may arise,' according to the National Association of State Election Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State. 'Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy periods, or an area could lose power,' they said in a statement. 'These are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.' There have also been other efforts to try to derail the election. CISA said it has observed 'small scale incidents,' including efforts to take down official election websites with distributed denial of service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to ballot drop boxes. 'We expect that these types of incidents and other forms of disruptions will continue on Election Day [and] in the days that follow,' Easterly told reporters. But she added that despite those disruptions, there has been 'no significant impacts to election infrastructure.' Instead, the bigger concern is what U.S. officials have described as 'a firehose of disinformation,' much of it blamed on Russia, Iran and China. A declassified U.S. assessment issued just two weeks before the election warned those three countries 'remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests.' Russia, Iran and China have repeatedly rejected the allegations. But U.S. officials and cybersecurity analysts argue there is ample proof. U.S. intelligence agencies have already attributed responsibility for some social media videos to Russian influence actors — including one claiming to show Haitian immigrants voting multiple times, and another purporting to show ballots in Pennsylvania being ripped up. And the FBI has likewise denounced additional videos pretending to be from the bureau as fakes. Separately, tech giant Microsoft last week identified a Chinese cyber campaign targeting Republican lawmakers and candidates seen as critical to Beijing. And U.S. intelligence has previously pointed to Iranian efforts to hack the campaign of former President Donald Trump. Gauging the effectiveness of these efforts, especially the recent videos attributed to Russia, is difficult to determine. 'The successfulness, I would say, is quite small,' said Brian Liston, a senior threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future’s Insikt Group. 'We have not really seen these videos, or this content break out beyond social media or on Telegram,' Liston told VOA. There are concerns, however, that some of these narratives could gain traction on more mainstream social media platforms, like X and Meta. 'Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and gutted content moderation and really changed the purpose of X, we've seen it become just a hotbed of mis and disinformation,' said Audrey McCabe, an information accountability analyst at Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and advocacy organization. McCabe told reporters Monday that the changes to X have rippled across the social media space. '[It] has allowed other platforms to lower their standards for content moderation and what they're doing to protect users,' she said. 'And so, we're seeing an increase of this stuff everywhere, including on Meta, and other platforms as well.' And with voters going to the polls Tuesday, there are concerns that the threat environment could worsen. The latest U.S. intelligence assessment, for example, warned that both Russia and Iran are likely to use their influence operations to incite violence, especially in the hours and days after the voting ends. 'They are deliberately finding narratives to try to stoke partisan discord and inflame domestic tension and pit Americans against one another, and we cannot let them succeed,' a senior CISA official said, who briefed reporters last Friday on the condition of anonymity. 'We've seen how these disinformation campaigns have led to very real threats of violence targeting these public servants, and that should be unacceptable,' the official added, citing repeated threats against election officials across the country. CISA’s Easterly said Monday that state and local election officials have been in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and that precautions have been put in place. She and other CISA officials also emphasized that so far, there have been no credible or specific threats to polling locations. 'We've not seen specific reporting about violence at polling places,' Easterly said in response to a question from VOA. 'I certainly don't want voters to feel at all intimidated about going to voting locations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aiming-for-hack-proof-election/7851626.html	2024-11-04T16:11:42-08:00	
China files complaint at WTO over EU tariffs on Chinese EVs	GENEVA — China has moved forward with a complaint at the World Trade Organization that alleges the European Union has improperly set anti-subsidy tariffs on new Chinese-made electric vehicles. The Chinese diplomatic mission to the WTO said Monday it 'strongly opposes' the measures and insisted its move was designed to protect the EV industry and support a global transition toward greener technologies. The European bloc announced last month it was imposing import duties of up to 35% on electric vehicles from China, alleging the Chinese exports were unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. The duties are set to remain in force for five years, unless an amicable deal can be struck. Electric vehicles have become a major flashpoint in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. China alleged that the EU move amounted to 'an abuse of trade remedies' that violates WTO rules, and amounted to 'protectionist' measures, according to the mission's statement. Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive vice president of the EU's Commission, last week called the steps 'proportionate and targeted' and were aimed to underpin fair market practices and support the bloc's industrial base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-files-complaint-at-wto-over-eu-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-/7851619.html	2024-11-04T16:00:47-08:00	
Remains of nearly 30 Civil War veterans found in funeral home's storage are laid to rest	PAWTUCKET, R.I. — For several decades, the cremated remains of more than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage facilities at a funeral home and cemetery in Seattle. The simple copper and cardboard urns gathering dust on shelves only had the name of each of the 28 soldiers — but nothing linking them to the Civil War. Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving of a burial service with military honors. 'It's amazing that they were still there and we found them,' said Tom Keating, the Washington state coordinator for the Missing in America Project, which turned to a team of volunteers to confirm their war service through genealogical research. 'It's something long overdue. These people have been waiting a long time for a burial.' Most of the veterans were buried in August at Washington's Tahoma National Cemetery. In a traditional service offered to Civil War veterans, the historical 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment dressed in Union uniforms fired musket volleys and the crowd sang 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic.' Names were called out for each veteran and their unit before their remains were brought forward and stories were shared about their exploits. Then, they were buried. Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch -- which he kept until his death — and another deserted the Confederate Army and joined the Union forces. 'It was something, just the finality of it all,' Keating said, adding they were unable to find any living descendants of the veterans. While some remains are hidden away in funeral homes, others were found where they fell in battle or by Civil War re-enactors combing old graveyards. Communities often turn reburials into major events, allowing residents to celebrate veterans and remember a long-forgotten war. In 2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college's football stadium were reburied in 2005. Sometimes reburials spark controversy. The discovery of the remains of two soldiers from the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia prompted an unsuccessful attempt in 2018 by several families to have DNA tests done on them. The Army rejected that request and reburied them as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. Along with those buried at Tahoma, Keating said, several others will be buried at Washington State Veterans Cemetery and a Navy veteran will be buried at sea. The remains of several more Civil War veterans were sent to Maine, Rhode Island and other places where family connections were found. Among them was Byron Johnson. Born in Pawtucket in 1844, he enlisted at 18 and served as a hospital steward with the Union Army. He moved out West after the war and died in Seattle in 1913. After his remains were delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at his family's plot in Oak Grove Cemetery. Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson's burial service was the right thing to do. 'When you have somebody who served in a war but especially this war, we want to honor them,' he said. 'It became more intriguing when you think this individual was left out there and not buried in his own community.' Grebien said the burials recall important lessons about the 1861-1865 war to preserve the Union, fought between the North's Union Army and the Confederate States of America at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. 'It was important to remind people not only in Pawtucket but the state of Rhode Island and nationwide that we have people who sacrificed their lives for us and for a lot of the freedoms we have,' he said. Bruce Frail and his son Ben — both long active in the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War — were on hand for service. Ben Frail was also a re-enactor at Johnson's service, portraying a Union Army captain. 'It's the best thing we can do for a veteran,' said Bruce Frail, a former commander-in-chief with the Sons of Union Veterans and state coordinator for Missing in America Project. 'The feeling that you get when you honor somebody in that way, it's indescribable,' he said. The task of piecing together Johnson's life story was left to Amelia Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor's office. A history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work and Johnson's story became the talk of City Hall. She determined Johnson grew up in Pawtucket, had two sisters and a brother and worked as a druggist after the war. He left to make his fortune out West, first in San Francisco and eventually in Seattle, where he worked nearly up until his death. It doesn't appear Johnson ever married or had children, and no living relatives were found. 'I felt like it was resolution of sorts,' Boivin said. 'It felt like we were doing right for someone who otherwise would have been lost to history.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7851351.html	2024-11-04T15:47:17-08:00	
Russia to launch two Iranian satellites Tuesday, Tehran's Moscow envoy says	Russia will launch two Iranian satellites into orbit using a Soyuz launcher on Tuesday, Iran's ambassador to Moscow said Monday, as the two U.S.-sanctioned countries deepen their scientific relationship. 'In continuation of the development of Iran-Russia scientific and technological cooperation, two Iranian satellites, Kowsar and Hodhod, will be launched to a 500 km orbit of Earth,' Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali said in a post on X. The development of Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a small communications satellite, is the first substantial effort by Iran's private space sector, a report by Iran's semiofficial news agency Tasnim said last month. Russia launched an Iranian research-sensing satellite, Pars 1, into space in February using a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-launch-two-iranian-satellites-tuesday-tehran-s-moscow-envoy-says-/7851354.html	2024-11-04T15:45:06-08:00	
Iran executes Jewish citizen convicted of murder	tehran, iran — Iran on Monday executed a Jewish citizen convicted of murdering another man in 2022 following a personal dispute, reports said. It was a rare case of an execution of member of a religious minority in the predominately Muslim nation. Mizanonline.ir, a website affiliated with Iran's judiciary, said 23-year-old Arvin Ghahremani was put to death after the country's Supreme Court affirmed the capital punishment handed down in the case earlier last year. The report quoted Hamid Reza Karimi, the prosecutor of the western city of Kermanshah, as saying the court and the convicted man's lawyers and relatives had failed to convince the victim's family to abstain from qisas — an act under Islamic penal code that calls for similar punishment, or an 'eye for an eye' — and effectively pardon his killer. The victim's name was not provided. According to the report, Ghahramani attacked the victim outside a gym in Kermanshah in 2022 and stabbed the man several times following a dispute over money he had loaned the victim. Jewish citizens are a small minority in the country of 85 million. In 1999, Iran arrested 13 Jewish citizens, accusing them of spying for Israel and sentenced several to up to four years in prison. Many Jews fled the country after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and current estimates suggest some 20,000 Jews remain in Iran. Shiite Muslims make up most of Iran's population and the establishment is led by hard-line clerics who preach a strict version of Islam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-executes-a-jewish-citizen-convicted-of-murder-/7851349.html	2024-11-04T15:44:44-08:00	
Russia, Indonesia begin unprecedented naval drills	Indonesia and Russia began their first-ever joint naval exercises Monday in the Java Sea. These bilateral drills work to support an Indonesian foreign policy agenda that prioritizes nonalignment in the face of conflict between world powers. The drills have been divided into two phases and will take place over the course of five days near Indonesia's Surabaya city, east of the capital, Jakarta. In the beginning 'harbor phase,' Indonesia and Russia have focused on increasing naval interoperability through ship tours and simulation games, according to a press release from the Indonesian navy. Russia sent three corvette-class warships, a medium tanker ship, a military helicopter unit and a tugboat to the archipelago. Indonesia participated in military drills in 2021 with Russia as a member of the ASEAN bloc, but this marks the first time that the two countries have engaged independently. The bilateral drills come as Indonesia’s newly elected President Prabowo Subianto doubles down on Indonesia’s commitment to nonalignment in foreign affairs, seeking to pursue relationships with all countries, regardless of ideological differences. Prabowo, the country’s former defense minister, visited Russia in July, where he expressed wishes to deepen the bilateral relationship and increase defense collaboration, extending an invitation to Indonesia’s defense exposition this month. 'We consider Russia as a great friend, and I would like to continue to maintain and enhance this relationship,' Prabowo told Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian ambassador to Indonesia, Sergey Tolchenov, said Monday that the drills were not aimed at any country and could 'ensure security and stability in the region,' Reuters reported. Outside of Russia, Indonesia has looked to further defense collaboration with other countries, including the United States and China. In August, just before participating in the U.S.-led, multinational Super Garuda Shield exercises, Indonesia and China agreed to resume joint military exercises after a nine-year suspension.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-indonesia-begin-unprecedented-naval-drills/7851339.html	2024-11-04T15:18:29-08:00	
Pennsylvania judge: Musk's $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes can proceed	PHILADELPHIA — The $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes that Elon Musk 's political action committee is hosting in swing states can continue through Tuesday's presidential election, a Pennsylvania judge ruled Monday. Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta — ruling after Musk's lawyers said the winners are not chosen by chance — did not immediately give a reason for the ruling. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner had called the sweepstakes a scam that violates state election law and asked that it be shut down. The winners of the sweepstakes did not win by chance but are instead paid spokespeople for the group, Musk's lawyers said in court Monday. Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two recipients before Tuesday's presidential election will be in Arizona on Monday and Michigan on Tuesday. 'The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,' Gober said Monday. 'We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.' Chris Young, the director of America PAC, testified that the recipients are vetted ahead of time, to 'feel out their personality, (and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned' with the group. The disclosures prompted a lawyer for District Attorney Larry Krasner to call the effort a 'scam' that is 'designed to actually influence a national election.' Musk's lawyers, in closing arguments, called it 'core political speech' given that participants sign a petition endorsing the U.S. Constitution. They said Krasner's legal bid to shut down the sweepstakes under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday. Krasner believes the giveaways violates state election law and contradict what Musk promised when he announced them during an appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 's campaign in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: 'We're going to be awarding a million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,' Musk vowed. Young also acknowledged that the PAC made the recipients sign nondisclosure agreements. 'They couldn't really reveal the truth about how they got the money, right?' asked Krasner lawyer John Summers. 'Sounds right,' Young said. In an Oct. 20 social media post shown in court, Musk said anyone signing the petition had 'a daily chance of winning $1M!' Summers grilled him on Musk's use of both the words 'chance' and 'randomly,' prompting Young, who also serves as the PAC's treasurer, to concede the latter was not 'the word I would have selected.' Young said the winners knew they would be called on stage but not specifically that they would win the money. Musk did not attend the hearing. He has committed more than $70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November. 'This was all a political marketing masquerading as a lottery,' Krasner testified Monday morning. 'That's what it is. A grift.' Lawyers for Musk and the PAC said they do not plan to extend the lottery beyond Tuesday. Krasner said the first three winners, starting on Oct. 19, came from Pennsylvania in the days leading up to the state's Oct. 21 voter registration deadline. Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. It's not clear if anyone has yet received the money. The PAC pledged they would get it by Nov. 30, according to an exhibit shown in court. More than 1 million people from the seven states have registered for the sweepstakes by signing a petition saying they support the right to free speech and to bear arms, the first two amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Krasner questioned how the PAC might use their data, which it will have on hand well past the election. 'They were scammed for their information,' Krasner said. 'It has almost unlimited use.' Krasner's lawyer, John Summers, said Musk is 'the heartbeat of America PAC,' and the person announcing the winners and presenting the checks. 'He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard checks. We don't really know if there are any real checks,' Summers said. Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta was presiding over the case at Philadelphia City Hall after Musk and the PAC lost an effort to move it to federal court. Krasner has said he could still consider criminal charges, as he's tasked with protecting both lotteries and the integrity of elections. In the lawsuit, he said the defendants are 'indisputably violating' Pennsylvania's lottery laws. Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state with 19 electoral votes and both Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris have repeatedly visited the state, including stops planned Monday in the final hours of the campaign. Krasner — who noted that he has long driven a Tesla — said he could also seek civil damages for the Pennsylvania registrants. Musk is the CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla. He also owns the social media platform X, where America PAC has published posts on the sweepstakes, and the rocket ship maker SpaceX.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pennsylvania-judge-musk-s-1-million-a-day-voter-sweepstakes-can-proceed/7851311.html	2024-11-04T14:51:21-08:00	
US arrests Turkish businessman accused of helping Venezuela skirt sanctions	miami — A Turkish businessman was arrested Monday in Miami and charged with helping Venezuela's state-run oil company circumvent U.S. sanctions. Taskin Torlak, 37, was arrested while attempting to return to Turkey, the Justice Department said in a statement. According to court documents, Torlak operated several companies involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil. Starting in 2020, he allegedly started working with unnamed co-conspirators and companies from Ukraine, China, Indonesia and elsewhere to transport Venezuela's crude oil at a time when most Western buyers stayed clear of the South American country for fear of undermining U.S. sanctions aimed at removing President Nicolas Maduro. Torlak and his associates allegedly hid the identities of transaction beneficiaries to enable U.S. banks to unknowingly process payments related to the illegal oil transports. 'We could use one of the clean names to avoid money getting stuck somewhere,' he allegedly wrote in communications with one of the co-conspirators. To evade detection, the chartered oil tankers frequently turned off their automated tracking systems, a mandatory safety device, when transporting the illegal Venezuelan crude. They also frequently changed the vessels' registry to fly so-called flags of convenience. It wasn't immediately possible to locate an attorney for Torlak. The U.S. started ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela following Maduro's first re-election in 2018, in which several key opponents were barred from running. Since then, the self-declared socialist leader has deepened his grip on power, this year claiming he won a third six-year term in the face of evidence presented by his opponents that the vote was stolen. The U.S. responded with another round of sanctions against officials accused of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. 'The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those involved in criminal efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed on the Maduro regime,' Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-arrests-turkish-businessman-accused-of-helping-venezuela-skirt-sanctions-/7851307.html	2024-11-04T14:49:36-08:00	
At UN, US confronts Russia over North Korean troops for Ukraine	New York — Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine, during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N. Security Council. 'I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in Russia,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members, using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name. 'And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation will answer that simple question,' he said. Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming days. 'We're not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,' said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva. U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations. 'The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in front line operations,' he said. South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a 'more desperate and dangerous' way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links between the two neighbors. 'And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own people by dispatching troops to Russia,' said Ambassador JoonKook Hwang. William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North Korean troops are. 'And we don't know how they will react when faced in combat positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,' he said. 'So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.' Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to economic or other support. 'North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,' Naoko Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. 'And this is a little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development, for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.' She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula. On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions that Russia previously voted for. Ballistic missile launch The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30 missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 'The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,' Japan’s ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. 'This ICBM launch is more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000 kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched to date.' He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from North Korea. North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as 'unlawful' and interference in its domestic affairs. 'Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard security of our state as well peace of the region involved,' said Ambassador Kim Song. Russia sides with North Korea 'The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet another step towards demonizing the DPRK,' said Ambassador Evstigneeva. She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula because of its recent military exercises with South Korea. South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch and strongly condemned it. 'Its intention could be to distract the world's attention from its troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,' said Ambassador Hwang. 'Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,' he said. VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-us-confronts-russia-over-north-korean-troops-for-ukraine/7851266.html	2024-11-04T13:39:44-08:00	
Pakistan's parliament extends army chief's term amid opposition outcry	Islamabad — Pakistan’s ruling coalition lawmakers approved a series of bills Monday that extend the terms of the heads of the armed forces, including the military, from three years to five years, despite noisy opposition protests. The legislative action ensures that Army Chief General Asim Munir, who has been in office for two years, will continue to lead the country’s powerful military at least until November 2027. The parliamentary proceedings, telecast live, witnessed disruptive protests from lawmakers of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by the imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, with some of them tearing up copies of the bills and throwing them at the house speaker. PTI members argued that the government hastily approved key constitutional amendments without allowing for proper debate, calling the move detrimental to an already fragile democracy in Pakistan. They reiterated their complaints about the ongoing government crackdown on party workers and demanded Khan's release, asserting that he is being jailed on false charges. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government dismissed PTI’s claims as politically motivated. 'Pakistan’s parliament has pushed through a bill extending the army chief’s tenure from 3 to 5 years, and with little debate,' Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Center, said on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 'The most powerful post in Pakistan is poised to become even more powerful. When a legislature is reduced to a rubber stamp, democracy is never a winner,' Kugelman wrote. Sharif took power after general elections in February, which Khan and his party allege were rigged by the military leadership to keep them out of power. Election officials and the army reject the allegations. Khan, cricket star-turned-prime minister, was removed from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022. The 72-year-old deposed leader was jailed in August 2023 over controversial allegations of corruption and inciting violence against the military, among dozens of other charges. Khan rejects all the lawsuits as fabrications by the military, accusing Munir’s predecessor, former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, of orchestrating the downfall of his government. The former prime minister has led a defiant campaign against the military while his party continues to protest in parliament and on the streets, demanding the return of their 'stolen mandate.' Last month, more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners in Pakistan. The American lawmakers expressed concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in the South Asian nation. Without naming Sharif’s coalition government, the letter stated that 'Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.’' Islamabad hit back at the letter, saying it is based on 'an incorrect understanding of the political situation in Pakistan.' Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are frequently accused of influencing the rise or fall of elected governments through election rigging and pro-army political parties. Army generals have staged three coups against elected governments and ruled the South Asian nation for over three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Pakistani politicians, including Khan and several of his predecessors, have publicly stated that military generals influence policy-making even when they are not in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-parliament-extends-army-chief-term-amid-opposition-outcry/7851242.html	2024-11-04T13:26:51-08:00	
What does Harris mean by an opportunity economy?	As U.S. voters remain largely dissatisfied with the economy under President Joe Biden, Kamala Harris has sought to define her own economic policy under the label of an opportunity economy. But what does that term mean, and how different is it than what Biden has offered? Among many contentious topics influencing the 2024 election, the economy remains the number one issue for a majority of voters. With Americans reporting feeling worse off financially despite positive economic trends, Vice President Harris has sought to distinguish her own economic platform from that of the administration in which she currently serves. President Biden’s economic platform has been characterized by support for unions and American industries, efforts to cancel student debt and attempts to pass major disaster recovery and infrastructure packages. Harris has aimed to build on these policies while doing more to address concerns over rising prices due to inflation, and her economic program has focused largely on ways to lower costs for Americans. These proposals include a ban on price-gouging, a price cap on prescription drugs and subsidizing the construction of new homes in hopes that increasing supply will help stem rising housing costs. Harris has also sought to make the case to voters that tariffs proposed by her rival, former President Donald Trump, will exacerbate price increases as companies pass higher import costs on to consumers. However, the vice president has also proposed tariffs in strategic industries such as energy and is likely to retain tariffs on Chinese goods maintained under the Biden administration. The Harris campaign’s frequent references to an 'opportunity economy' combine the Democratic Party’s traditional support for social safety nets and consumer protection regulations with an entrepreneurial message usually associated with Republicans. Besides expanding the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, the vice president has echoed Trump’s proposal for eliminating taxes on tips earned by service workers. Harris has also announced plans to provide more loans for new small businesses and to ensure that historically disadvantaged groups can benefit economically from the growing legal cannabis industry. Harris’ California background and connections to Silicon Valley also suggest that she may be more friendly to the tech industry and the emerging cryptocurrency market. It remains to be seen whether a Harris administration would replace Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission and Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission – two Biden appointees known for their tough regulatory approach. The vice president’s economic plan has received a mixed reception. Many economists believe Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation may help spur economic growth, but a majority polled by The Wall Street Journal have predicted that Harris’ less aggressive trade policy will be better for curbing inflation and the deficit. When it comes to the general public, however, Harris is still perceived as less capable of handling the economy than Trump, although the margin of Trump’s advantage has shrunk as the election draws near.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-does-harris-mean-by-an-opportunity-economy-/7851119.html	2024-11-04T11:51:04-08:00	
Shards of IS Part 1: Forgotten children of Islamic State locked away in Syria	At 21 years old, Noah Soulay is a grown man. He is tall, slim and speaks English with an American accent. He says he lived in New York for some time as a child. He is now incarcerated in Syria. When he was 12, Soulay's stepfather brought him and his mother here from Trinidad and Tobago to join Islamic State. At the height of its power, the militant group held land that was roughly the size of the United Kingdom in Syria and Iraq. IS's land-claim and the terror they inflicted on the world have faded into a bizarre chapter of history. But tens of thousands of its former members from dozens of countries remain imprisoned in northeastern Syria. Also locked away are about 30,000 of their children, many who have never known a day of freedom. 'Sometimes I feel like there's no hope, you know?' says Soulay. 'We are living for no reason. My life has no meaning.' Soulay has been imprisoned since he was captured at 16 years old, holding an AK-47 with men who appeared to be seasoned foreign militants. Initially, Kurdish regional authorities put him in an adult jail, but he was soon transferred to al-Houri Rehabilitation Center, which holds boys from IS families who have not been accused of crimes. Al-Houri is surrounded by thick concrete walls, topped with barbed wire and armed guards. It also has a school that teaches science, music, English and Arabic. It is nicer than the adult prisons in the region that we have seen, where men live packed in small, dirty rooms without fresh air, clean bathrooms, enough food or medical care. But it is a prison. 'If we put them in with adult prisoners they will be radicalized,' says a camp manager, who declines to give his name because he is afraid of being targeted by whoever killed another al-Houri manager two years ago. 'It's a big problem for us.' However, al-Houri is often filled well beyond capacity, and many boys are delivered to prison when they turn 18, regardless of the risk and the injustice. If they are Syrian, they may get a trial and may be released. Foreigners, however, are kept in jail indefinitely. The camp manager now, and others who held the job before, acknowledge that keeping children who have never been accused of crimes locked up is wrong. But they say the countries where the boys came from should retrieve their children. They don't know what else to do with them. The boys say they are deeply depressed and lonely. They never chose to be involved with IS. 'I don't know what's happening with me,' says Soulay. 'I just wake up every morning hoping that one day, someone's going to come and tell me: it's time to go home.' Childhoods erased The younger boys at al-Houri and rehabilitation centers like it were toddlers when they were brought to IS. Some have no memories of life before the militant group. When IS collapsed in 2019 at least 70,000 people fled the final brutal battle in Baghuz, Syria, including tens of thousands of children. I remember watching children stumble out of the military trucks that carried them from a war zone that hardened militants later told us was 'hell on earth.' The children were dirty, thin and bleary eyed. One boy answered a journalist's questions in a daze, saying his father was 'present.' When asked if that meant his father was present in this field, or present on the earth, he stared blankly. The children and their mothers were gathered onto trucks and brought to camps while the men were lined up and carted off to prison. In the years since, some of the foreign women and children were taken back by their home countries, and many Syrian families went home. But most of them still live in al-Hold and al-Roj camps, where the tents are cold, wet and muddy in the winter and sweltering hot in the summer. Sometimes there are schools for the children provided by aid workers, but periodically those schools are burnt down by women who object to the non-IS curriculum. 'We won't go to any infidel school,' Mohammed, 11, from Tajikistan, told us at al-Hol Camp, back in 2020. He later admitted he'd like to go to a school that teaches things like math and English. He just didn't want to be tricked into being a non-believer. Guards call the camp a 'ticking time bomb' because many residents are still IS ideologues. They believe that people they deem to be 'infidels' should be killed. In the past five years there have been at least 130 murders. I then took out a camera and Mohammed ducked behind Halan Akoiy, our translator. Mohammed later explained that at 11 years old, he was close to the age of being taken to prison. He didn't want the prison bosses to see his picture and come to get him. 'Why are they taking our boys to jail?' shouted Asma, a mother shopping in the nearby market stall. She was from Uzbekistan and overheard the conversation. 'What did they do?' Local officials are frank when asked why they snatch up boys as young as 12 and take them away from their families. According to the officials, without outside help, there is no other option. Otherwise, they say, the boys will become the next generation of militants. We asked Mohammed if children here want to grow up to be IS fighters. 'Some kids don't want to,' he answered. 'But 99% of us want this.' Who to blame? There is no plan to stop removing boys from their mothers, and guards say the detention system is expanding. Girls are left in the camps, also facing a lifetime of danger and degradation. Amnesty International says the separation of children from their mothers is unlawful and that conditions in the camps and prisons are inhumane and sometimes deadly. The vast majority of the men and women in the system have not been formally accused of a crime or tried in a court. Amnesty International blames the local Kurdish authorities—the Autonomous Authorities of the North and East Syria Region, which is made up of the civilian leadership, the Syrian Democratic Forces and other affiliated military groups. They also blame the United States, which backs the SDF. 'The U.S. government has played a central role in the creation and maintenance of this system,' says a report the organization published in April this year. Kurdish authorities are offended by the accusation that they are human rights abusers. They have spoken out countless times against the ill treatment of the IS detainees, saying they desperately need international help to solve what they say is an international problem. Dozens of countries took credit in the defeat of IS in Syria, but they have been left virtually alone to clean up the mess. There are detainees from more than 70 countries, and while some prisoners have been repatriated, most remain in Syria. 'We are suffering here in the camp,' says Khorsheed Haval, the al-Hol Camp Director, using a nickname for security reasons. 'Our funding has decreased to only 30% of what is needed. Our healthcare is bad and people are dying, but there is no place to treat them.' These officials say IS attacks never stopped after the group was defeated in battle, and they are once again a growing threat. Amnesty International says the danger is not limited to Syria. 'While the threat of IS remains real worldwide,' reads the April report. 'The violations ongoing in north-east Syria only entrench further grievances and mean a generation of children have known only systematic injustice. The autonomous authorities, members of the U.S.-led coalition, and the U.N. must act to remedy these violations and end the cycles of abuse and violence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7850595.html	2024-11-04T11:37:26-08:00

Serbian minister to resign over concrete canopy collapse that killed 14 people	belgrade, serbia — Serbia's construction minister said Monday he was stepping down days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and severely injuring three. Minister Goran Vesic announced his resignation at a hastily called press conference as anger mounted in the Balkan country over the fatal collapse that happened just before noon on Friday in the northern city of Novi Sad. Vesic's resignation needs to be confirmed in Serbia's parliament. 'I would like to inform you that I will formally submit my resignation tomorrow morning,' said Vesic. 'Once the parliament accepts it, I will no longer perform this duty.' Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Critics of Serbia's populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during the reconstruction. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of top officials, including President Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, accusing them of being responsible for the deadly accident. Opposition groups plan to hold a rally on Tuesday in Novi Sad and more protests later if their demands are not met. Vesic said that he does not accept any guilt for the deaths of the victims. 'I cannot accept guilt for the death of 14 people because neither I, nor the people who work with me, bear even a shred of responsibility for the tragedy that happened,'' he said. 'I urge the authorities to determine as soon as possible who was responsible for this tragedy.' The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Monday without improvement, doctors said. Populist officials have accused opposition parties of using the tragedy for political gains while pledging accountability. Vucic on Monday promised those responsible will be punished. 'I am certain that the state authorities will determine criminal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in our country,' said Vucic. Serbian prosecutors said they have already questioned more than 40 people — including Vesic — since opening the probe on Saturday. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not renovated. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964. The renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-minister-to-resign-over-concrete-canopy-collapse-that-killed-14-people-/7851070.html	2024-11-04T11:16:08-08:00	
Trump lawsuits, complaints target media in closing days of campaign	Washington — In the last week of the U.S. presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump sued CBS News and filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against The Washington Post newspaper. The cases are the latest high-profile conflicts between the former president and news outlets that he often accuses of bias. Trump sued CBS over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris on the network’s '60 Minutes' program that aired in early October. Trump had also agreed to give an interview to '60 Minutes' before backing out. Filed in Texas on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the network aired two different responses from Harris about the Israel-Hamas war. In a statement, CBS said '60 Minutes' gave an excerpt of the interview to the CBS show 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than what aired on '60 Minutes.' But Trump’s lawsuit — which calls for a jury trial and $10 billion in damages — alleges that CBS violated a Texas law that prohibits deceptive acts in the conduct of business. A CBS spokesperson told VOA the interview was not doctored. The lawsuit 'is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it,' the spokesperson said in an email. Trump on Thursday also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that The Washington Post illegally contributed to the Harris campaign. The complaint alleges a social media ad campaign highlighting the newspaper’s critical coverage of the former president constituted 'illegal corporate in-kind contributions and unreported last-minute independent expenditures.' Trump’s legal representatives allege the ad campaign meant the Post was 'acting like any other partisan player in the election process.' A Post spokesperson told VOA that promoted posts on social media reflect high-performing content from the newspaper 'We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is improper are without merit,' the spokesperson said in an email. Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, dismissed the case against the Post. 'Advertising by news organizations is a legitimate, routine press function and receives strong First Amendment protections in the courts,' he told VOA in a text message. Trump’s campaign and office did not reply to VOA’s multiple requests for comment on the recent legal actions or the former president’s press freedom record for this story. Power to revoke broadcasting licenses Trump has had a contentious relationship with some news outlets since running for president in 2015. Often referring to journalists as 'the enemy of the people,' he has complained on social media and in speeches about ideological bias and unfair treatment of conservative voices, while also championing media that reflect his views. He has pledged to jail journalists who do not name confidential sources on stories he believed to have national security implication, and suggested changing First Amendment protections to allow punishing people who burn the American flag or criticize Supreme Court judges. Trump had previously threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcast license if elected. On his social media platform, Truth Social, he said '60 Minutes' had 'created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History' and that CBS should lose its license because it is 'corrupt.' Following his September debate against Harris on ABC News, Trump called for that network’s broadcasting license to be revoked over what he described as 'unfair' fact-checking. And as president in 2017, Trump threatened to revoke NBC’s broadcasting license after the outlet reported a dispute between the then-president and his military advisers about the size of the nuclear arsenal. In an October statement, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, which issues licenses, said the FCC 'does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.' Many of Trump’s supporters applaud his attacks on the media, reflecting in part the steep erosion of trust in the press that public opinion polls have tracked among many Americans for years. But media analysts say Trump’s attacks echo how leaders in countries like Hungary have undermined journalistic norms. Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said the lawsuit against CBS 'looks like a publicity stunt.' But, he said, 'It reinforces the very real threats that Trump has issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn’t like should he regain the White House.' Leading up to and during his time as president, Trump published more than 2,000 posts on social media that the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker classified as anti-media. After Trump left the White House, his anti-media rhetoric has continued. Between September 1 and October 24, Trump verbally insulted, attacked or threatened the media at least 108 times in public, RSF found in a study. RSF has not conducted a similar study about Vice President Harris because she does not make those kinds of anti-media statements, Weimers said. 'By just accepting that as a piece of this political moment, I do think there’s a risk that the American public has grown numb to how serious it is, what an aberration it is, and how dangerous it could be going forward,' Weimers said in a phone interview. Trump’s public attacks against the media frequently play well with his supporters. At many of his rallies, the candidate often pauses after criticizing the media to give his supporters a chance to jeer at the reporters who are present. Last month, Trump’s presidential campaign sent VOA a statement that Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news site The Daily Caller. In it, Rogers described Trump as a 'champion for free speech' and said that 'everyone was safer under President Trump, including journalists' because of 'commonsense law.' Newspaper endorsements Record-low distrust in media in the U.S. is what billionaire and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos pointed to in an op-ed last week to explain why the newspaper would not make an endorsement in this year’s presidential election. Days before the Post’s announcement, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times said his newspaper would not endorse a candidate so as not to worsen political divisions. For some media analysts, the decisions by the Post and the Los Angeles Times have only crystallized concerns about what a second Trump presidency would mean for press freedom in the United States. Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said he thinks it would have been fine if the Post made this decision a year or two ago. But announcing the decision so close to the election was a 'betrayal of core principles of the Post,' Baron told VOA in a phone interview. 'This is an invitation to further intimidation and bullying, and I think that that’s what we would likely see if Trump were to be back in the White House,' Baron added. Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist with The Guardian who previously worked as a media columnist at the Post, said the decision does not reflect the newspaper’s ideals. 'This seemed to be a move from above that wasn’t about the content of the endorsement,' she told VOA in a phone interview. Baron and Sullivan told VOA they’re concerned that the non-endorsement is a harbinger of what’s to come for press freedom if Trump is re-elected. 'I’m very concerned about intimidation of the press,' Sullivan said. 'And frankly, I’m very concerned about the press preemptively acting like they’ve been intimidated when they have the ability to stand firm.' Both of Trump’s legal challenges against the Post and CBS are expected to take weeks or months before they reach a resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lawsuits-complaints-target-media-in-closing-days-of-campaign/7851069.html	2024-11-04T11:15:45-08:00	
Thousands rally again in Georgia to protest Oct. 26 parliamentary election they say was rigged	Tbilisi, Georgia — Thousands of opposition supporters rallied outside Georgia's parliament for the second straight Monday to denounce the Oct. 26 election as illegitimate after the ruling party was declared the winner amid allegations of vote-rigging helped by Russia. The protesters, who waved Georgian and European Union flags, demanded a new parliamentary election under international supervision and an investigation of the alleged ballot irregularities. Opposition leaders vowed to boycott sessions of parliament and hold regular protests until their demands are met. The protest took place under the watch of riot police, reflecting the simmering political tensions in the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million that lies between Russia and Turkey. The Central Election Commission said the ruling Georgian Dream party won about 54% of the vote. Its leaders have rejected the opposition claims of vote fraud. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, says Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Zourabichvili, who holds mostly ceremonial position, has urged the United States and EU support the demonstrations. Officials in Washington and Brussels have urged a full investigation of the election, while the Kremlin has rejected the accusations of interference. Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012, was established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. The opposition has accused it of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. It has recently adopted laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. European election observers said the election took place in a 'divisive' atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. Observers said instances of intimidation and other violations were particularly prevalent in rural areas. The EU suspended Georgia's membership application process indefinitely because of its passage in June of a Russian-style 'foreign influence law.' Many Georgians viewed the parliamentary election as a pivotal referendum on the country's effort to join the EU. Georgian Dream promised to continue pushing toward EU accession but it also wants to 'reset' ties with Russia, the country's former imperial master. In 2008, Georgia fought and lost a brief war with Moscow, which then recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions and bolstered its military presence there. Georgia's prosecutors last week launched an investigation of the alleged vote-rigging. The opposition immediately objected that the Prosecutor's Office would not conduct an independent investigation because its head was appointed by the Georgian Dream-controlled parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-rally-again-in-georgia-to-protest-oct-26-parliamentary-election-they-say-was-rigged/7851020.html	2024-11-04T10:44:51-08:00	
New president says Botswana's smooth transfer of power sets example	gabarone, botswana — Botswana’s newly elected leader, Duma Boko, says Africa can draw vital lessons from his country’s smooth transfer of power. Boko spoke after the Botswana Democratic Party, which had ruled the country since independence in 1966, suffered a crushing defeat in last week’s elections. Addressing the media after an official handover of office Monday, Boko praised outgoing President Mokgweetsi Masisi for ensuring a seamless transfer of power. Boko’s party, the Umbrella for Democratic Change, will form the next government. 'Botswana today, sends a message to the whole world and says democracy is alive here, democracy is in action,' Boko said. 'This is democracy in motion; this is democracy exemplified, sent as an abiding lesson to the whole world to say to the African continent — it must happen, it can happen and when it does, it is one of the most beautiful experiences a country can go through.' Masisi’s former ruling Botswana Democratic Party was soundly beaten, winning only four out of 61 National Assembly seats. Analysts blamed mounting economic grievances, particularly among young people, for the party’s downfall. The former president said he had a duty to ensure that the first change of government since 1966 was seamless. 'I knew I had a responsibility to make sure we set a standard, because we have never had a change of government as in a different party taking over in this country,' Masisi said. 'So the onerousness of the responsibility on me was massive and I had to lead.' Masisi, who served only one out of a possible two five-year terms, said he will not run for political office again. Piers Pigou of the Institute of Security Studies in Pretoria said the smooth transition in Botswana was expected. 'The fact that we have had an expedited and smooth transfer of power should really surprise no one given Botswana’s pedigree,' Pigou said. 'Of course, there are many lessons for the region where such reflections of such pluralism are largely absent. One hopes there will be lessons learned.' Pigou said Botswana has always been a shining example of democracy in the region, backed by independent public institutions. 'Notwithstanding the fact that Botswana has been ruled by one party for almost six decades until this recent election, it is nevertheless held out as an example of democratic practice, strong independent institutions for the most part in the southern Africa region,' he said. 'There have been concerns of late of compromising those institutions, corruption and so forth under the Masisi administration. But I think by and large what this election has showed is that the institutions have held firm.' Masisi said his hands are clean and is prepared to defend himself if called to answer for any supposed improprieties while in office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-president-says-botswana-s-smooth-transfer-of-power-sets-example-/7850964.html	2024-11-04T10:18:59-08:00	
Pakistan: Border forces kill several militants trying to infiltrate from Afghanistan	Islamabad — Pakistan reported Monday that its border security forces killed at least five insurgents who were attempting to cross over from Afghanistan. The predawn encounter occurred after Pakistani troops detected the 'movement of a group of khwarij' in the volatile South Waziristan border district and 'effectively engaged' them to foil their infiltration attempt, according to a military statement. The term 'khwarij' in official Pakistani documents refers to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed organization waging deadly attacks within the country from its alleged sanctuaries in Afghanistan. Separately, the military said an intelligence-driven operation in the nearby North Waziristan border district killed a key TTP commander. The statement reiterated Islamabad’s call for the Taliban government in Kabul 'to fulfill its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by khwarij' to stage acts of terrorism against Pakistan. It urged Taliban authorities to ensure 'effective' management of the Afghan side of the nearly 2,600-kilometer border between the two countries. Pakistani authorities say the TTP has found sanctuaries in Afghanistan and intensified cross-border attacks since the Islamist Taliban seized power in the neighboring country three years ago, killing hundreds of civilians and security forces. The United Nations has labeled the TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' on Afghan soil. Taliban authorities in Kabul reject the charges, saying they are not allowing any foreign group, including TTP, to use Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-border-forces-kill-several-militants-trying-to-infiltrate-from-afghanistan/7850914.html	2024-11-04T09:35:38-08:00	
India's Modi condemns 'deliberate' Canada Hindu temple attack	New Delhi — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday condemned a 'deliberate attack' on a Hindu temple in Canada blamed by some on Sikh activists, as already frosty bilateral ties plunged to a fresh low. 'I strongly condemn the deliberate attack on a Hindu temple in Canada,' Modi said in a statement on X. 'Equally appalling are the cowardly attempts to intimidate our diplomats.' Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside of India, and includes activists for 'Khalistan', a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory. Relations between India and Canada nosedived after Ottawa accused the Indian government of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Khalistan activist. While India's foreign ministry has repeatedly denied accusations by Canada, and New Delhi has accused Ottawa for decades of harboring fringe religious extremists, these were Modi's first comments on the furious diplomatic row. 'Such acts of violence will never weaken India's resolve. We expect the Canadian government to ensure justice and uphold the rule of law,' Modi added. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier said that the violence at the Hindu temple on Sunday in Brampton, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Toronto, was 'unacceptable'. Video circulating on social media appears to show individuals carrying yellow Khalistan flags clashing with a rival group, including people holding Indian flags. There were also isolated fist fights, videos show. India's foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal had earlier said the attack on the temple was carried 'perpetrated by extremists and separatists', and asked Canada to 'ensure that all places of worship are protected' from such attacks. 'We also expect that those indulging in violence will be prosecuted,' he added. 'We remain deeply concerned about the safety and security of Indian nationals in Canada.' Beyond Nijjar's killing, Canada has accused India of directing a broad campaign targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil, which Ottawa says has included intimidation, threats and violence. Trudeau charged the government of Prime Minister Modi with violating Canadian sovereignty. India has rejected the allegations. On Saturday, New Delhi denied that interior minister Amit Shah had plotted to target Sikh activists on Canadian soil, and said it had officially rebuked Ottawa over the 'absurd and baseless' allegation. New Delhi and Ottawa earlier this month each expelled the other's ambassador and other senior diplomats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-condemns-deliberate-canada-hindu-temple-attack/7850762.html	2024-11-04T08:04:35-08:00

EU, South Korea urge withdrawal of North Korean troops from Russia's war with Ukraine	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea and the European Union on Monday jointly condemned North Korea's supply of weaponry to Moscow and demanded that it withdraw troops it has sent as Russia wages war against Ukraine. The EU and South Korea were holding their first 'Strategic Dialogue' meeting in Seoul, shortly after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending soldiers to help Russia. In a joint statement, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul condemned the North's 'unlawful arms transfers to the Russian Federation for its use in attacking Ukraine.' They demanded an end to the 'unlawful military cooperation' and a withdrawal of the North Korean forces. Borrell also met South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun. 'Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat,' Borrell said in a post on X that included a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. 'The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up.' The two countries also signed a security and defense partnership covering 15 areas including cyber security and disarmament. Cho said last week, when asked whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia, that all possible scenarios were under consideration, South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but rebuffed requests for weapons. Seoul expects the North to be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19. Washington expects the North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, part of which has been seized by neighboring Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukrainian forces soon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country would back Russia until it achieved victory in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-south-korea-urge-withdrawal-of-north-korean-troops-from-russia-s-war-with-ukraine/7850671.html	2024-11-04T06:50:08-08:00	
At least 36 dead in northern India after overcrowded bus skids into deep gorge	Lucknow, India — A poorly maintained and overcrowded bus veered off the road and plunged into a deep gorge in northern India on Monday, killing at least 36 people and injuring several others, officials said. The accident occurred in Almora district in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand. The bus was carrying around 60 people, and more than 20 have been injured, said Deepak Rawat, a senior state government official. Authorities said earlier they believed there were 42 passengers, which was how many people the bus could accommodate. Teams of rescue and relief workers were deployed to the site and officials feared the death toll may rise further, especially as seven passengers in hospital were in critical condition. Television footage showed parts of the bus mangled and destroyed as it lay overturned on a rocky slope, close to a stream. Rescuers were seen working to pull out passengers and carrying bodies on stretchers. The state's chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami earlier said rescue teams were working to quickly evacuate the injured passengers to nearby hospitals and that authorities have been instructed to airlift those seriously hurt. The state government has opened an investigation into the accident, said Vineet Pal, another official in the state. He added that preliminary information suggested that the dilapidated bus skidded before tumbling down a 60 meter-deep gorge. A number of passengers managed to escape or were thrown out by the impact, and then alerted authorities about the accident. Two transport officials have been suspended for approving a bus that was in poor condition, Pal said. India has some of the highest road death rates in the world, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and injured annually. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles. In July, at least 18 people died after a double-decker passenger bus collided with a milk truck in Uttar Pradesh state. In May, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims skidded and rolled into a deep gorge on a mountainous highway in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing at least 21 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/northern-india-uttarakhand-overcrowded-bus-accident/7850623.html	2024-11-04T06:36:53-08:00	
Trial opens in France in beheading of teacher over prophet cartoons	Paris — The trial of eight people in Paris on terrorism charges started on Monday over the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty, who was killed by an Islamic extremist after showing caricatures of Islam's prophet to his middle school students for a lesson on freedom of expression. Paty's shocking death left an imprint on France, and several schools are now named after him. Paty was killed outside his school near Paris on Oct. 16, 2020, by an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, who was shot to death by police. Those on trial include friends of assailant Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped purchase weapons for the attack, as well as people who are accused of spreading false information online about the teacher and his class. The proceedings started Monday in the presence of members of Paty's family, including his two sisters. The trial was held under high security, with many police officers patrolling and making checks outside and inside the courtroom. Five of the accused, who are currently imprisoned, were seated in a wide glass box. Three others, placed under judicial supervision, sat on the defendants' benches outside the box. France's secularism at stake The attack occurred against a backdrop of protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists. The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty's killing reinforced the French state's commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life. 'We expect that the justice system will be up to the crime that has been committed,' Francis Szpiner, the lawyer representing Paty's 9-year-old son, told reporters. 'It's an unheard-of event in the history of the republic. It's the first time a teacher has been assassinated because he is a teacher.' Thibault de Montbrial, a lawyer for Paty's sister, Mickaelle Paty, said the trial 'will enable everybody in French society to become aware of the direct link, extremely clear, that exists between fundamentalist Islam ... and the violence that can lead to such a terrifying act.' A student's father among the accused Much attention at the trial will focus on Brahim Chnina, the Muslim father of a teenager who was 13 at the time and claimed that she had been excluded from Paty's class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020. Chnina, 52, sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that 'this sick man' needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina's daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question. Paty was giving a lesson mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom. An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher's head on social media. Police later shot Anzorov as he advanced towards them armed. Chnina will be tried for alleged association with a terrorist enterprise for targeting the 47-year-old teacher through false information. His daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet. A figure promoting radical Islam involved Abdelhakim Sefrioui, 65, is another key figure in the trial opening Monday for the adult suspects. He presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France, although he had been dismissed from that role. He filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a 'thug' multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media. Sefrioui founded the pro-Hamas Cheikh Yassine Collective in 2004, which was dissolved a few days after Paty's killing. Sefrioui had long criticized and threatened Muslims who advocate friendship with Jews, including the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris. Sefrioui and Chnina face 30 years in prison if convicted. Chnina denied any incitement to 'kill' in his messages and video, claiming he did not intend to incite hatred and violence, according to judicial documents. Sefrioui's lawyer, Ouadie Elhamamouchi, said he will seek to prove his client is 'innocent' and that the video filmed by Sefrioui in front of the school was not seen by the attacker. 'In this case, he is the only one who never had any link with the terrorist,' Elhamamouchi said. Others face charges of complicity Anzorov, who had wanted to go to Syria to fight with Islamic extremists there, discovered Paty's name on jihadist social media channels, according to investigators. Anzorov lived 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Paty's school and did not know the teacher. Two of Anzorov's friends face life imprisonment if convicted on charges of complicity in murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise. Naim Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, are accused of helping Anzorov buy a knife and a pellet gun. Boudaoud also drove Anzorov to Paty's school. They turned themselves in at the police station, and deny being aware of the attacker's intentions. The other four individuals are charged with criminal terrorist conspiracy for communicating with the killer on pro-jihad Snapchat groups. They all deny being aware of the intent to kill Paty. On Oct. 13, 2023, another teacher in France was killed by a radical Islamist from Russia, originally from Ingushetia, a region bordering Chechnya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-opens-in-france-in-beheading-of-teacher-over-prophet-cartoons/7850565.html	2024-11-04T05:59:39-08:00	
Spain deploys 7,500 troops to flood zone where anger rises at slow help	PAIPORTA, Spain — Spain is deploying 7,500 troops to its eastern region hit by devastating floods, the government said on Monday in the face of rising discontent over the response to the catastrophe that has killed at least 217 people. The army sent about 5,000 soldiers over the weekend to help distribute food and water, clean up streets and protect shops and properties from looters. A further 2,500 would join them, Defense Minister Margarita Robles told state-owned radio RNE. A warship carrying 104 marine infantry soldiers as well as trucks with food and water was approaching Valencia port even as a strong hailstorm pummeled Barcelona some 300 km to the north. Rescue teams on Monday were searching for bodies in underground garages including a 5,000-car park at Bonaire shopping mall near Valencia airport as well as river mouths where currents may have deposited bodies. Fatalities from Spain's worst flash floods in modern history edged higher to 217 on Sunday - almost all of them in the Valencia region and more than 60 in the suburb of Paiporta. Local residents' anger was focused on late alerts from authorities about the dangers of flooding and a perceived delayed response by emergency services. On Sunday, some residents in Paiporta slung mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe and his wife Queen Letizia, chanting: 'murderers, murderers!' Transport Minister Oscar Puente said on Sunday the death toll had stabilized because all victims on the surface had been identified. The torrential rains on Tuesday and Wednesday caused rivers to swell, engulfing streets and the ground floors of buildings, and sweeping away cars and pieces of masonry in tides of mud. It was the worst flood-related disaster in Europe in five decades Even though rainfalls have continued during the rest of the week, there has been no more major flooding in the area. The weather agency issued a warning on Monday morning for Barcelona as hailstorm and heavy rains hit Spain's second largest city. Some of Sunday's protesters wore clothing with the symbols of far-right organizations that often stage protests against the leftist government. Robles said extremist groups were taking advantage of the situation for political gains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-deploys-7-500-troops-to-flood-zone-where-anger-rises-at-slow-help/7850383.html	2024-11-04T02:37:52-08:00	
French prosecutors drop harassment probe into ex-soccer chief Le Graet	Paris — French prosecutors on Monday said they had dropped an investigation into sexual and moral harassment allegations against former French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet. The preliminary inquiry, opened in January 2023, was closed on Oct. 17 due to insufficient evidence, the Paris public prosecution office said in e-mailed comments. Le Graet, 82, who had led the federation since 2011, resigned in February but denied any wrongdoing. His departure followed a government audit that concluded he no longer had 'the necessary legitimacy' to lead French soccer. French papers L'Equipe and Le Monde first reported that the investigation into Le Graet had been dropped. 'I lived through a nightmare, but being cleared in this affair brings some comfort,' Le Graet told L'Equipe in an interview published on Monday, adding that he felt anger but also relief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prosecutors-drop-harassment-probe-into-ex-soccer-chief-le-graet-/7850372.html	2024-11-04T02:22:41-08:00	
Malaysia complains to Vietnam over South China Sea reef expansion, sources say	Malaysia has sent a complaint letter to Vietnam over its alleged expansion of a South China Sea reef that both countries claim as their own, two officials told Reuters, in a rare bilateral escalation not involving China. The move brings to light another of the multiple disputes in the strategic waterway, most of which China claims sovereignty over, with Beijing involved in frequent altercations with the Philippines and sporadic rows with Vietnam. The most contested features are around the Spratly archipelago, where China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines all have various claims and degrees of occupation. Malaysia's letter was sent to Vietnam's foreign ministry in early October but has so far received no reply, the two officials said, declining to be identified more precisely because the matter was sensitive. The complaint was over Vietnam's alleged artificial expansion of the Barque Canada Reef, an islet in the Spratlys where Vietnam has built numerous infrastructure, according to satellite images analyzed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, which were released last month. In late October, Radio Free Asia reported that Vietnam was also building an airstrip on the reef. Vietnam's foreign ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Malaysia's foreign ministry did not comment. The letter preceded those publications and only criticized the enlargement of the islet, not the building of infrastructure, one of the officials said. The tiny Spratly islands have seen significant construction in recent years as countries seek to bolster their territorial claims and prove they can sustain human habitation on dozens of islets and features. China's activities have attracted the most attention, with seven islands built on submerged reefs, some equipped with runways, docks, control towers and missile batteries. Though complaints between Malaysia and Vietnam over territory are rare, Malaysia has taken issue regularly over what it says is encroachment by Vietnamese fishermen into its Exclusive Economic Zone, leading to the arrest of some crew.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-complains-to-vietnam-over-south-china-sea-reef-expansion-sources-say/7850369.html	2024-11-04T02:14:22-08:00	
India's factory growth accelerates in October, purchasing managers’ data shows	BENGALURU, India — India's manufacturing growth gained momentum in October after decelerating for three months as demand improved significantly, helping in job creation and leading to a better business outlook, according to a business survey released on Monday. The HSBC final India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 57.5 in October from an eight-month low of 56.5 in September and was above a preliminary estimate of 57.4. 'India's headline manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers’ index) picked up substantially in October as the economy's operating conditions continue to broadly improve,' noted Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. 'Rapidly expanding new orders and international sales reflect strong demand growth for India's manufacturing sector.' The output and new orders sub-indexes rose to three-month highs with a notable increase in demand. International demand improved from a year-and-a-half low in September. A desire for Indian goods led to orders from Asia, Europe, Latin America and the U.S. Buoyant demand also boosted the outlook for the year ahead. 'Business confidence is also very high due to expectations of continued strong consumer demand, new product releases, and sales pending approval,' Bhandari said. To meet growing demand, firms took on many more workers than in September. Hiring increased for an eighth consecutive month. That would probably bring some relief to the government, which has failed to create enough well-paying jobs for those entering the workforce. Economists cautioned job creation will remain muted over the next 12 months, a Reuters poll published a week ago showed. Inflationary pressures increased with both input and output prices rising faster. Input cost inflation was the highest in three months, elevated by higher material costs, wage bills and transportation fees. Firms passed on the extra costs to their clients at a much quicker pace than in September. India's inflation rose to a nine-month high of 5.49% in September, largely driven by higher food prices and close to the upper end of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 2-6% target. Despite that, a separate Reuters poll last week showed a slim majority of economists expected the RBI to cut interest rates in December, to 6.25% from 6.50% currently.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-factory-growth-accelerates-in-october-purchasing-managers-data-shows/7850363.html	2024-11-04T02:03:29-08:00	
German foreign minister pledges Ukraine support in Kyiv visit	German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged her country’s support for Ukraine during a visit Monday to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian leaders. Baerbock said Ukraine needs support amid Russian airstrikes as its heads into another winter season, and with the added threat of North Korean military support for Russia. 'We are countering this brutality with our humanity and support, so that Ukrainians can not only survive the winter, but so that their country can survive. Because they are also defending the freedom of all of us in Europe,' Baerbock said. Ukraine’s military said Monday the country’s air defenses shot down 50 of the 80 drones that Russian forces used in overnight attacks targeting areas across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Kharkiv reported Monday that Russian aerial attacks injured at least 13 people. In Kyiv, officials said falling debris from downed drones sparked several fires in the Ukrainian capital. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down one Ukrainian drone over the Belgorod region that sits along the Russia-Ukraine border.

Public funding for nature conservation stalls at COP16, eyes on private investment	CALI, Colombia — Wealthy nations appeared to hit a limit with how much they are willing to pay to conserve nature around the world, instead shifting their focus at the two-week U.N. biodiversity summit toward discussions of private money filling the funding gap. At the COP16 negotiations in Cali, Colombia, countries failed to figure out how they would mobilize $200 billion annually in conservation funding by 2030, including $30 billion that would come directly from rich nations. That money, pledged two years ago as part of the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework agreement, is meant to finance activities that boost nature, such as sustainable farming or patrolling wildlife reserves. But there was no consensus as talks dragged on beyond the summit's scheduled end on Friday, during which dozens of delegations departed. By Saturday morning's roll call, there was no longer a quorum among the nearly 200 nations for an agreement to pass, forcing organizers to abruptly suspend the meeting. 'I am both saddened and enraged by the non-outcome of COP16,' said Shilps Gautam, chief executive of project finance firm Opna. 'The wild thing about the nature financing discussions is that the numbers discussed are already a pittance.' Human activities such as farming, mining, and urban development are increasingly pushing nature into crisis, with 1 million or so plant and animal species thought to be at risk of extinction. Climate change, a result of fossil fuel burning, is also adding to nature's woes by raising temperatures and disrupting weather cycles. Countries will meet again in Azerbaijan next week for the U.N.'s COP29 climate summit, which again will be focused on the steep need for funding from wealthy nations to their poorer counterparts to help shoulder climate costs. Little money from rich nations Even before the talks broke down, developed nations had signaled an unwillingness to offer large amounts of cash. European governments including Germany and the Netherlands have slashed their foreign aid budgets over the last year, while France and the U.K. are also cutting back. Government development money specifically targeted at nature conservation abroad fell to $3.8 billion in 2022 compared with $4.6 billion in 2015, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. At COP16, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres demanded that countries make significant new contributions to the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund. The response was muted. Nations at COP16 pledged $163 million in contributions to the fund, bringing total contributions to roughly $400 million - far from a major contribution to the $30 billion target from nations by 2030. The United States, which is not a party to U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, has not contributed. 'The public money is already leveraged as much as we can,' Florika Fink-Hooijer, the European Union's director general of environment, told reporters at the summit. 'We now have to look at other sources of funding.' Private cash When it came to going after private capital, delegates at the COP16 summit agreed to a plan to charge pharmaceutical and other companies for their use of genetic information in the research and development of new commercial products. Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca and Land Sanofi did not respond to request for comment on the deal. Experts estimate the plan could generate about $1 billion annually. That still doesn't cover the billions needed to halt the collapse of ecosystems, like the Amazon rainforest or coral reefs. The world will need to devise ways for enticing private investment in nature-friendly projects, said Marcos Neto, director of global policy at the U.N. Development Program. Some tools include green bonds or debt-for-nature swaps, whereby countries refinance their debt at lower interest rates in order to spend the savings on conservation. The World Economic Forum estimates that debt-for-nature swaps could generate $100 billion in nature funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/public-funding-for-nature-conservation-stalls-at-cop16-eyes-on-private-investment/7850354.html	2024-11-04T01:37:37-08:00	
Turkey replaces pro-Kurdish mayors with state officials in southeast	ISTANBUL, Turkey — Turkey stripped three elected pro-Kurdish mayors of their posts in southeastern cities on Monday, for convictions and charges on terrorism-related offenses, the interior ministry said, appointing state officials in their places instead. Local governors replaced the mayors in the provincial centers of Mardin and Batman, while the mayor of Halfeti in Sanliurfa province was also unseated, it said. All belonged to the pro-Kurdish DEM Party, which has 57 seats in the national parliament. Dozens of pro-Kurdish mayors from its predecessor parties have been removed from their posts on similar charges in the past. Last week, a mayor from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) was arrested after prosecutors accused him of belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), banned as a terrorist group in Turkey. The changes followed a proposal by President Tayyip's Erdogan main ally last month aimed at ending the state's 40-year conflict with the PKK.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-replaces-pro-kurdish-mayors-with-state-officials-in-southeast/7850347.html	2024-11-04T01:27:15-08:00	
Central bank independence challenged in many countries, Thai bank governor says	BANGKOK — The independence of central banks is being challenged and they have come under more pressure lately than at any time in the past decade, the Bank of Thailand chief said, according to a speech transcript released on Monday. 'Central bank independence in many countries, including Thailand, is being challenged despite having done a reasonable job over past decades,' Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput said in remarks made at the Bank of International Settlements annual conference in Switzerland, an undated transcript of which the Bank of Thailand released on Monday. 'If we allow central bank independence to be eroded, we will not be able to deliver on our core mandates,' the governor said. The conference took place on June 28, according to the Bank of International Settlements website, which on Oct. 30 published a paper with transcripts of remarks made at the event by several central bank governors, including Sethaput. The Bank of Thailand later on Monday removed the transcript from its site. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments were delivered at a time when the Bank of Thailand had clashed with Thailand's government over monetary policy, with the central bank until last month coming under near-daily pressure to cut interest rates to help spur growth. The Bank of Thailand unexpectedly cut its benchmark rate to 2.25% in October, but has since stressed that it was not embarking on an easing cycle and said the move was a 'recalibration' and not a caving to political pressure. Former Bank of Thailand governors last week expressed their concern that a candidate for the role of central bank board chairman had 'close political ties,' widely seen as referring to the government's nominee, a critic of the current governor. The Thai government has maintained it respects the Bank of Thailand's independence, but wants it to do more to help it revive the economy, growth of which has been tepid. The Bank of Thailand on Monday said the decision on a candidate had been delayed until next week, the second time it has been postponed. The finance minister said the role had limited authority and the delay would not impact the central bank's work. In the remarks at the conference in Switzerland in June, Sethaput also said unconventional policies such as expanding balance sheets and pervasive crisis measures had expanded central banks' footprints in private markets and raised expectations on what a central bank can achieve. 'It results in not just moving the goalpost but also adding more goalposts. As expectations increase, it becomes harder to ring-fence our reputation, credibility and the case for central bank independence,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-bank-independence-challenged-in-many-countries-thai-bank-governor-says/7850337.html	2024-11-04T00:50:41-08:00	
French families sue TikTok over alleged failure to remove harmful content	PARIS — Seven French families have filed a lawsuit against social media giant TikTok, accusing the platform of exposing their adolescent children to harmful content that led to two of them taking their own lives at 15, their lawyer said on Monday. The lawsuit alleges TikTok's algorithm exposed the seven teenagers to videos promoting suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion told broadcaster franceinfo. The families are taking joint legal action in the Créteil judicial court. Boutron-Marmion said it was the first such grouped case in Europe. 'The parents want TikTok's legal liability to be recognized in court,' she said, adding: 'This is a commercial company offering a product to consumers who are, in addition, minors. They must, therefore, answer for the product's shortcomings.' TikTok, like other social media platforms, has long faced scrutiny over the policing of content on its app. As with Meta's Facebook and Instagram, it faces hundreds of lawsuits in the U.S. accusing them of enticing and addicting millions of children to their platforms, damaging their mental health. TikTok could not immediately be reached for comment on the allegations. The company has previously said it took issues that were linked to children's mental health seriously. CEO Shou Zi Chew this year told U.S. lawmakers the company has invested in measures to protect young people who use the app.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-families-sue-tiktok-over-alleged-failure-to-remove-harmful-content/7850334.html	2024-11-04T00:32:28-08:00	
Music titan Quincy Jones dies at 91	Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic 'Thriller' album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91. Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. 'Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,' the family said in a statement. 'And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.' Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him. Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for 'Roots' and 'In the Heat of the Night,' organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of 'We Are the World,' the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa. Lionel Richie, who co-wrote 'We Are the World' and was among the featured singers, would call Jones 'the master orchestrator.' In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: 'Off the Wall,' 'Thriller' and 'Bad' were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the 'King of Pop.' On such classic tracks as 'Billie Jean' and 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,' Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For 'Thriller,' some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing 'Beat It' and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track. 'Thriller' sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' 'Greatest Hits 1971-1975' among others as the best-selling album of all time. 'If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,' Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. 'The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.' The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography 'Q', including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for 'Roots.' He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, 'Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones' and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones.

Two of Iran's Revolutionary Guards die in gyroplane crash	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Two of Iran's Revolutionary Guards died in a gyroplane crash in the southeastern region on Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency cited the force's public relations department as saying. The accident happened near Sirkan, a city in the province of Sistan-Baluchustan bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has long been the site of frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and Sunni militants as well as drug traffickers. 'Second Brigadier General Hamid Mazandarani, the commander of the Nineva Brigade of Golestan province, and his pilot, were martyred in this accident,' the agency said. However, it did not say why the commander of the brigade, based in the northern province, was visiting the southeast at the time. Ten Iranian border guards were killed in the province last month, in clashes with suspected Sunni Muslim militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-of-iran-s-revolutionary-guards-die-in-gyroplane-crash/7850324.html	2024-11-03T23:50:01-08:00	
EU'S Borrell visits South Korea amid alarm over North Korean troops in Russia	SEOUL, South Korea — The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell holds talks on Monday with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul, amid growing concerns in Seoul over the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia for its war with Ukraine. Borrell arrived in South Korea after a trip to Japan and visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas, the diplomat said in a post on social media platform X on Sunday. 'My visit today of the Demilitarized Zone - DMZ - between the Republic of Korea and the DPRK is yet another reminder of the need to invest more in peace,' Borrell said in the post, referring to the initials of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Borrell is visiting South Korea to take security and defense cooperation between the the EU and Seoul to 'the next level,' he said in another post, without elaborating. The first such Strategic Dialogue meeting between the EU and South Korea comes as Washington and Seoul have been sounding the alarm about the dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia for its war with Ukraine. Borrell met with South Korea's defense minister Kim Yong-hyun in Seoul on Monday and expressed concern over the development, the Yonhap news agency reported. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea's aiding Russia. South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but so far has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons. Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19. Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region to enter the fight against Ukraine in the coming days, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieved victory in the Ukraine war at talks in Moscow on Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-s-borrell-visits-south-korea-amid-alarm-over-north-korean-troops-in-russia-/7850314.html	2024-11-03T23:22:13-08:00	
Myanmar junta chief to make first China visit since seizing power	Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing will travel to China this week to attend regional summits, state media said on Monday, in the embattled top general's first visit to the influential neighboring nation since he seized power in a 2021 coup. Since the coup, Myanmar has been in chaos, including areas along its border with China, as an armed resistance movement combined with established ethnic minority militias to wrest control of large territories from the military government. Min Aung Hlaing will attend summits of the Greater Mekong Subregion and the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Co-operation Strategy and join a meeting with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam on Nov. 6 and 7 in Kunming, MRTV said. 'He will have meetings and discussions with authorities from China and will work on enhancing the bilateral relationship, economic and development in several sectors,' it said, referring to the junta chief. The Myanmar military's deterioration, in the face of rapid gains by anti-junta fighters since a surprise offensive last October, has alarmed China, which has sealed parts of the border and halted key imports to rebel-controlled areas, Reuters has reported. China has strategic economic interests in Myanmar, including major oil and gas pipelines crossing the country and a planned deep-sea port in the Bay of Bengal. Beijing also imports rare earths from its smaller neighbor for use in the automotive and wind energy sectors. 'Whether he is going there to receive more Chinese support or more Chinese pressure, it's only bad for the people,' said David Mathieson, an independent analyst who tracks Myanmar. 'China has made clear they are supporting the SAC and their elections transition plan,' he said, referring to the junta's State Administration Council, headed by Min Aung Hlaing. The junta began a nationwide census last month to pave the way for an election next year, despite not having control over wide swathes of the country, and with dozens of political parties disbanded. Beijing promised technical support and aid to the junta for the census and the proposed election, Myanmar state media said in August after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Min Aung Hlaing. The meeting, in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw, was seen by some critics as Beijing's endorsement of the junta and activists in the war-torn country have voiced frustration at China's stance, calling it a barrier to their struggle for democracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-chief-to-make-first-china-visit-since-seizing-power/7850312.html	2024-11-03T23:15:15-08:00	
Boeing machinists are holding a contract vote that could end their 7-week strike	Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes. A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing's offer, it would plunge the company into further financial peril and uncertainty. In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago. 'It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,' the union district said in scheduling Monday's vote. 'We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as we have achieved so much success.' Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote Monday night. Boeing has adamantly rejected requests to restore traditional pensions that the company froze nearly a decade ago. Pensions were a key issue for workers who voted down previous offers in September and October. If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union. The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years. Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, but still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal. Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer. In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement accounts. Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer. The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week. The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company. Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company. The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane's crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max. As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade. The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling plane, and the 777 or 'triple-seven' jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane. Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and 'serious lapses in our performance' have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-machinists-are-holding-a-contract-vote-that-could-end-their-7-week-strike-/7850309.html	2024-11-03T23:02:34-08:00	
Bolivia's Evo Morales says he'll press on with a hunger strike	LAUCA N, Bolivia — Bolivia's transformative and divisive former President Evo Morales said Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue. His act of dissent aims to defuse street protests that have paralyzed the nation in recent weeks over what Morales' supporters condemn as his political persecution. Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his fraught ouster, spoke on his third day without food from the misty tropics of Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold. 'My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,' Morales told The Associated Press from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led. The ex-president said he began his hunger strike Friday in hopes of 'international organizations or friendly governments' facilitating talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce. Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he’s now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections. Protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an Indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only Indigenous-majority nation. Morales has denied any wrongdoing. 'My crime is being Indigenous,' he said on Sunday. The AP reached Morales after an arduous 11-hour journey by car, motorcycle and foot over hills and through the highlands, circumventing road blockades, crisscrossing routes littered with debris and toppled trees and squeaking through over a dozen security checkpoints, in some cases manned by profiteers. Roadblocks are a common protest tactic in Bolivia, where the mountainous terrain means a few strategically positioned checkpoints can can isolate major cities and bring the whole nation to a halt. That's exactly what happened earlier this month, marooning hundreds of thousands of residents in the highlands, raising fears of food and gasoline shortages and hiking up the prices of basic goods in major cities, including La Paz, the capital. 'I see people rising up even more,' said Eusebio Urbano, a farmer protesting in support of Morales at one of the road blockades Sunday. 'I don’t know what this government thinks. ... They don’t try to solve anything. We have to keep pushing until it leaves.' Under public pressure to quell the unrest, Arce's government sent some 3,000 police officers armed with tear gas and backed by helicopters to break up the blockades by force. Eduardo Del Castillo, a senior Cabinet minister, said security forces had arrested dozens of protesters in clearing the main road linking Cochabamba, Bolivia’s third-biggest city, with La Paz. Authorities transferred over 50 of the demonstrators to pre-trial detention in the capital on charges related to violating public order, he said. 'What happened was very inhumane,' Morales said of the crackdown, adding that his refusal to eat was also aimed at pressuring authorities to release the 66 detainees. 'These are humble people who were presented as terrorists.' It was the latest turn in Bolivia’s long-running political crisis, which escalated last week when gunmen ambushed Morales’ convoy in what the former president claimed was a government-led assassination attempt. Officials in Arce’s government denied this, alleging that police opened fire because Morales’ van had barreled through a security checkpoint. 'They’ve been using any tactic they can, politically, legally, morally and now, physically, to end my life,' Morales said. From there, protests in defense of Morales only intensified. On Friday, Arce’s government accused his demonstrators of occupying military barracks in Chapare, a flashpoint for conflict since the U.S.-backed war on drugs in the 1990s. Authorities said that Morales' more radical loyalists seized weapons and held some 200 soldiers hostage Friday. Morales and his supporters rejected reports of a violent hostage situation, with the leader's Kausachun Coca radio station airing footage that showed protesting union members and soldiers negotiating calmly while munching on coca leaves. 'Please, it’s no a take-over of military barracks,' Morales said. 'They are holding vigils until their economic and political demands are met.' Del Castillo, the minister, said Sunday that the government is, in principle, open to negotiating a resolution to the political crisis with Morales. But he said authorities didn’t trust Morales' motives. 'Morales doesn’t care about the country, he cares about himself,' Del Castillo said. 'He's looking for new confrontations.' The crisis stems from a bitter rift at the highest rungs of Bolivia’s long-dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, which deepened last month when authorities announced their intention to arrest Morales on charges that he fathered a daughter with a 15-year-old girl in 2016 when he was 56 years old and president. Morales and his supporters have decried the case as a political witch hunt aimed at blocking his candidacy in the 2025 election. Arce insists that the current constitution — which permits just two consecutive terms — forbids Morales, who held power from 2006-2019, from running next year, anyway. It was Morales' quest for a fourth term that led to his ouster, which he and his supporters view as a coup. 'It is a betrayal of the people, of the party activists, of the revolution,' Morales said of Arce's efforts to undercut him. In neighboring Argentina, the government of far-right President Javier Milei on Saturday announced it had lodged a complaint accusing Morales of child abuse committed during the former president’s monthslong political exile in Argentina, from 2019 to 2020. At that time, Morales' contested re-election sparked mass protests that prompted him to resign under pressure from the military and flee to Mexico before seeking asylum in Argentina. Now, years later, the charismatic populist — who continues to evince intense support from the Indigenous population — has seized upon growing public discontent with his chosen successor. 'It’s not that I, Evo, want to be president. The people have asked me to return,' Morales said. 'During my administration there was stability. When there is economic and political stability, there is happiness.' Many in the country have soured on Arce over the collapse of Bolivia’s once-prosperous economy built on cheap dollars and fuel. They look back fondly on the tenure of Morales, credited with lifting millions out of poverty and drastically narrowing Bolivia's wealth divide during the nation's natural gas boom. 'Now with more experience, we are ready to save Bolivia,' Morales said. Aware that the economic model that led to Bolivia's remarkable growth had quite literally run out of gas, Morales said he would reverse the nation's economic downturn by having Bolivia join BRICS, a group of emerging economies seeking to counter Western dominance of the world order, and collaborating more closely with China. The former president, now 65, isn't sure how long his hunger strike will last. But he said he's prepared for the deprivation. 'I do a lot of sports,' Morales said. 'Today I woke up at 4 a.m. and did 1,015 sit-ups.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-evo-morales-says-he-ll-press-on-with-a-hunger-strike-/7850308.html	2024-11-03T23:00:30-08:00	
Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UNRWA after new legislation	Israel’s foreign ministry said Monday the country formally notified the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, once new Israeli legislation goes into effect early next year. The move follows the Israeli parliament’s approval of legislation severing ties with the agency and banning it from operating in Israel. 'Despite the overwhelming evidence we submitted to the UN that substantiate Hamas' infiltration of UNRWA, the UN did nothing to rectify the situation,' Israel’s Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon said in a statement. Israel has long been critical of UNRWA and has accused some of its staff of taking part in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel has provided little evidence to support its claims, and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said last week that the agency has received no response to its repeated requests for Israel to provide such information. 'UNRWA is therefore in the invidious position of being unable to address allegations for which it has no evidence, while these allegations continue to be used to undermine the Agency,' Lazzarini said. UNRWA has been the main distributor of aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip where Israel’s response to the Hamas attack has devastated many areas and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. Lazzarini said last week that dismantling the agency 'will have a catastrophic impact on the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.' Israel’s letter to the U.N. says the country 'will continue to work with international partners, including other United Nations agencies, to ensure the facilitation of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not undermine Israel's security.' Humanitarian agencies have repeatedly complained of delays in getting aid into Gaza, as well as unsafe conditions to distribute aid within Gaza to due to the fighting. Syria raid Israel said Sunday it launched a ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syrian it claimed was involved in Iranian networks supporting militants in the region. The Israeli raid into Syria was its first during the current 13-month Mideast conflict. Syria did not immediately confirm the operation. The Israeli army did not say where the raid occurred or when, but identified the man seized as Ali Soleiman al-Assi and said he had been living in the southern Syrian region of Saida. Israel said he had been under military surveillance for many months and was involved in Iranian initiatives targeting areas of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria. Body camera footage of the raid released by the army showed soldiers seizing a man in a white tank top inside a building. The man was brought to Israel for interrogation, the military said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border with Lebanon on Sunday, saying that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon must be pushed back beyond the Litani River, with or without a cease-fire deal in place, and that the Iran-backed group must be prevented from rearming. The river is about 30 kilometers north of the Israeli border. 'With or without an agreement, the key to returning our (evacuated) residents in the north safely to their homes is to keep back Hezbollah beyond the Litani, to strike its every attempt [to] rearm, and to respond forcefully against all action against us,' Netanyahu said. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,300 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-notifies-un-it-will-not-cooperate-with-unrwa-after-new-legislation/7850306.html	2024-11-03T22:47:46-08:00	
Oklahoma storms injure at least 11 and leave thousands without power	OKLAHOMA CITY — Severe storms and tornadoes battered Oklahoma early Sunday, tossing cars and ripping roofs off buildings in the middle of the night and leaving tens of thousands of homes and businesses without power. Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization, authorities said. Much of the damage was reported in and around the state capital of Oklahoma City, near the state's center, but also scattered elsewhere around the state. The early morning storms set off tornado warnings that extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was reported. More than 99,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses lost power during the overnight storms. By late Sunday afternoon, that number was reduced to around 24,000. No fatalities had been reported. Richard Thompson, forecast chief for the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said he believes six or more tornadoes hit the state overnight. Meanwhile, forecasters warned state residents to brace for more heavy rain and possible severe weather through Monday. 'We're not done with it yet,' he said. A tornado watch for much of the central and southeast part of Oklahoma was in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday. Other areas were under thunderstorm or flood watches. In the town of Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, firefighters and police officers went door to door Sunday morning to ask about injuries. 'It leveled a complete neighborhood in Choctaw,' the town’s mayor, Chad Allcox, told The Associated Press. He added that debris hindered search and rescue efforts. 'Power lines are down everywhere ... a lot of the roads are blocked, hard to get through. Very large trees blocking roadways.' Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman Scott Douglas told the AP that heavy rain and the lingering threat of tornadoes in the early morning darkness complicated early search and rescue efforts. He described a first sweep of hard-hit areas around 1:30 a.m. Emergency workers had to free two people from an overturned mobile home, including a woman injured when an air conditioner landed on her leg, Douglas said. The scale of the damage came into focus as daylight broke. Local television footage showed downed power lines, walls peeled off homes, overturned vehicles and neighborhood streets littered with debris. Douglas said 11 people were transported to hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening. 'There were some other minor injuries, some walking wounded, that were going to get treatment on their own,' Douglas said. Allcox said early weather warnings and tornado sirens likely saved lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oklahoma-storms-injure-at-least-11-and-leave-thousands-without-power-/7850299.html	2024-11-03T22:16:31-08:00	
Pakistan shuts primary schools for a week in Lahore due to dangerous air quality	LAHORE, Pakistan — Dangerously poor air quality on Monday forced Pakistani authorities in the cultural capital of Lahore to close primary schools for a week, government officials said, after the air-quality index hit a record high over the weekend. The measures in Lahore were part of a larger effort to protect children from respiratory-related and other diseases in the city of 14 million people. The government said everyone in Lahore was required to wear a face mask. Fifty percent of employees must also work from home as part of a 'green lockdown' in the city, the government said, adding that barbecuing food without filters was banned and motorized rickshaws restricted. Wedding halls must close at 10 p.m. and artificial rain is likely to be used to combat the pollution. The air-quality index in Lahore exceeded 1,000 over the weekend, a record high in Pakistan. Toxic gray smog has sickened tens of thousands of people, mainly children and elderly people, since last month when the air quality started worsening in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province bordering India. The government has also banned construction work in certain areas and fined owners of smoke-emitting vehicles. Schools will remain closed for a week because of the pollution, according to a government notification. The concentration of PM 2.5, or tiny particulate matter, in the air approached 450, considered hazardous, the Punjab Environment Protection Department said. Lahore was once known as a city of gardens, which were ubiquitous during the Mughal era from the 16th to 19th centuries. But rapid urbanization and surging population growth have left little room for greenery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-shuts-primary-schools-for-a-week-in-lahore-due-to-dangerous-air-quality-/7850298.html	2024-11-03T22:09:47-08:00	
US tech firms warn Vietnam's planned law to hamper data centers, social media	HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. tech companies have warned Vietnam's government that a draft law to tighten rules on data protection and limit data transfers abroad would hamper social media platforms and data center operators from growing their businesses in the country. The Southeast Asian nation with a population of 100 million is one of the world's largest markets for Facebook and other online platforms, and is aiming to exponentially increase its data center industry with foreign investment in coming years. The draft law 'will make it challenging for tech companies, social media platforms and data center operators to reach the customers that rely on them daily,' said Jason Oxman, who chairs the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing big tech companies including Meta, Google and data centers operator Equinix. The draft law, being discussed in parliament, is also designed to ease authorities' access to information and was urged by the ministry of public security, Vietnamese and foreign officials said. The ministry of public security and the information ministry did not respond to attempts to contact them via email and phone. Vietnam's parliament is discussing the law in its current month-long session and is scheduled to pass it on Nov. 30 'if eligible,' according to its program, which is subject to changes. Existing Vietnamese regulations already limit cross-border transfers of data under some circumstances, but they are rarely enforced. It is unclear how the new law, if adopted, would impact foreign investment in the country. Reuters reported in August that Google was considering setting up a large data center in southern Vietnam before the draft law was presented in parliament. Research firm BMI had said Vietnam could become a major regional player in the data center industry as limits on foreign ownership are set to end next year. Among the provisions of the draft law is prior authorization for the transfer overseas of 'core data' and 'important data,' which are currently vaguely defined. 'That will hinder foreign business operations,' Oxman told Reuters. Tech companies and other firms favor cross-border data flows to cut costs and improve services, but multiple jurisdictions, including the European Union and China, have limited those transfers, saying that allows them to better protect privacy and sensitive information. Under the draft law, companies will have to share data with Vietnam's ruling Communist Party and state organizations in multiple, vaguely defined cases including for 'fulfilling a specific task in the public interest.' The U.S. tech industry has raised concerns with Vietnamese authorities over 'the undue expansion of government access to data,' Oxman said. The new law 'would cause significant compliance challenges for most private sector companies,' said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, noting talks were underway to persuade authorities to 'reconsider the rushed legislative process' for the law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tech-firms-warn-vietnam-s-planned-law-to-hamper-data-centers-social-media/7850290.html	2024-11-03T21:36:26-08:00	
Indonesia's Laki-laki volcano on Flores Island erupts, killing 9 people	JAKARTA, Indonesia — At least nine people died after Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki in eastern Indonesia erupted on Sunday, spewing explosive plumes of lava and forcing authorities to evacuate several nearby villages, officials said on Monday. Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki, located on Flores Island in East Nusa Tenggara province, erupted on Sunday night, belching a fiery-red column of lava, volcanic ash and incandescent rocks, Hadi Wijaya, a spokesperson for The Center of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation , said on Monday. 'After the eruption, there was power outage and then it was raining and big lightning which caused panic among residents,' he told Reuters, adding that the authority had raised the status of the volcano to level IV or the highest. The agency has recommended a seven-kilometer radius must be cleared. Fiery lava and rocks hit the nearest settlements around 4 kilometers from the crater, burning and damaging residents' houses, Hadi said. As of Monday morning at least nine people had died, said Heronimus Lamawuran, a local official at East Flores area, adding the eruption had affected seven villages. 'We have started evacuating residents since this morning to other villages located around 20 kilometers from the crater,' he said. The nearest villages were covered by thick volcanic ash on Monday morning, Heronimus added. The authorities are still gathering data on the number of evacuees and damaged buildings. Indonesia sits on the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates. This eruption follows a series of eruptions of different volcanoes in Indonesia. In May, a volcano on the remote island of Halmahera, Mount Ibu, caused evacuation of people from seven villages. North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano also erupted in May and prompted authorities to evacuate more than 12,000 people. Flash floods and cold lava flow from Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province, covered several nearby districts following torrential rain on May 11, killing more than 60 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-laki-laki-volcano-on-flores-island-erupts-killing-9-people/7850275.html	2024-11-03T20:17:19-08:00	
Puerto Rico prepares for Election Day as a third-party candidate makes history	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The two parties that have dominated Puerto Rican politics for decades are losing their grip as they face the stiffest competition yet from a younger generation fed up with the island's corruption, chronic power outages and mismanagement of public funds. For the first time in the island's governor's race, a third-party candidate has a powerful second lead in the polls ahead of the U.S. territory's election Tuesday — and some experts say there's a possibility he could win. 'This election is already historic,' said political analyst and university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto. 'It already marks a before and an after.' Juan Dalmau is running for Puerto Rico's Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement, established in 2019. A Gaither international poll this month shows Dalmau closing in on Jenniffer González, a member of the New Progressive Party and Puerto Rico's representative in Congress. She beat Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in their party's primary in June. Gaither's poll shows Dalmau with 29% of support versus González's 31% as he nearly caught up with her since a different poll in July showed him with only 24% compared with González's 43%. Coming in third was Jesús Manuel Ortiz, of the Popular Democratic Party, followed by Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019. Under pressure Puerto Rican politics revolve around the island's status, and up until 2016, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood, and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, would split at least 90% of all votes during general elections, Schmidt said. But that year, U.S. Congress created a federal control board to oversee Puerto Rico's finances after the government announced it was unable to pay a more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, Puerto Rico filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history. The debt was accrued through decades of corruption, mismanagement and excessive borrowing, with Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority still struggling to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, the largest of any government agency. Puerto Ricans have largely rejected and resented the board, created a year before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid. In 2020, Pierluisi won but received only 33% of votes. His opponent from the Popular Democratic Party received 32%. It marked the first time either party failed to reach 40% of votes. The power outages that have persisted since the elections, coupled with the slow pace of hurricane reconstruction, have frustrated and angered voters. Under Pierluisi, the government signed contracts with two companies, Luma Energy and Genera PR, which together oversee the generation, transmission and distribution of power. Outages have persisted, with the companies blaming a grid that was already crumbling before the hurricane hit due to a lack of maintenance and investment. 'Disastrous things have occurred during this four-year term, especially with the electric energy,' Schmidt said. 'It has affected everyone, regardless of social class.' Voters, he said, are viewing Tuesday's elections 'as a moment of revenge.' Dalmau said he would oust both companies in an 'organized fashion' within six months if he becomes governor. Ortiz said he would cancel Luma's contract, while González has called for the creation of an 'energy czar' that would review potential Luma contractual breaches while another operator is found. However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval of the federal control board and Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau. The candidates also are under pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crimes, boost Puerto Rico's economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a crumbling health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland. Dalmau, who suspended his campaign for two weeks in mid-October after his wife had emergency brain surgery, also has said he would eliminate tax breaks for wealthy U.S. citizens from the mainland. Apathy dominates Despite their promises to turn Puerto Rico around, candidates face persistent voter apathy. In 2008, 1.9 million out of 2.5 million registered voters participated in that year's election, compared with 1.3 million out of 2.3 million in 2020. This year, nearly 99,000 new voters registered and more than 87,000 reactivated their status, according to Puerto Rico's State Elections Commission. 'A much higher number was expected,' Schmidt said. He noted that those middle age and older favor González and her pro-statehood party, while those younger than 45 'overwhelmingly' favor Dalmau, which means that if a majority of young voters participate on Tuesday and fewer older ones do so, he might have a chance of winning. The Bad Bunny factor The months leading up to the Nov. 5 elections have been contentious. Reggaetón superstar Bad Bunny paid for dozens of billboard ads criticizing Puerto Rico's two main parties. In response, the governor's New Progressive Party financed a billboard ad suggesting an obscenity in reference to Bad Bunny. On Friday, the singer published a page-long letter in a local newspaper deriding González's pro-statehood party. While the artist has not endorsed any local officials, the sole person he recently began following on Instagram was Dalmau. On Sunday, he briefly appeared at Dalmau's closing campaign. A hush fell over a crowd of tens of thousands of people as Bad Bunny spoke before singing, saying he doesn't endorse a specific candidate or party. 'My party is the people. ... My party is Puerto Rico,' he said as he later praised the alliance between Puerto Rico's Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement. Meanwhile, a so-called 'cemetery of corruption' was set up Thursday in the capital, San Juan, featuring large black-and-white pictures of nearly a dozen politicians from the island's two main parties who have been charged or sentenced by federal authorities in recent years. It was created by Eva Prados with the Citizen Victory Movement, who is running for Puerto Rico's House. By Friday, police reported that the pictures were destroyed or stolen. As the race heats up, the number of formal complaints about alleged electoral crimes also has increased. These include people who say they received confirmations for early voting when they made no such request. A persistent question Voters on Tuesday also will be asked for a seventh time what Puerto Rico's political status should be. The nonbinding referendum will feature three choices: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated. Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from the U.S. Congress. The push for a change in status doesn't depend on whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump win in the U.S. mainland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/puerto-rico-prepares-for-election-day-as-a-third-party-candidate-makes-history/7850265.html	2024-11-03T19:22:24-08:00	
China urges France to get EU to arrive at palatable EV trade solution	BEIJING — China has urged France to take on 'an active role' to push the European Commission toward a solution acceptable to both the European and Chinese electric vehicle industries, Beijing's commerce ministry said on Monday, citing its minister. Wang Wentao, in a meeting with French junior trade minister Sophie Primas in Shanghai on Sunday, reiterated the European Union's investigation into China's EVs is a major concern and has 'seriously hindered' China-EU auto industry cooperation. The EU launched an anti-subsidy investigation into imports of Chinese-made battery EVs last year and in October voted for tariffs on those vehicles. China in the past year has launched its own investigations into European pork and dairy, and imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the EU early this month. Primas is on a three-day visit to challenge China over its import duties on brandy, which Paris calls political and unjustified, Reuters reported last week. Wang told Primas China's trade remedy investigations on EU brandy, pork and dairy products were in accordance with the domestic industry's applications and complied with the World Trade Organization rules, 'unlike the EU' which was 'rash' in launching its EV probe. 'China will continue to conduct investigations in strict accordance with the law, safeguard the legitimate rights of enterprises of EU member states, including France, and make rulings based on facts and evidence,' the ministry statement cited Wang as saying. But he said China is willing to work with the European Commission towards a 'proper solution' as well, without elaborating. China opened an anti-subsidy probe into imported EU dairy products in August and an investigation focusing on pork intended for human consumption in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-france-to-get-eu-to-arrive-at-palatable-ev-trade-solution/7850250.html	2024-11-03T18:41:55-08:00	
African Union soldiers killed in al-Shabab mortar attack	Two African Union soldiers were killed and a third one injured by an al-Shabab mortar attack Sunday on their base inside the perimeters of Mogadishu’s international airport. A statement by the head of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) and Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Mohamed El-Amine Souef condemned the attack on the facility known as the Halane Base Camp. It’s believed that a 107mm rocket was used for the attack. At least four mortar rounds were reportedly fired during the attack. 'The heinous attack will not deter us and the Somali security forces from pursuing lasting peace and in Somalia,' Souef said in the statement posted on X, formerly Twitter. 'We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to combat terrorism and build a peaceful and prosperous Somalia.' The statement did not specify the nationality of the soldiers killed, but an AU official told VOA’s Horn of Africa that the soldiers who were killed and the one soldier injured are Ugandans. 'ATMIS extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families, friends, and relatives of those who lost their lives and wishes a quick recovery to those injured during the attack,' Souef said. The AU senior leadership team later visited the site of the blasts. The al-Shabab militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement posted on one of its websites, the group claimed the mortars killed 'white and black officers.' Despite being driven out of Mogadishu in 2011, the group, from time to time, manages to carry out mortar attacks that hit Mogadishu’s airport, which is a base for the AU as well as some foreign embassies. Al-Shabab mortars have also targeted residential areas in Mogadishu and have claimed the lives of civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-union-soldiers-killed-in-al-shabab-mortar-attack/7850242.html	2024-11-03T18:15:23-08:00	
Pumpkins at center of fall celebration at Maryland farm	Although Halloween has passed, pumpkins are still an indispensable part of the fall season in the United States. Americans are expected to spend nearly $800 million on the decorative gourds this year. For many, heading to a pumpkin patch and picking a pumpkin is an annual tradition.

Federal judge lets Iowa challenge voter rolls; may affect naturalized citizens	DES MOINES, Iowa — A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting rights of people who’ve recently become U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials. The state’s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House. In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S. citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court's recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to 'act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,' he wrote. Locher also said the state's effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots. In a statement Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, celebrated the ruling. 'Today’s ruling is a victory for election integrity,' Reynolds said. 'In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the law and ensure those votes aren’t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a non-citizen.' A spokesperson for the ACLU said the organization did not immediately have a comment. After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU’s lawsuit Friday, Secretary of State Paul Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote, but the Biden administration wouldn’t provide data about them. Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when they previously sought driver’s licenses. 'Today’s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,' Bird said in the statement issued after Sunday's decision. But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn’t have been included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens’ voting rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating them if they cast ballots. Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5 election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a move so close to Election Day. 'It’s very clear that the secretary of state understands that this list consists primarily or entirely of U.S. citizens who have exactly the same fundamental core right to vote as the rest of us citizen Iowa voters,' Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the ACLU of Iowa, said during a Zoom briefing for reporters after the hearing. The people on the state’s list of potential noncitizens may have become naturalized citizens after their statements to the Department of Transportation. Pate’s office told county elections officials to challenge their ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their U.S. citizenship. In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate's attorney said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have proven citizenship at a polling place. Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to vote, and the first question on Iowa’s voter registration form asks whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Locher’s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S. Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens. In Iowa’s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a tiny fraction of the state’s 2.2 million registered voters. But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion of the names on Pate’s list are registered voters who are not U.S. citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he added. Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal fight over this year’s election for months. Republicans have filed dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-judge-lets-iowa-challenge-voter-rolls-may-affect-naturalized-citizens-/7850224.html	2024-11-03T17:08:16-08:00	
Japan grounds its V-22 Osprey fleet again after flight incident	Washington — Japan has grounded its fleet of V-22 Osprey aircraft again after an incident last Sunday where one of the hybrid helicopter-aircraft tilted unexpectedly and hit the ground while trying to take off. The V-22 was taking part in the joint U.S. military exercise Keen Sword and carrying 16 passengers, including three U.S. service members. During takeoff it 'became unstable as it swayed from side to side, and the left wing, the lower part of the aircraft came into contact with the ground and part of the aircraft was damaged, so the flight was aborted,' Japan's Ground Self Defense Forces said in a statement. It was the first major incident involving Japan's V-22 fleet since a U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command Osprey crash last November off the coast of Japan killed eight service members and led to a monthslong grounding of the entire fleet for both Japan and the U.S. The aircraft resumed flight operations earlier this year, but the Osprey’s use remains controversial particularly in Okinawa, where residents have questioned its safety record. The Osprey in last Sunday's incident was able to land and no one was injured, however Japan will keep its fleet of more than a dozen V-22s grounded while it investigates the incident, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters last week. 'We believe there is no safety problem with Ospreys, although ensuring flight safety is a prerequisite for aircraft operations,' Nakatani said. The Pentagon's V-22 joint program office is supporting Japan's investigation into the incident, spokesperson Neil Lobeda said Saturday. The V-22 was operating on the Japanese island of Yonaguni during the joint exercise Keen Sword. Yonaguni is only 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-grounds-its-v-22-osprey-fleet-again-after-flight-incident/7850209.html	2024-11-03T16:25:16-08:00	
Israel sends troops into Syria, detaining alleged Iranian agent	Israel said Sunday it launched a ground raid into Syria, seizing a Syrian it claimed was involved in Iranian networks supporting militants in the region. The Israeli raid into Syria was its first during the current 13-month Middle East conflict. Syria did not immediately confirm the operation. The Israeli army did not say where the raid occurred or when, but identified the man seized as Ali Soleiman al-Assi and said he had been living in the southern Syrian region of Saida. Israel said he had been under military surveillance for many months and was involved in Iranian initiatives targeting areas of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights near the border with Syria. Body camera footage of the raid released by the army showed soldiers seizing a man in a white tank top inside a building. The man was brought to Israel for interrogation, the military said. Elsewhere on the war front, an airstrike on a clinic in northern Gaza, where children were being vaccinated for polio, wounded six people, including four children, Palestinian officials said. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged Israeli drone strike occurred Saturday. The area has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel had been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza, saying Hamas uses them to hide militant fighters, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Hamas fighters are also operating in the north, battling Israeli forces. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. She said the attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border with Lebanon on Sunday, saying that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon must be pushed back beyond the Litani River, with or without a cease-fire deal in place, and that the Iran-backed group must be prevented from rearming. The river is about 30 kilometers north of the Israeli border. 'With or without an agreement, the key to returning our (evacuated) residents in the north safely to their homes is to keep back Hezbollah beyond the Litani, to strike its every attempt [to] rearm, and to respond forcefully against all action against us,' Netanyahu said. Israel continued to launch strikes in eastern Lebanon and in Gaza, while Israel said more than 100 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory Sunday. Several were intercepted, and some fell in unpopulated areas. More than a year ago, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terror group by the United States and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sends-troops-into-syria-detaining-alleged-iranian-agent/7850206.html	2024-11-03T16:11:28-08:00	
Second Taiwanese fighter killed in Ukraine	Taipei, Taiwan — A second Taiwanese volunteer fighting alongside Ukrainian soldiers against Russia has been killed, Taiwan's foreign ministry said Sunday. The man was a member of the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, the ministry said in a statement, expressing condolences to his family, who did not want him publicly identified. The ministry said it was informed of the man's death Saturday and that Taiwan's representative office in Poland had verified the information with the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. No further details were released about how he died. At the start of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly invited foreigners to come to his country to join a 'foreign legion' that would fight alongside Ukrainians against the invading Russians. Taiwanese media reported that the soldier returned to Ukraine in July after recovering from a leg injury. There are currently 'five to six' Taiwanese fighters in Ukraine, Taiwanese lawmaker Puma Shen, a member of the parliamentary defense committee, told AFP. The first Taiwanese volunteer died on the battlefield in Ukraine in November 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-taiwanese-fighter-killed-in-ukraine/7849941.html	2024-11-03T15:51:28-08:00	
China: Astronauts from Tiangong space station return to Earth	Beijing — A Chinese crew of three astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a stay of more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station, the Xinhua news agency reported. Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu were 'in good health' after landing in their return capsule at the Dongfeng site in Inner Mongolia, the agency said. The three men arrived at the Tiangong station in late April and were joined there on October 30 by three new astronauts, two men and a woman, with whom they undertook a five-day handover before beginning their return journey. The Tiangong space station, crewed by teams of three astronauts who rotate every three to six months, is the jewel of China's space program. Its central module was launched in 2021 and is expected to be used for around ten years. Beijing says it is on track to send a manned mission to the moon by 2030, where it plans to build a base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-astronauts-from-tiangong-space-station-return-to-earth/7849937.html	2024-11-03T15:34:10-08:00	
Taiwan reports rise in Chinese military activity as US election nears	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry said Sunday it had spotted 35 Chinese military aircraft, including fighters and bombers, flying to the island's south on the way to exercises in the Pacific, a second day in a row it has reported such activities. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite the strong objections of the government in Taipei, regularly sends its military in the skies and waters near the island seeking to enforce its sovereignty claims. China's defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the missions, reported just days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, and its arms sales to Taipei, including a $2 billion missile system announced last month, which infuriated Beijing. Taiwan's defense ministry said that from 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) Sunday it had detected 37 Chinese military aircraft, including J-16 fighters, nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and drones. Of those, 35 aircraft flew to Taiwan's southwest, south and southeast into the Western Pacific to carry out long-range training, the ministry said, adding it had sent its own forces to keep watch. On Saturday, the ministry said China had carried out another 'joint combat readiness patrol' with warships and aircraft near Taiwan. China last month held large war games around Taiwan it said were a warning to 'separatist acts,' drawing condemnation from the Taiwanese and U.S. governments. Beijing strongly dislikes Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, saying he is a 'separatist.' He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing but been rebuffed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-reports-rise-in-chinese-military-activity-as-us-election-nears/7849933.html	2024-11-03T15:19:51-08:00	
5 migrants die trying to reach Spain's Canary Islands	Madrid — Five bodies were found floating in the sea Sunday after the inflatable boat they were travelling in punctured around 90 km (56 miles) off the Spanish island of Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, Spanish Sea Rescue services told Reuters. A spokesperson said a rescue aircraft sighted two inflatable boats heading toward the archipelago, and that one of them had one of its floats deflated. The aircraft launched two life rafts and was able to rescue 17 people from one vessel and 80 from another, but five bodies were also found. State agency EFE said the rescue services had rescued more than 1,500 people over the weekend. It also reported Sunday that at least 48 migrants died trying to reach the Canary Islands in a boat that departed Mauritania three weeks ago. Ten more migrants from the same craft were rescued near the island of El Hierro on Saturday, it said. Calm seas and gentle winds associated with late summer in the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa have prompted a surge of migrants trying to escape extreme poverty and political instability in Africa's Sahel region. The Atlantic route to the Canary Islands has seen the fastest growth in irregular migration in recent years, though numbers remain below those on the Central Mediterranean route toward Italy. Some 32,878 migrants took the route in boats from West Africa to the Canary Islands between January and Oct. 15, according to government figures, a rise of 39.7% from the same period last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-die-trying-to-reach-spain-canary-islands/7849913.html	2024-11-03T13:44:03-08:00

Iran president says potential cease-fire 'could affect' response to Israel	Tehran — Iran's president said Sunday a potential cease-fire between its allies and Israel 'could affect the intensity' of Tehran's response to Israel's recent strikes on Iranian military sites. 'If they [the Israelis] reconsider their behavior, accept a cease-fire and stop massacring the oppressed and innocent people of the region, it could affect the intensity and type of our response,' Masoud Pezeshkian said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. He added that Iran 'will not leave unanswered any aggression against its sovereignty and security,' according to the news agency. Israeli warplanes carried out the October 26 strikes in what Israel said was retaliation for Tehran's October 1 missile barrage. Iran had in turn described that attack as a reprisal for the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Since the strikes last month, Israel has warned Iran against retaliating, while Tehran vowed to respond. On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all matters of the state, said the Islamic republic would retaliate. 'The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front,' Khamenei said in a speech to students in Tehran. He was referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed armed groups that include Yemen's Houthi rebels, Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. After the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they 'hit Iran's defense capabilities and missile production.' Iran's armed forces said the attack killed four military personnel and caused 'limited damage' to a few radar systems. Iranian media said a civilian was also killed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7849830.html	2024-11-03T10:33:27-08:00	
UN expert: Iran transformed Yemen's Houthi rebels into potent military force	UNITED NATIONS — Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report. The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran’s self-described 'Axis of Resistance' to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council. To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area. Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately. Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024. 'The group’s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,' the U.N. experts said. 'Such a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.' In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2. The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia. The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, 'has now escalated into a major international crisis.' According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015. 'The panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,' the report said. The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians. Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn’t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said. 'The scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military material and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,' the experts said. The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives 'aimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.' Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. 'The internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,' it said. The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said. 'Exploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,' they said. 'Recruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.' Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen’s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat — and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-expert-iran-transformed-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-into-potent-military-force/7849814.html	2024-11-03T10:15:22-08:00	
Return of abducted lawyer for Pakistan’s jailed former leader sparks controversy	Islamabad — A leading lawyer for Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan has resurfaced under mysterious circumstances nearly a month after his alleged 'enforced disappearance.' Police officials and Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party Sunday confirmed the overnight recovery of Intazar Ahmad Panjutha — who had gone missing on October 8 while returning home to Islamabad — amid allegations that government security agencies were involved. Punjutha’s recovery occurred a day after Pakistan's attorney general assured a federal high court Friday that the lawyer 'would be recovered within 24 hours' but did not provide further details. However, police reported late Saturday that they intercepted a suspicious vehicle in the city of Hassan Abdul, northwest of the Pakistani capital, and recovered the lawyer, asserting that armed individuals who were with Panjutha opened fire at police from within the vehicle and fled. A video later surfaced showing a visibly shaken and weak Panjutha sitting in a vehicle with his hands and feet tied. In a separate video, the lawyer can be seen breaking down in tears while telling police officers that his captors were demanding ransom and subjected him to severe custodial torture. Khan’s party rejected the police claims and Panjutha’s video remarks, saying he was forced to make the statement and alleging again that the lawyer 'was abducted by security forces.' Salman Akram Raja, the secretary general of PTI, identified Panjutha as one of Khan's key lawyers in his ongoing legal battles. 'His condition, that spoke of the horror he had endured, was filmed and spread to cause fear. This is shameful,' Raja said in a video statement he released Sunday. A police department spokesperson dismissed allegations of staging a fake encounter, asserting that officers rescued Panjutha from kidnappers demanding ransom. Absa Komal, a prime-time news anchor at Pakistan's Dawn TV channel, commented on Panjutha’s video appearance and sympathized with him. 'He is unrecognizable — a changed man. The attorney general told the high court that he would be produced in 24 hours, and this is how he has been presented. Shame on the decision-makers,' Komal wrote on her social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Khan’s party members and supporters have been the subject of a government crackdown since he was removed from power through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in 2022 and jailed a year later over controversial allegations of corruption and inciting violence against the Pakistani military, among dozens of other charges. The 72-year-old deposed leader rejects the lawsuits as fabricated by the military after allegedly orchestrating his ouster from power, charges government and army officials reject. Domestic and international human rights groups have lately intensified their criticism of Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of suppressing PTI and dissent at large. Khan, cricket star-turned-prime minister, has led a campaign of defiance against the military since his ouster from power. Army generals have staged three coups and ruled Pakistan for over three decades since it gained independence in 1947. Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are frequently accused of influencing the rise or fall of elected governments through election rigging and pro-army political parties, charges army officials deny. Last month, more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners in Pakistan. The American lawmakers expressed their concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in the South Asian nation. Without naming Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, the letter stated that 'Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.’' Islamabad hit back at the letter, saying it is based on 'an incorrect understanding of the political situation in Pakistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/return-of-abducted-lawyer-for-pakistan-s-jailed-former-leader-sparks-controversy-/7849779.html	2024-11-03T09:20:02-08:00	
Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya win New York City Marathon	New York — Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands won the men's race at the New York City Marathon on Sunday and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya took the women's event. Both runners pulled away from their closest competitors in the final few hundred meters to come away with their first victories in the race. Nageeye was step-for-step with 2022 champion Evans Chebet before using a burst heading into Central Park to come away with the win in 2 hours, 7 minutes, 39 seconds. Chebet finished 6 seconds behind. Chepkirui was running New York for the first time and pulled away from defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women's race. Chepkirui started to run marathons in 2022. She finished the race in 2:24.35. Obiri finished nearly 15 seconds behind. Obiri was looking to be the first repeat champion since Mary Keitany of Kenya won three in a row from 2014-16. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya finished third, giving the African nation the top three spots. Tamirat Tola, the men's defending champion and Paris Olympic gold medalist, finished fourth, right behind Albert Korir. The top Americans finished sixth in both races. Conner Mantz led the men and Sara Vaughn the women. Vaughn was in the lead group heading into Mile 20 when they entered the Bronx before she dropped off the lead pack. Vaughn was geared up to run Chicago before COVID-19 kept her from competing in that race. She was a late addition to this marathon. The day got started with an upset in the men's wheelchair race as three-time defending champion Marcel Hug was beaten by Daniel Romanchuk, who won in 2018 and 2019. Susannah Scaroni won the women’s wheelchair race. It was her second victory in New York, also taking the 2022 race and giving Americans winners in both events — the first time that has happened. The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This is the 48th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route was completely in Central Park when it began in 1970. The first race had only 55 finishers while more than 50,000 are expected to compete this year. The weather was perfect to run in with temperatures in the lower 40s when the race started. Last year, it was 61 degrees when the race started.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abdi-nageeye-of-the-netherlands-and-sheila-chepkirui-of-kenya-win-new-york-city-marathon/7849762.html	2024-11-03T08:52:38-08:00	
Russia sends nearly 100 drones into Ukraine, as Zelenskyy urges tougher sanctions against Moscow	Kyiv, Ukraine — Moscow sent 96 drones and a guided air missile into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's Air Force, 66 drones were destroyed during the overnight barrage, along with the missile. A further 27 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed, while one drone flew into Belarusian airspace. No casualties were reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, 500 drones and 30 missiles against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed Sunday on X to Ukraine's allies to provide 'long-range capabilities for our security', saying that these 'attacks would have been impossible if we had sufficient support from the world.' Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil, including for preemptive Ukrainian strikes on camps where North Korean troops are being trained. The Ukrainian President also urged partners to enact 'truly effective sanctions to prevent Russia from importing critical components for drone and missile production'. This appeal followed an address on Saturday, in which he said over 2,000 drones and missiles 'still using Western components' were launched against Ukraine in October, and underlined the need for more stringent export controls to prevent sanctions evasion. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 19 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in three regions of Russia: 16 in the Rostov region, two in the Belgorod region and one in the Volgograd region. A man died Sunday in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sends-nearly-100-drones-into-ukraine-as-zelenskyy-urges-tougher-sanctions-against-moscow/7849741.html	2024-11-03T08:28:26-08:00	
Wikipedia embroiled in legal battle in India	A monthslong legal battle between online encyclopedia Wikipedia’s parent company and India’s largest newswire service took a turn this week that has raised concerns about free access to credible online information in the country. In July, Asian News International (ANI), which calls itself South Asia’s leading multimedia news agency, filed a lawsuit in the Delhi High Court against the U.S.-based Wikimedia Foundation over a Wikipedia page that labeled ANI a mouthpiece of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. The foundation runs Wikipedia. The content on Wikipedia is managed by volunteers, and it allows all users free editing access to its pages. During a hearing in the $237,000 [approx.] defamation lawsuit on October 28, Wikimedia relented to the High Court’s demand that Wikipedia reveal identifying information of the online users involved in editing the ANI page. In August, the court had threatened to halt the operation of the widely used website in India if it did not comply. Indian tech journalist and digital rights activist Nikhil Pahwa said that if the precedent set by the ANI lawsuit against Wikimedia holds, it will make editors across Wikipedia vulnerable to defamation cases from any political actor who has an issue with their Wikipedia page. 'This means that anyone who edits a Wikipedia page is potentially susceptible to identification because all one has to do is file a case. In the case of politicians especially, the edits will be fraught with risk. This will mean that Wikipedia editors will hesitate when editing pages pertaining to powerful people, and this has a chilling effect on speech,' Pahwa told VOA. ANI, which also accused Wikipedia of spreading information from 'fake news websites,' had demanded in the lawsuit that the website’s page on the newswire service be taken down. Wikimedia initially argued that the pages on ANI were entirely written by volunteers who simply made use of an online platform provided by Wikipedia. But on October 16, the court ordered Wikimedia to take down a page concerning ANI, saying that its existence was 'interfering' with the court proceedings. In an unprecedented move, Wikipedia removed the page from its platform on October 21. On October 25, the Delhi High Court expressed surprise at the open-access editing function of Wikipedia, calling it a 'dangerous tool.' Justice Subramonium Prasad, during a hearing on the case, asked: 'Anybody can edit a page on Wikipedia? What kind of page is this if it is open to anybody [to edit]?' A history of censorship Wikipedia has faced bans or censorship intermittently in more than a dozen countries. The site has also faced lawsuits filed by individuals as well as organizations across borders. China banned the Chinese language version of Wikipedia in 2015. Four years later, it blocked all language editions of the free, community-edited encyclopedia in the country. Pakistan blocked the website for three days last year for hosting allegedly blasphemous content. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later ordered the restoration of the site, noting that the consequences of the blanket ban outweighed its benefits. In 2023, a court in Russia imposed a fine worth $20,350 on Wikimedia for not deleting what it claimed was 'banned content' regarding the Russian military. The fine was for the failure to take down a page that contained 'classified military information' about Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, among other content on its location and equipment. Global popularity Wikipedia insists that despite being a community-driven platform, it has a robust fact-checking system. Wikipedia also maintains the anonymity of its volunteers who edit and verify information from different sources. Wikipedia, available in many languages and with more than 350 editions, is consistently one of the most visited websites in the world and is used by millions of people for a variety of purposes. New Delhi-based lawyer Ujjaini Chatterji said that Wikipedia is a very useful first step for any research. 'It is especially helpful because they have a lot of other links within the footnotes which direct us to other credible articles, journals, academic literature, media coverage, databases and more, in order to build on our research further,' she said. 'This free source encyclopedia is particularly a useful starting point to understanding concepts in a simplified manner. Like many others in India, I have used Wikipedia, both as a student and a professional,' she added. Indian residents visit Wikipedia more than 750 million times per month, making it the online encyclopedia’s fifth-largest user base in the world. The site operates in 23 Indian languages besides English. The outcome of the lawsuit, which is already resolved at this point, may affect hundreds of thousands of Indians in the future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wikipedia-embroiled-in-legal-battle-in-india/7849693.html	2024-11-03T07:27:21-08:00	
Protesters demand arrests over train station roof collapse that killed 14 people in Serbia	BELGRADE — Angry protesters on Sunday left red handprints at the entrances of government buildings in the Serbian capital to demand the arrest of officials, two days after a concrete canopy collapsed at a railway station, killing 14 people and injuring three. Police formed a cordon outside the seat of the Ministry of Construction and Infrastructure in central Belgrade as several thousand people called for ranking government ministers, including Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, to immediately step down. 'Arrest, arrest!' chanted the crowd. They shouted at police officers outside the building that they are 'guarding murderers' and that 'your hands are bloody,' while holding banners reading 'corruption kills' and 'we are all under the canopy!' 'Everywhere you can, leave bloody hands so they know their hands are bloody. In every city in Serbia, everywhere you can,' opposition political activist Nikola Ristic said. The concrete canopy that ran along the front of the railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed suddenly on Friday, landing on people who were sitting on benches or passing through the building's entrance. Surveillance camera footage showed the canopy crashing down in seconds. The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Sunday, doctors said. Funerals for the victims, attended by thousands, have been held in northern Serbia. The train station has been renovated twice in recent years, and critics of Serbia's populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, lack of transparency and sloppy renovations. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies. 'Citizens no longer have anything to lose, they are increasingly becoming aware of this,' said liberal politician Biljana Stojkovic. 'This is grief combined with anger, despair that is turning into rage.' Serbia's populist government has promised a thorough investigation, with prosecutors saying they already have questioned more than two dozen people. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation why this wasn't done. The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-demand-arrests-over-train-station-roof-collapse-that-killed-14-people-in-serbia-/7849674.html	2024-11-03T06:48:35-08:00	
14 people killed when lightning hits church in remote refugee camp in Uganda	KAMPALA — Fourteen people were killed in a lightning strike in a refugee camp in northern Uganda, police said Sunday. The incident happened Saturday in the remote district of Lamwo. Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said 34 other people were injured. The victims have not yet been identified, he said. The residents of the Palabek settlement camp, which primarily houses refugees from South Sudan, had been attending a prayer service in the makeshift metallic structure when the lighting struck. Deadly lightning is commonly reported in this East African country during the wet seasons. Rusoke said there was no report of fire breaking out following the strike.	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-killed-when-lightning-hits-a-church-in-a-remote-refugee-camp-in-uganda-/7849454.html	2024-11-03T05:52:04-08:00	
A crowd of Spain's flood survivors toss mud and shout insults at King Felipe VI	VALENCIA, Spain — A crowd of angry survivors of Spain's floods tossed mud and shouted insults at Spain's King Felipe VI and government officials when they made their first visit to one of the hardest hit towns on Sunday. Government officials accompanied the monarch who tried to talk to locals while others shouted at him in Paiporta, an outskirt of Valencia city that has been devastated. Police had to step in with officers on horseback to keep back the crowd of several dozens. 'Get out! Get out!' and 'Killers!' rang out among other insults. After being forced to seek protection from the mud, the king remained calm and made several efforts to speak to individual residents. One person appeared to have wept on his shoulder. He shook the hand of a man. It was an unprecedented incident for a Royal House that takes great care to craft an image of a monarch who is liked by the nation. Queen Letizia and regional Valencia President Carlo Mazón were also in the contingent. Over 200 people have died from Tuesday's floods and thousands have had their homes destroyed by the wall of water and mud. At least 60 of the dead were in Paiporta, an epicenter of suffering.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-pm-king-heckled-on-visit-to-flood-hit-area-/7849424.html	2024-11-03T05:21:56-08:00	
Amid war and deep hunger, Gaza fisherman struggle to feed families	KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — After over a year of war in Gaza, Palestinian fishermen gather along the coastline, desperately casting their nets in hopes of catching enough for their families amid widespread hunger. Since Israel began a military onslaught in Gaza after Hamas' October 2023 attack, Israeli restrictions in the waters off the enclave have made life almost impossible for fishermen, who no longer sail out to sea and instead must stay by the shore. In Khan Younis, Ibrahim Ghurab, 71, and Waseem Al Masry, 24, fish for sardines from the shoreline in front of a encampment of tents and makeshift shelters for those displaced by the war. 'Life is difficult,' Ghurab said. 'One tries to secure food. There is no aid, we don't receive anything anymore. In the beginning there was some [humanitarian] aid, very little, but now there is no more.' Fishermen like Ghurab and Al Masry struggle daily to bring in even a modest catch to feed their families. There is rarely any fish left over from a daily haul to be sold to others. Fishing was an important part of daily life in Gaza before the war, helping people eke out a living by selling their daily hauls in the market and feed the population. But scant aid is reaching Gaza amid Israeli restrictions and frequent fighting, and many people have no income. The price of simple goods are largely out of reach for most. 'We have to come here and risk our lives,' Al Masry said, describing shootings by the Israeli military from the sea that he accused of targeting fisherman on the beach in Khan Younis. Ghurab similarly said that Israeli military boats had fired upon fisherman at Khan Younis. The Israeli military did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the claims the military had shot at fishermen. Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas for the Islamist militant group's deadly, cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023 has devastated densely populated Gaza and displaced most of the 2.3 million population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-war-and-deep-hunger-gaza-fisherman-struggle-to-feed-families-/7849422.html	2024-11-03T05:09:56-08:00	
A grenade explosion in busy market in Indian-controlled Kashmir wounds 9	SRINAGAR, India — An assailant threw a grenade at a marketplace bustling with shoppers in the main city of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Sunday, wounding at least nine people, police said. The attack comes a day after a suspected militant was killed in a daylong gunbattle in Srinagar, a rare occurrence in the city where security is tight. Police said an unidentified attacker hurled a grenade from a flyover bridge, apparently targeting a stationed paramilitary vehicle, in the main business center of Srinagar, where Sunday's flea market is visited by thousands of people. The grenade exploded in the midst of shoppers and vendors, wounding at least nine, police said. All were taken to a hospital and reinforcements of police and paramilitary soldiers launched a search for the attacker. In the past, Indian authorities have blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region for similar grenade attacks. Rebels have in turn accused government agents of carrying out the attacks to defame their movement. 'There can be no justification for targeting innocent civilians,' Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote on the social media platform X. 'The security apparatus must do everything possible to end this spurt of attacks at the earliest so that people can go about their lives without any fear.' India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-grenade-explosion-in-a-busy-market-in-indian-controlled-kashmir-wounds-9-/7849413.html	2024-11-03T04:56:14-08:00	
Germany's Scholz summons top ministers over rival plans to fix economy	Berlin — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will hold meetings with his top two ministers to try to find common ground after they put forward contradictory plans to fix the nation's ailing economy, a government source told Reuters on Sunday. A document leaked by Christian Lindner's finance ministry raised eyebrows in Berlin last week, with its push for tax cuts and fiscal discipline widely interpreted as a challenge to the multibillion-euro investment plan put forward by Economy Minister Robert Habeck just days earlier. The stand-off is the latest escalation in a row over economic and industrial policy between the FDP, the Greens and Scholz's Social Democrats that has fueled speculation of the coalition's potential collapse, less than a year before elections are due. But a government source told Reuters that Scholz and the ministers would hold several meetings in the coming days, saying that 'now that everyone has submitted their paper, we have to see how they fit with each other.' A worsening business outlook in Europe's largest economy has widened divisions in Scholz's ideologically disparate coalition over policy measures to drive growth, protect industrial jobs, and reinforce Germany’s position as a global industrial hub. While Habeck wants the creation of a fund to stimulate investment and to get around Germany's strict fiscal spending rules, Lindner advocates tax cuts to spur the economy and an immediate halt on all new regulation. SPD leader Lars Klingbeil signaled openness to discussing Lindner's proposals in a local newspaper interview, but said that some of them were untenable for his party, which released its own economic plan earlier in October. 'Giving more to the rich, letting employees work longer and sending them into retirement later - it will come as no surprise to anyone that we think this is the wrong approach,' Klingbeil told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-scholz-summons-top-ministers-over-rival-plans-to-fix-economy-/7849402.html	2024-11-03T04:32:26-08:00	
Mpox cases in Congo may be stabilizing, but more vaccines needed to stamp out virus	Goma, Congo — Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be 'stabilizing' — a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline. In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That’s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged. But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested — and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda. While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received — 265,000 — and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million. Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation. 'If we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,' said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima. So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo. 'We’ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,' he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries. Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga — where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners — is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education. Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn’t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo. 'They told us we're highly exposed to the risk of infection,' she said. 'We insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don’t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.' Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox — but it wasn’t the money that swayed her. 'The vaccine is also necessary,' she said. 'I think we’re now protected.' The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year. Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain. Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the International Rescue Committee. 'We only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,' she said. The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots. 'We’re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,' said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. 'What we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.' Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible. The advocacy group Public Citizen estimated UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs. Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa’s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus’ transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals. 'We’re in new territory with mpox this time,' he added. 'But we’re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-cases-in-congo-may-be-stabilizing-but-more-vaccines-needed-to-stamp-out-virus-/7849399.html	2024-11-03T04:21:25-08:00	
Lahore air pollution hits historic high, forcing school closures	KARACHI — Unprecedented air pollution levels in Pakistan's second-largest city of Lahore prompted authorities to take emergency measures on Sunday, including issuing work-from-home mandates and closing primary schools. The city held the top spot on a real-time list of the world's most polluted cities on Sunday after recording its highest ever pollution reading of 1900 near the Pakistan-India border on Saturday, based on data released by the provincial government and Swiss group IQAir. The government has shut primary schools for a week, advising parents to ensure children wear masks, said Senior Minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb during a press conference, as a thick blanket of smog enveloped the city. Citizens have been urged to stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, and avoid unnecessary travel, she said, adding that hospitals had been given smog counters. To reduce vehicle pollution, 50% of office employees would work from home, said Aurangzeb. The government has also imposed a ban on three-wheelers known as rickshaws and halted construction in certain areas to reduce the pollution levels. Factories and construction sites failing to comply with these regulations could be shut down, she said. Aurangzeb described the situation as 'unexpected' and attributed the deterioration in air quality to winds carrying pollution from neighboring India. 'This cannot be solved without talks with India,' she said, adding the provincial government would initiate talks with its bigger neighbor through Pakistan's foreign ministry. The smog crisis in Lahore, similar to the situation in India's capital Delhi, tends to worsen during cooler months due to temperature inversion trapping pollution closer to the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lahore-air-pollution-hits-historic-high-forcing-school-closures-/7849395.html	2024-11-03T04:12:12-08:00	
Turkey seeks deeper Africa ties at summit	Nairobi — Turkey on Sunday said it was committed to deepening relations with Africa, which it and called on to back diplomatic support for Palestinians, as it held its latest African summit in Djibouti. Turkey has invested heavily across Africa in recent years, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan carrying out 50 visits to 31 countries during his two decades in power. Fourteen African countries attended the latest ministerial meeting in the tiny Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti this weekend. They included Angola, Chad, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Libya, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who presided over the summit, said trade with the continent surpassed $35 billion last year and Turkey's direct investments now totaled $7 billion. 'Turkey is employing a comprehensive and holistic approach in terms of enhancing our trade and economic partnership with the continent,' Fidan said in a speech. Turkey has become the fourth largest arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa and helped train armed forces in many countries. In recent months, it has attempted to mediate a feud between Ethiopia and Somalia, and struck a mining deal with Niger. Fidan reiterated support for the African Union to become a permanent member of the G20, and for reform of the United Nations Security Council. 'We should continue our efforts to make the UN more relevant and capable of confronting the complex challenges of the century. Security Council reform is critical in this sense,' he said. Fidan also called for greater African involvement in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. 'We believe that Africa can play an instrumental role in supporting the Palestinian cause and in stopping Israel,' he said. 'We appreciate the African countries that stand with Palestine,' he added, highlighting South Africa's recent move to file evidence of 'genocide' committed by Israel to the International Criminal Court. The next Turkiye-Africa Summit is due to be held in 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-seeks-deeper-africa-ties-at-summit/7849389.html	2024-11-03T03:59:20-08:00	
Ethiopia bans imports of gas-powered private vehicles, but the switch to electric is a bumpy ride	ADDIS ABABA — As the price of fuel soared in Ethiopia earlier this year, Awgachew Seleshi decided to buy an electric car. That aligned with the government's new efforts to phase out gas-powered vehicles. But months later, he's questioning whether it was the right decision. He faces a range of issues, from the erratic supply of electricity in Addis Ababa, the capital, to the scarcity of spare parts. 'Charging my car has been a challenge,' the civil servant said. 'Spare parts that are imported from China are expensive, few mechanics are able to fix such cars and the resale value of such cars is poor.' Seleshi's troubles point to wider challenges for Ethiopia. In January, the East African country became the first in the world to ban the importation of non-electric private vehicles. The decision eased pressure on authorities who spend scarce foreign currency to subsidize the cost of fuel, but it also reflected growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles as the world demands more green technologies to reduce climate-changing emissions. Earlier this month, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8% as part of a plan to gradually end all fuel subsidies in Africa's second-most populous country. Authorities have claimed some success in enforcing the ban on non-electric vehicles entering Ethiopia, and more than 100,000 electric cars are now being imported into the country each month. The official target is to increase the monthly import figure to 500,000 by 2030. By that time, a big new dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile River is expected to be producing power at full capacity. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in a televised address earlier this year, said the Grand Renaissance Dam will start generating more than 5,000 megawatts of electric power within a year. Authorities say such capacity would support the transition to electric vehicles. For now, many in Addis Ababa, a city of more than 5 million people, are doubtful the country can achieve its ambitious goals for electric vehicles without further needed infrastructure and services. The few garage owners who can fix broken electric cars say they are overwhelmed, while customers say they are being overcharged amid an apparent lack of competition. 'There are two or three garages that can fix new energy vehicles in Ethiopia and many consumers lack awareness on how to take care of such vehicles,' said Yonas Tadelle, a mechanic in Addis Ababa. 'As mechanics, we also lack the tools, the spare parts and the know-how to fix such cars.' Many EVs are now parked in garages and parking lots awaiting parts expected to come from China. Ethiopia's minister in charge of transport, Bareo Hassen Bareo, has said he believes the country can be a model nation with a green economy legacy, with the prioritization of electric vehicles a key component. The government will invest in public charging stations, he told The Associated Press, and there are plans to create a plant manufacturing EV batteries locally to reduce reliance on imports. Private efforts have included a collaboration, which has since fizzled, between Olympian Haile Gebreselassie and South Korean carmaker Hyundai to make electric vehicles in Ethiopia. That effort is believed to have collapsed over the sourcing of materials. Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa, said the sudden flood of electric vehicles into the local market despite poor infrastructure is making it difficult for customers to adapt comfortably. Some EVs sell for about $20,000. 'Very few people are willing to take the risk of buying electric cars due to the lack of infrastructure, shortage of mechanics specialized in EV maintenance and the flooding of the market with Chinese brands that have questionable details and long-term visibility,' Berhane said. But he said he believes that Ethiopia is more than able to provide electricity to the expected 500,000 EV’s there within the next decade while fulfilling its industrial ambitions. Some Ethiopians are already giving up on electric vehicles, and the secondhand trade in gasoline-powered vehicles continues. There are at least 1.2 million vehicles across Ethiopia, and only a small fraction are electric ones. Businessman Yared Alemayehu bought a Chinese-made electric vehicle that he had hoped to use for a taxi service. He knew the car had a mechanical defect, but he believed it could be fixed. A mechanic disagreed. In the end, he sold the car at a loss and bought a Toyota Corolla — a car made in 2007 that he felt was more reliable — for the equivalent of $20,000, a sum that included the hefty taxes imposed on gasoline vehicles. Taxes can be higher than the cost of importing the vehicle. 'In addition to having to charge my old electric car, it frequently broke, and the garage was overcharging, and the lineup at the garage was overwhelming us,' he said. Taxi driver Dereje Hailu, who had high hopes for his Chinese-made E-Star electric vehicle when he purchased it earlier this year, said his expectations had been dashed. 'With such a car, I fear I might be stuck if I go far from Addis Ababa where there are no charging stations,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-bans-imports-of-gas-powered-private-vehicles-but-the-switch-to-electric-is-a-bumpy-ride-/7849387.html	2024-11-03T03:48:26-08:00	
Will people leave Florida after devastating hurricanes? History suggests not	orlando, florida — The news rippled through Treasure Island, Florida, almost like a third storm: The mayor planned to move off the barrier island a month after Hurricane Helene flooded tens of thousands of homes along the Gulf Coast and two weeks after Hurricane Milton also ravaged the state. Mayor Tyler Payne's home had been flooded and damaged beyond repair, he explained in a message to Treasure Island residents, and he and his husband can't afford to rebuild. He also was stepping down as mayor. 'While it pains my heart to make this decision in the midst of our recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, this is the best decision for me and my family,' Payne, who had held the office for more than three years and was a fourth-generation Treasure Island resident, said Monday. Up and down Florida's storm-battered Gulf Coast, residents are making the same calculations about whether they should stay or go. Can they afford to rebuild? What will insurance cover? People considering moving to Florida are contemplating whether it's worth the risk to come to a hurricane-prone state. These existential questions about Florida's appeal are raised regularly after the state experiences a busy hurricane season, such as in 2004, when four hurricanes crossed the Sunshine State. If moves into the state offer any answer, then hurricanes have served little as deterrents. Florida's population has grown by one-third to 23 million residents in the two decades since Charley, Frances, Jeanne and Ivan ravaged the state. Last year, Florida added more than 365,000 residents, second only to Texas among states. On the other hand, there are signs that Florida's white-hot real estate market has cooled. Sales of single-family homes were down 12% in September compared with the same time in the previous year. But interest rates, rising home prices and skyrocketing insurance costs likely played bigger roles than the recent hurricanes. 'Florida recovers much faster than you think,' said Brad O'Connor, chief economist for Florida Realtors. What happens after a storm? Studies of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast have shown that any outbound migration tends to be short-lived, and if people do leave, it's usually a short-distance move, such as from a barrier island to the mainland. Older people with more financial resources are more likely to return to devastated communities. When it comes to the housing market, there may be an initial shock to the supply as homeowners wait for reimbursement from insurance companies to fix up their homes or sell them. But in the three years after a hurricane, home prices in areas of Florida that were hit by one are 5% higher on average than elsewhere in the state because of smaller supply, according to a study of the impact of hurricanes on Florida's housing market from 2000 to 2016. New homeowners tend to be richer than previous ones because wealthier buyers can absorb price increases. Other factors that determine how quickly communities bounce back include whether homes were insured, the speed of insurance reimbursements, and whether there are enough construction workers. Because of stricter building codes implemented in the years after Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992, newer homes withstand hurricanes better than older ones, O'Connor said. 'If a property is damaged and uninsured, and the homeowner says, 'I don't want to deal with this,' there are always people willing to scoop up that property because it's valuable land,' he said. 'People build new homes under the new codes and there's less of an impact from hurricanes.' Short term and long term Recent storms offer examples what happens to communities, both short term and longer term. In Lee County, home to Fort Myers, Hurricane Ian made landfall two years ago in what had been one of the fastest growing parts of the United States. Population growth slowed afterward to 1.5% from 4.4% before the storm. The number of households dropped from about 340,000 to about 326,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2019, three-quarters of all United Van Lines truck moves were into Lee County and a quarter were outbound, but that dropped to two-thirds inbound and a third outbound in 2023 to 2024, the company told The Associated Press. The share of people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s increased, as did the share of men with no spouse or partner, reflecting an influx of construction and recovery workers. The share of the white population dropped while it increased for the Hispanic community. The percentage of utility and transportation workers in the county jumped, according to the Census Bureau. Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael made landfall as the first Category 5 hurricane on the continental U.S. in a quarter century in 2018, offers a portrait of longer term trends. Four years later, Bay County had recovered its pre-hurricane population, which dropped almost 6% in the year after the storm. Since Michael, the county has grown more diverse, wealthier and older, with the median age rising from 39.6 to 41.4 and more people identifying as multiracial or Hispanic. The share of households earning $200,000 or more went from 4.3% before the hurricane to 8.3% in 2022 in a sign that some of the least affluent residents couldn't afford to rebuild or return. Treasure Island's mayor In his message to constituents, Payne said he would still stay connected to the Treasure Island community because his parents plan to rebuild on the barrier island, one of a string of beach towns along the Gulf of Mexico west of St. Petersburg known for motels, restaurants and bars lining the street. Payne, an attorney who also is an executive in his family's eyeglass-lens manufacturing business, said in his message that his decision to move was 'difficult.' 'I completely empathize with the difficult decisions that are facing so many of our residents,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-people-leave-florida-after-devastating-hurricanes-history-suggests-not-/7848619.html	2024-11-03T01:42:57-08:00	
Opponents use parental rights, anti-trans messages to fight abortion ballot measures	CHICAGO — Billboards with the words 'STOP Child Gender Surgery.' Pamphlets warning about endangering minors. 'PROTECT PARENT RIGHTS' plastered on church bulletins. As voters in nine states determine whether to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions, opponents are using parental rights and anti-transgender messages to try to undermine support for the ballot proposals. The measures do not mention gender-affirming surgeries, and legal experts say changing existing parental notification and consent laws regarding abortions and gender-affirming care for minors would require court action. But anti-abortion groups hoping to end a losing streak at the ballot box have turned to the type of language many Republican candidates nationwide are using in their own campaigns as they seek to rally conservative Christian voters. 'It's really outlandish to suggest that this amendment relates to things like gender reassignment surgery for minors,' said Matt Harris, an associate professor of political science at Park University in Parkville, Missouri, a state where abortion rights are on the ballot. Since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections for abortion, voters in seven states, including conservative Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to curtail them. 'If you can't win by telling the truth, you need a better argument, even if that means capitalizing on the demonization of trans children,' said Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine physician in Omaha, Nebraska, where anti-abortion groups are using the strategy. Tying abortion-rights ballot initiatives to parental rights and gender-affirming is a strategy borrowed from playbooks used in Michigan and Ohio, where voters nonetheless enshrined abortion rights in the state constitutions. Both states still require minors to get parental consent for abortions, and the new amendments have not yet impacted parental involvement or gender-affirming care laws in either state, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. 'It's just recycling the same strategies,' Cohen said. In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, states where voters are considering constitutional amendments this fall are Montana, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota. Missouri's abortion ballot measure has especially become a target. The amendment would bar the government from infringing on a 'person's fundamental right to reproductive freedom.' Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, both Republicans, have claimed the proposal would allow minors to get abortions and gender-affirming surgeries without parental involvement. The amendment protects reproductive health services, 'including but not limited to' a list of items such as prenatal care, childbirth, birth control and abortion. It does not mention gender-affirming care, but Missouri state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican and lawyer with the conservative Thomas More Society, said it's possible that could be considered reproductive health services. Several legal experts told The Associated Press that would require a court ruling that is improbable. 'It would be a real stretch for any court to say that anything connected with gender-affirming care counts as reproductive health care,' said Saint Louis University law and gender studies professor Marcia McCormick. She noted that examples listed as reproductive health care in the Missouri amendment are all directly related to pregnancy. As for parental consent for minors' abortions, she pointed to an existing state law that is written similarly to one the U.S. Supreme Court found constitutional, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Most states have parental involvement laws, whether requiring parental consent or notification. Even many Democratic-leaning states with explicit protections for transgender rights require parental involvement before an abortion or gender-affirming care for minors, said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. A state high court would have to overturn such laws, which is highly unlikely from conservative majorities in many of the states with abortion on the ballot, experts said. In New York, a proposed amendment to the state constitution would expand antidiscrimination protections to include ethnicity, national origin, age, disability and 'sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health care and autonomy.' The constitution already bans discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion. The measure does not mention abortion. But because it is broader, it could be easier for opponents to attack it. But legal experts noted that it would also not change existing state laws related to parental involvement in minors getting abortions or gender-affirming care. The New York City Bar Association released a fact sheet explaining that the measure would not impact parental rights, 'which are governed by other developed areas of state and federal law.' Yet the Coalition to Protect Kids-NY calls it the 'Parent Replacement Act.' Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, the group behind South Dakota's proposed amendment said it uses the Roe v. Wade framework 'almost word for word.' 'All you have to do is look back at what was allowed under Roe, and there were always requirements for parental involvement,' Weiland said. Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Life Defense Fund, said the measure 'means loving parents will be completely cut out of the equation.' Weiland said those claims are part of a 'constant stream of misinformation' from opponents. If this campaign strategy failed in Michigan and Ohio, why are anti-abortion groups leaning on it for the November elections? Ziegler, the University of California, Davis, law professor, said abortion-rights opponents know they may be 'playing on more favorable terrain' in more conservative states like Missouri or in states like Florida that have higher thresholds for passing ballot measures. 'Anti-abortion groups are still looking for a winning recipe,' Ziegler said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/opponents-use-parental-rights-and-anti-trans-messages-to-fight-abortion-ballot-measures/7848620.html	2024-11-03T01:41:38-08:00	
America's holiday calendar is increasingly diverse	NEW YORK — John Albert's daughter didn't go to school on Friday. And he couldn't be happier about it. For the first time, the high school senior and all of New York City's public school students have the day off to mark the holiday of Diwali, celebrated in India and among the global Indian diaspora as the victory of light over darkness and marked by communities of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. To get the holiday added to the school calendar, where it joins other days off for Rosh Hashanah, Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr as well as federal holidays like Veterans Day, Christmas and Memorial Day, took years of pushing from those in New York's South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities like Albert. But it was worth it. 'It was this feeling of wanting to weave our culture into New York,' he said. From religious and cultural holidays to region-specific commemorations to days meant to honor the towering figures and moments of U.S. history, the holiday calendars across the 50 states and the country at large are increasingly diverse ones, a reflection of and a window into the many communities that make up the American whole. Recognizing holidays creates community Including a smaller culture's or community's special days as something to recognize in the larger general culture is an act of unity, said Lauren Strauss, professor of modern Jewish history at American University. 'By doing that in an American context and by including a Muslim feast for the end of Ramadan and by including Diwali and including Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my goodness. You're just saying it out loud, aren't you? You're saying that these cultures, these people, they aren't visitors, that they are a permanent part of this community, that it is multicultural and multiethnic,' she said. 'Whether or not you think it's good or bad, certainly it paints a different picture of what it means to be American and what the American calendar is.' A look at what days are marked as holidays in places around the country can be a crash course into what matters in those places. Louisiana, home to New Orleans, takes a day for Mardi Gras. In Hawaii, the state marks a day for King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian islands, as well as a day for becoming a U.S. state. California and some other states mark Cesar Chavez Day, named for the civil rights and labor movement activist. In Texas and in the southwest, there are celebrations scheduled for Friday marking Day of the Dead, the Mexican cultural remembrance of loved ones who have passed. The federal government, in addition to the 11 days that are days off for federal workers, has a host of days that it marks as national observances, like Harriet Tubman Day in March and Patriot Day on September 11. It keeps greeting card companies on their toes. 'Celebrating holidays and occasions, big or small, with the people we care about is a vital thread that runs through our shared human experience,' Kelly Ricker, chief product officer at American Greetings, said in a statement. The company is 'studying and talking to consumers, continuously' to keep up with the kinds of cards people are looking for. When Chris Sargiotto started his greeting card company Apartment 2 Cards about 15 years ago, the holiday offerings were limited to Christmas and Hanukkah. In recent years, he's added Kwanzaa and Ramadan, and is looking to bring Diwali cards onto the roster for next year. The additional holidays were added because of requests from his customers, the stores around that country that stock Apartment 2 cards, a reflection of increasing demand. 'It was stores asking for it because of their customers are asking for it,' he said. 'Whenever we introduce one of these specific cards, it seems to take off. So I think there definitely is the need for these.' There can be challenges as well But a holiday is not always uncontested. Take mid-October, when the federal government recognizes Columbus Day. It was added to the federal calendar in the 20th century after efforts from Italian Americans, who pushed for it as a way to stake their community's place in America. In the decades after though, Indigenous communities pushed back, citing the impact of colonization on their people and the continuing challenges. That has led to the spread of Indigenous People's Day marked on the same day, which while not a federally recognized is recognized in states around the country. And sometimes there's some learning that needs to happen as well. In Montville, New Jersey, the police department this month put a post on Facebook explaining to the community that with Diwali approaching, they would be more likely to see swastikas, a variation of which are ancient sacred symbols in some religions and not deployed in the way Hitler and the Nazis did. With both Jewish and Hindu communities in the town, it was done in an attempt to forestall misunderstanding, said Chief Andrew Caggiano, and has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response. 'It's a great opportunity,' he said, 'to raise awareness about other cultures that are that are in our community and that are part of our community at this point.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/america-s-holiday-calendar-is-increasingly-diverse/7848603.html	2024-11-03T01:41:06-08:00	
Ukrainian front-line school system goes underground to protect against bombs, radiation	ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine — To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child's life against the Russian weapons within striking distance. Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The NPP, as it's known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other. These twin dangers — bombs and radiation — shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022. So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system. Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system. The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children's grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn't hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike. 'Even classmates don't recognize each other,' she said. 'It's the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.' Nuclear shadow Within days of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia's 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes. Many residents left — though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk. By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle. The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine's grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency. 'Nuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It's not designed for that. It's also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,' said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine's Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country's rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an 'exclusion zone' off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe. Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there's not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn't reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends. An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 'They are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren't being targeted only at military targets,' Lair said. 'If I were in their position, I would be building them too.' In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid's absorption of some radiation. Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a 'critical threat to our sovereignty.' Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine's electricity. 'If, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won't respect state borders,' Zelenskyy said. Underground for the future The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous — the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army. 'Everybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it's priority No. 1,' said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. 'But if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?' Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she'll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates. 'It's safer than sitting at home remotely,' she said. School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine's military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens — but no basements. An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground. The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies. Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10. But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more — 'which is eliminating these weapons instead of … building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-front-line-school-system-goes-underground-to-protect-against-bombs-radiation/7847291.html	2024-11-03T01:40:29-08:00	
Inspired by Harris, Black sorority and fraternity members help downballot races	HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes isn't a member of the historically Black sororities and fraternities known as the 'Divine Nine.' But throughout her hotly contested reelection campaign this year, Hayes, the first Black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, has sometimes felt like she's a fellow soror, the term used by Black Greek organizations for sorority sisters. On their own, members have shown up to call voters, organize fundraisers, knock on doors, cheer Hayes on at campaign events and even offer pro bono legal help. 'I had people from Massachusetts come in to volunteer,' said Hayes, a Democrat who is seeking a fourth term. 'I've had people who had previously been considering going to a battleground state like Pennsylvania and are saying, 'No, we're going to stay right here and help out in this race in Connecticut.'' Downballot candidates like Hayes — particularly Black women — have benefited from a surge in support this year from volunteers who happen to be members of Black Greek organizations, many energized by Kamala Harris' presidential run. The vice president is a longtime member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at her alma matter, Howard University, in 1908. Harris pledged AKA as a senior at Howard in 1986. Collectively known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine historically Black sororities and fraternities are nonpartisan and barred from endorsing candidates because of their not-for-profit status. The organizations focus on voter registration drives, civic engagement and nonelectoral initiatives and are careful not to show favor to a particular candidate. But many of the groups' members, as individuals, have been 'extremely active' in federal and state races around the country this year, said Jaime R. Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 'I think that's a part of the Kamala Harris effect,' Harrison said during a recent visit to Connecticut. There were women affiliated with all the D9 sororities on a recent get-out-the-vote bus tour through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland to support Black women on the ballot. Along with other volunteers, they knocked on hundreds of doors, made thousands of calls and sent out hundreds of postcards, urging people to vote. The trip was organized by the Higher Heights for America PAC, a nearly 13-year-old organization that works to elect progressive Black women. Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. showed off their crimson and cream colors while stumping in Maryland for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, a fellow Delta who is in a closely watched race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Volunteers who are D9 sorority members also campaigned for Democratic U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha who is running for the U.S. Senate. If both candidates were elected, it would mark the first time two Black women have served in the Senate simultaneously. Latosha Johnson, a social worker from Hartford, recently participated in a get-out-the-vote phone banking session for Hayes along with other Black women who, like her, are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She said there's a realization among many Black and brown voters that the stakes in the election are particularly high. And if Harris wins, she'll need allies in Congress, Johnson said. 'If we don't get her a Congress that's going to be able to move things,' Johnson said, 'that becomes hard.' Hayes is in a rematch against former Republican George Logan, a former state senator who identifies as Afro-Latino but has not seen an outpouring of support from D9 members, according to his campaign. Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are courting Black voters in the final days of the presidential race. Harris' campaign has expressed concern about a lack of voting enthusiasm among Black men. While Trump's favorability among Black Americans has risen somewhat since he left office in 2021, two-thirds still identify as Democrats. About 2 in 10 identify as independents. About 1 in 10 identify as Republicans, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voter registration and nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts by the sororities and fraternities, coupled with the mobilization of individual members, could potentially have an impact on some of these races, said Darren Davis, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame. 'In local elections, in statewide elections, where the Black vote is more powerful and concentrated as opposed to in national elections, D9 organizations have this tremendous untapped ability to reach and to mobilize disaffected voters,' Davis said. The D9 fraternal groups were founded on U.S. college campuses in the early 1900s when Black students faced racial prejudice and exclusion that prevented them from joining existing white sororities and fraternities. In a tradition that continues today, the organizations focused on mutual upliftment, educational and personal achievement, civic engagement and a lifelong commitment to community service. Many of the fraternities and sororities served as training grounds for future civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. member Brandon McGee is a former Democratic state representative who now leads Connecticut's Social Equity Council on cannabis. As the father of two daughters, he is excited about helping Harris and Hayes win. 'I want my babies to see me working for a female who looks like their mother. And even beyond looking like their mother, a female,' he said. 'And I want my babies to know, 'You can do the same thing.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/inspired-by-harris-black-sorority-and-fraternity-members-help-downballot-races/7847208.html	2024-11-03T01:39:58-08:00	
Ballot box fires underscore concerns that conspiracy theories make them targets	atlanta, georgia — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in the city of Vancouver in the state of Washington. At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire suppression system contained the blaze and limited the number of ballots damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they try to identify who is responsible. Here's what happened, how rules and security measures about drop boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have undermined confidence in their use. What do we know? Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were connected and that they also are related to an October 8 incident when an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in Vancouver. Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in Portland to help them get replacements ballots. In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the Fisher's Landing Transit Center when the drop box's fire suppression system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a new one. The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur. Kimsey described the suspected arson as 'a direct attack on democracy.' When and where can drop boxes be used? Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered voters. They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded polling places or were worried about mail delays. In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Six others don't have a specific law but allow local communities to use them. Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they're located inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere, they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video surveillance or someone watching. Sporadic problems have occurred over the years. In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020. How should they be secured? The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient, high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and community centers. If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours, where they can be monitored. How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop boxes? Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years, targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020. A debunked film called '2,000 Mules' amplified the claims, exposing millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night. An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes in 2020. Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in various states. In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot, Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process. How have states responded since the 2020 election? Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the use of ballot drop boxes. Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting access. Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa, which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In Georgia's Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1 million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year's presidential election. That's down from 38 four years ago under an emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It's the result of an election overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election. Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not have a state law and do not use drop boxes. Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year's presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted away the city's lone drop box, an action that's under investigation by the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned and is in use.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ballot-box-fires-underscore-concerns-that-conspiracy-theories-make-them-targets/7845749.html	2024-11-03T01:39:26-08:00	
Liberty University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she's a transgender woman	The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender woman. The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on Liberty's Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this case a doctrinal statement asserting that 'denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender' is sinful. Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals. The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to 'set up' the university, applying for the IT job four months after beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in February 2023 — to adhere to the school's statement rejecting transgender transition. Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university of the gender transition process and then request that the school 'depart from its doctrine and mission,' Liberty Counsel said in an effort to get the lawsuit dismissed. 'All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an example out of the university for standing its ground,' contended Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel's founder and chairman. Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia's senior transgender rights attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up. 'It's strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real concern with employment discrimination,' they said. 'Her intention was to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all of her obligations.' The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the university Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the university — which she had admired — would accept her even after learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance review after completing her probation. 'I was really hoping they would work with me ... that I could be myself,' she told The Associated Press. 'I was hoping I could advocate for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.' In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition, Zinski stressed that her Christian faith 'has been a guiding force throughout this process.' 'The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,' she wrote. 'However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved.' Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what she described as intense anxiety. After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting. 'Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be incompatible with our Christian workplace,' the email said. What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit? Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small, private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes spiritual life on campus as 'inclusive and open.' 'A lot of people at work have my back,' Zinski said. She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg's Trinity Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first assured that 'God made me this way.' The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called 'ministerial exception' — which gives religious institutions protection against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial functions. Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, 'Liberty considers them to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right to make that call.' The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university's handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at least under its current leadership. 'My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who do not want me there at all,' she said. 'I would not feel comfortable enough to work there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/liberty-university-sued-by-former-it-staffer-fired-after-disclosing-she-s-a-transgender-woman/7845738.html	2024-11-03T01:38:37-08:00	
Latino evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around immigration	The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100 followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated come election season. Laguna's church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven closely watched swing states that could possibly decide the next president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical Christian community in the U.S. The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation, voting is 'not an intellectual issue.' 'It's a matter of faith and spirituality,' he said. 'We're in a complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion, and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around immigration and lack of reform. It's a difficult choice.' This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles — neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community leaders. A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals, they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44% identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left. While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in 2020, while four in 10 supported Biden. A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and criminal justice reform, he said. While many are offended by Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles added, Democrats still haven't figured out how to have conversations with the community about issues such as abortion. 'So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,' he said. 'That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a lot of discontent.' To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word 'evangelico' pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said. 'When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people create a new sense of community and family,' Conde-Frazier said. 'People are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this country.' With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities, second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church, she said. 'Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance, began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the U.S., moving away from their 'evangelico' roots,' Conde-Frazier said. Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration. Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews perceive it. 'Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not mean members are receiving it,' he said. 'They selectively take what they want from the teaching.' The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word 'evangelico' represents the Gospel to him. He says the 'evangelical' label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political party. 'Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,' he said. 'Some see their Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party is Christian in essence.' Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too. 'I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I'd like to belong to,' he said. 'The most important value we as Christians must live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing persecution.' Garcia said he has his 'opinions and inclinations' but doesn't view the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: 'If one is the anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.' The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more about the values a political party represents rather than the face or the voice of the party. 'Our community doesn't care about the politics,' she said. 'They care about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities, education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on family values. When they see the ballot, they don't see Trump or (Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is going to fare under a candidate.' The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more organically, she said. 'Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,' Tapia said. 'There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues. Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?' Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants are healthcare education, public safety and housing. 'Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities for marginalized communities,' he said. 'As pastors, we don't tell people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that best align with the values of the church and needs of our communities.' John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views. 'They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,' he said. Nevada is also a key swing state. Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is a top issue for his congregants. 'Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here already, they want the economy to be stable,' he said. 'They see homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.' Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he said. 'The struggle is real.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/latino-evangelical-voters-torn-between-their-faith-and-harsh-rhetoric-around-immigration/7845716.html	2024-11-03T01:37:51-08:00	
Indian Americans show shifting political loyalties ahead of presidential election	Washington — At a recent Diwali gathering in Denver, software architect Salil Gaonkar asked his Indian American friends to raise their hands: Would they vote for Trump or Harris in the presidential race? The response — from about 45 tech professionals and business owners who had overwhelmingly backed Joe Biden in 2020 — stunned him. Former President Donald Trump edged out Vice President Kamala Harris, albeit by a narrow margin. 'I was shocked,' Gaonkar, a progressive Democrat who is supporting Harris, said. 'Most of them voted for Biden, but now there was a significant shift and that surprised me really.' One dinner poll does not a trend make, but Gaonkar’s experience appears to reflect a broader national pattern. Indian Americans, long a reliable Democratic voting bloc, are showing signs of shifting allegiance. A Carnegie Endowment survey released this week showed the number of Indian Americans identifying as Democrats dropped to 47% from 56% in 2020. Harris, despite her Indian heritage, commanded just 60% support from a community that gave Biden nearly 70% of its votes four years ago. Trump, meanwhile, improved his support to 31% from 22%. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%. And while other polls show stronger South Asian support for Harris, the shift in loyalties is significant, said Milan Vaishnav, director of Carnegie Endowment’s South Asia program and one of the co-authors of the study. 'We are seeing some signs of a greater shift or movement or acceptance of at least this Republican Party, led by Trump, and that to us, was a big surprise,' Vaishnav said in an interview with VOA last Friday. The rightward drift isn’t unique to Indian Americans. In recent years, Republicans have made surprising gains among Hispanic, Black, Arab and Muslim voters – all once deemed reliable Democratic voting blocs. Polls show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump, and whether these shifts will propel the former president back to the White House remains uncertain. But the findings shatter a core assumption of American politics: that minority and immigrant communities are safely Democratic, Vaishnav said, during an online presentation Thursday. 'There has been this idea of demography is destiny and that the Democratic Party, which has been the natural home to ethnic and racial minorities and many if not most immigrant communities … will have a perpetual electoral advantage as the size of these groups increases,' he said. 'Clearly, there are many signs that that’s not true. Our survey is one of them.' More than 5 million strong, Indian Americans defy easy categorization. They’re predominantly Hindus, with smaller numbers of Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others among them. While many first-generation Indians lean conservative, plenty don’t. Ahead of the Tuesday’s election, their concerns mirror those of other Americans: Inflation, abortion, jobs, and immigration. U.S.-India relations barely register. 'They vote like Americans because they are,' said Sumitra Badrinathan, a professor at the American University and one of three co-authors of the report, during the presentation. Demolishing long-held assumptions about the community, the Carnegie survey revealed that Harris' Indian heritage hasn’t helped her top Biden's 2020 numbers. More surprisingly, it showed that Indian American men under 40 — not their first-generation, supposedly 'traditional' elders — are driving the rightward shift. 'The Democrats don't have a problem with the uncles,' Vaishnav said. 'They have a problem with males under 40.' According to Pew Research, about two-thirds of Indian Americans are immigrants. Many are politically split by era. 'People who came in 1990 or later are clinging to Trump, but people [in] my dad’s generation are solidly Democratic,' said Angana Shah, a Michigan-based social justice lobbyist and lawyer. The divide between first- and second-generation Indians surfaces in other ways. For many recent arrivals, illegal immigration has emerged as a top concern. Gaonkar said his formerly Biden-supporting friends cite illegal border crossings as the main reason for switching to Trump. 'Indians hate the illegal immigration that skyrocketed under Biden,' Gaonkar said. 'We know what hoops we have had to go through to get into the country legally and stay here and to see some others come in like that is not right.' The sentiment cuts deep among first-generation immigrants. Take Dharmendra Jaiswal, a Maryland tech executive whose path to citizenship stretched nearly 20 years. He voted for Biden in 2020, his first presidential election, but now backs Trump. 'People are pissed off,' he said. 'Illegal immigrants are getting [education and health care] from our taxpayer money.' Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. But Jaiswal said, 'illegal immigrant is illegal immigrant.' Suhag Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said the backlash against illegal immigration makes sense. Immigration backlogs force many Indian immigrants to wait 10 to 20 years for green cards and citizenship. 'People should not be in limbo for 20 years, but unfortunately that is the state of the immigration program that we are dealing with today and many are speaking out just like many other Americans about the need to have stronger borders,' Shukla said in an interview with VOA this week. Criticized for being soft on unauthorized immigration, Harris has defended her record, highlighting a drop in illegal border crossings due to recent policy changes implemented by the Biden administration. For his part, Trump has vowed to carry out the 'largest deportation operation in American history.' Harris’ campaign, launched in July, electrified many progressive Indian Americans, drawing thousands of eager volunteers. But the enthusiasm masked a deeper reality: Her Indian heritage proved a weak draw for many voters. The Carnegie survey found that fewer than 1 in 10 Indian American supporters were motivated by her South Asian heritage. Towson University professor Pallavi Guha, an Indian American, said many members of her community are 'looking beyond identity politics.' 'People who are supporting Vice President Harris are supporting Vice President Harris because of the policies,' Guha, who lives in Howard County, Virginia, said in an interview with VOA on Thursday. A survey of South Asian voters by the Indian American Impact Fund, a political group, found Harris leading Trump, 68% to 20%, in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. With more than 400,000 eligible South Asian voters in these states, the community is 'poised to make the margin of difference in what will likely be a razor-thin election,' the group said in a statement last month. But the enthusiasm isn’t uniform. Rupal Shah, an Atlanta-based second-generation Indian American non-profit worker volunteering for IAI, sees a generational divide. 'I’m second generation and I believe that my generation of folks are very, very pro-Kamala, ready to vote for her, excited about her,' Shah said. 'And then when you talk to my parents or parents in general, you get a sense of excitement and a sense of nervousness.' 'Their fiscal concerns always kind of rise to the top, but there's also a lot of excitement about Kamala and who she represents and how she represents our community,' Shah said. VOA reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response from either group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-americans-show-shifting-political-loyalties-ahead-of-presidential-election/7849306.html	2024-11-03T01:37:25-08:00	
Palestinians say Israel struck Gaza clinic during polio campaign; army denies it	CAIRO — Palestinian officials say an Israeli drone strike on a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio wounded six people, including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility. The alleged strike occurred Saturday in northern Gaza, which has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands. It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility. The World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency, known as UNICEF, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. 'The reports of this attack are even more disturbing as the Sheikh Radwan Clinic is one of the health points where parents can get their children vaccinated,' said Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF. 'Today's attack occurred while the humanitarian pause was still in effect, despite assurances given that the pause would be respected from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.' Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that 'contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.' A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from October 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said. The administration of the first dose was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including areas of northern Gaza that are now completely sealed off. Health officials said the campaign's first round, and the administration of the second dose across central and southern Gaza, were successful. At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N. The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but 'achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.' They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease. The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren't showing symptoms. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinians-say-israel-struck-gaza-clinic-during-polio-campaign-army-denies-it/7849358.html	2024-11-03T01:34:24-08:00	
Moldovan runoff election starts amid fraud and intimidation claims	CHISINAU, Moldova — Moldovans are casting votes in a decisive presidential runoff Sunday that pits pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu against a Russia-friendly opponent, as ongoing claims of voter fraud and intimidation threaten democracy in the European Union candidate country. In the first round held October 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general, who outperformed polls in the first round with almost 26% of the vote. Polling stations opened Sunday at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). A poll released by research company iData indicates a tight race that leans toward a narrow Sandu victory, an outcome that might rely on Moldova's large diaspora. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. Moldova's diaspora played a key role in a nationwide referendum also held on October 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova's path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday's vote have been overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova's judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Friday, Moldova's Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country were receiving 'anonymous death threats via phone calls' in what he called 'an extreme attack' to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. 'These acts of intimidation have only one purpose: to create panic and fear,' Recean said in a statement posted on social media. 'I assure you that state institutions will ensure order and protect citizens.' Outside a polling station on Sunday in Romania's capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a 'definitive step' toward Moldova's future. 'People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,' she said. 'Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.' In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anticorruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained 'conclusive evidence,' including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told the Associated Press that he's urged people to go and vote because it's a 'civic obligation' and that they do not name any candidates. 'We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,' he said. 'Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace.' On Thursday, prosecutors also raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told the AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it 'will not deflate' geopolitical tensions. 'On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections,' he said. Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to 'create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.' Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, says she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. 'We want a European future for our country,' she said, adding that it offers 'many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going ten steps back as a country.' A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year's vote could be Moscow's main target. In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp Westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. Since then, Moldovan authorities have repeatedly accused Russia of waging a vast 'hybrid war,' from sprawling disinformation campaigns to protests by pro-Russia parties to vote-buying schemes that undermine countrywide elections. Russia has denied it is meddling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovans-to-choose-president-in-decisive-runoff-overshadowed-by-fraud-and-intimidation-claims/7849351.html	2024-11-03T01:15:54-08:00	
Nevada lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its survival, lawsuit says	RENO, Nevada — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources. The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.'s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas. It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden's administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels. The new lawsuit says the Interior Department's approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S. wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm's buckwheat was 'in danger of extinction now' when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022. 'One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,' said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno. 'The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,' said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff. Rita Henderson, spokesperson for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment. Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and 'vigorously defend' approval of the project, 'which was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.' 'We are confident that the BLM will prevail,' Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year. The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than 1.6 kilometers away described as 'a site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.' But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 15-centimeter-tall wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig. The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 3.6 square kilometers the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival — would be lost for decades, some permanently. When proposing protection of the 368 hectares of critical habitat, the service said 'this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm's buckwheat.' The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status. 'We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm's buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,' the agency concluded. The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion. The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says. The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project 'will result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nevada-lithium-mine-will-crush-rare-plant-habitat-us-said-is-critical-to-its-survival-lawsuit-says-/7849321.html	2024-11-02T22:55:29-07:00	
UN talks on saving nature stumble on funding hurdle	Cali, Colombia — The world's biggest nature conservation conference closed in Colombia on Saturday with no agreement on a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection. With other successes under its belt, the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity was suspended by its president, Susana Muhamad, as negotiations ran almost 12 hours longer than planned and delegates started leaving to catch flights. The exodus left the summit without a quorum for decision-making, but CBD spokesman David Ainsworth told AFP it will resume at a later date to consider outstanding issues. 'We will continue working because this crisis is too big and we cannot stop,' Muhamad told AFP after declaring the Cali COP closed. The conference, the biggest meeting of its kind yet with about 23,000 registered delegates, was tasked with assessing, and ramping up, progress toward reaching 23 targets set in Canada two years ago to halt humankind's rapacious destruction of nature's bounty by 2030. They include placing 30% of land and sea areas under protection and 30% of degraded ecosystems under restoration by 2030, reducing pollution, and phasing out agricultural and other subsidies harmful to nature. For this purpose, it was agreed in 2022 that $200 billion per year be made available to protect biodiversity by 2030, including the transfer of $30 billion per year from rich to poor nations. The total for 2022 was about $15 billion, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. On top of that, nations have pledged about $400 million to a Global Biodiversity Framework Fund created last year to meet the U.N. targets. In Cali, negotiators were split largely between poor and rich country blocs as they haggled over increased funding and other commitments. The biggest ask from the summit — to lay out a detailed funding plan — turned out to be a bridge too far. Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister, had offered a draft text proposing the creation of a dedicated biodiversity fund, which was rejected by the European Union, Switzerland and Japan. Developing nations had insisted on the creation of a new fund, saying they are not adequately represented in existing mechanisms including the GBFF, which they say are also too onerous. The lack of agreement is 'a negative signal that will have repercussions on the other environmental negotiations at the end of the year because it reveals a deep disagreement on the technical possibility of making transfers between the Global North and South,' said Sebastien Treyer, of the French think tank Iddri. The meeting did manage to coalesce around the creation of a fund to share the profits of digitally sequenced genetic data taken from plants and animals with the communities they come from. Such data, much of it from species found in poor countries, is notably used in medicines and cosmetics that can make their developers billions, very little of which ever trickles back down. The Cali agreement determines that genetic data users whose income exceeds a certain threshold should contribute 1% of profits or 0.1% of revenue to the new fund, potentially worth billions of dollars per year. Delegates also approved the creation of a permanent body to represent the interests of Indigenous people under the U.N.'s Convention on Biological Diversity. Representatives of Indigenous peoples, many in traditional dress and headgear, broke out in cheers and chants as the agreement was gaveled through. But the talks on biodiversity funding stumbled even as new research presented to coincide with COP16 showed that more than a quarter of assessed plants and animals are now at risk of extinction. Only 17.6% of land and inland waters, and 8.4% of the ocean and coastal areas, are estimated to be protected and conserved. Observers welcomed the summit's advances on Indigenous representation and gene profit sharing but lamented the funding deadlock. 'Governments in Cali put forward plans to protect nature but were unable to mobilize the money to actually do it,' said An Lambrechts, the head of Greenpeace's COP16 delegation. 'Biodiversity finance remains stalled after a deafening absence of credible finance pledges from wealthy governments and unprecedented corporate lobbying.' The meeting was held amid a massive security deployment following threats from a Colombian guerrilla group with its base of operations near Cali. No incidents were reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-talks-on-saving-nature-stumble-on-funding-hurdle/7849302.html	2024-11-02T19:24:54-07:00	
Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes	CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved ones. This year, the annual 'Hugs Not Walls' event organized by an immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S. presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily on immigration and border security. It also took place under decreased security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of Migrants. 'We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers deployed in our community,' said Fernando Garcia, the organization's director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has seen since the reunions began last decade. 'The barbed wire had to be opened so that the families could have this event.' Garcia said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless of who wins Tuesday's election. Family reunions, he said, will continue, too. 'Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these families,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/families-separated-by-us-mexico-border-reunite-for-a-few-precious-minutes/7849296.html	2024-11-02T19:05:41-07:00

Email the VOA immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com. By immigrants, for immigrants: 'Documented' covers immigration through a personal lens In New York City, a media outlet run by immigrants for immigrants uses messaging apps to engage with communities on elections, crime and local issues. Liam Scott and Cristina Caicedo Smit have the story, narrated by Caicedo Smit. Tina Trinh contributed. Naturalized citizens to play a bigger role in 2024 election Naturalized immigrants will make up 10% of Americans eligible to vote in 2024. What impact might they have on the election? US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum restrictions U.S. border authorities apprehended about 54,000 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary figures obtained by Reuters. They show a marginal rise from September but continue the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate Donald Trump over illegal immigration. Reuters reports. Migrant families separated under Trump still feel fallout, fear his return With the United States on the verge of an election that could put former President Donald Trump back in office, Billy wants people to know that what happened to him and several thousand other children still reverberates. Some families have not been reunited, and many of those together in the U.S. have temporary status and fear a victorious Trump carrying out promised mass deportations. The Associated Press reports.

Canada-India tensions could escalate cyberthreats, hinder immigration Canada's deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary national security committee Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the mastermind behind the alleged plots. Reported by Reuters. Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual violence escalates The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening 'regional instability.' 'The scale of this displacement and the corresponding humanitarian needs grows every day,' Amy Pope, IOM director general, told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan.

Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of obstructing prisoner swaps	MOSCOW — Kyiv called on Moscow on Sunday to provide a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war ready for a swap after Russia accused Ukraine of sabotaging the exchange process. In requesting the list of Ukrainians from his Russian counterpart, Ukrainian human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets wrote on his Telegram messaging channel: 'We are always ready to exchange prisoners of war!' Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor in 2022. The last swap took place in mid-October with each side bringing home 95 prisoners. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Ukraine was essentially sabotaging the process and has refused to take back its own citizens. Zakharova said Russia's defense ministry had offered to hand over 935 Ukrainian prisoners of war, but that Ukraine had taken only 279. Lubinets, in turn, said that Ukraine was always ready to accept its citizens and accused Russia of slowing the exchange process. Russian Commissioner for Human Rights Tatyana Moskalkova said on Saturday that Ukraine has politicized the issue. 'We consider it necessary to return to a constructive dialog and speed up the exchange of prisoners,' Moskalkova wrote on Telegram.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-accuse-each-other-of-obstructing-prisoner-swaps-/7849284.html	2024-11-02T17:47:28-07:00	
B-52 bombers arrive in Middle East, US military says	Washington — American B-52 bombers have arrived in the Middle East, the U.S. military said Saturday, a day after Washington announced their deployment in a warning to Iran. 'B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers from Minot Air Force Base's 5th Bomb Wing arrived in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility,' the military command for the Middle East and surrounding countries said in a post on social media. The United States announced Friday evening that it was sending the bombers, fighter and tanker aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the Middle East. 'Should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,' Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said in a statement on the deployment. Israel launched strikes against Iran on October 26, hitting military infrastructure while steering clear of critical nuclear and oil sites, and the country's supreme leader has vowed that Tehran will retaliate for Israeli attacks. Iran has carried out two major attacks against Israel in 2024, one in April after a strike on its consulate in Damascus that was blamed on Israel, and another in October that Tehran said was in response to the assassination of leaders of armed groups it backs in the Middle East.	https://www.voanews.com/a/b-52-bombers-arrive-in-middle-east-us-military-says/7849285.html	2024-11-02T17:44:29-07:00	
North Korean 'white paper' says South Korea's president raised risk of nuclear war	seoul — North Korean state media released a white paper Sunday accusing South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol of exposing his country to the danger of nuclear war through his policies toward the North. The document, compiled by North Korea's Institute of Enemy State Studies and released by state news agency KCNA, criticized Yoon's 'reckless remarks' about war, abandoning elements of an inter-Korean agreement, engaging in nuclear war planning with the United States, and seeking closer ties with Japan and NATO. 'It's ever-worsening military moves resulted only in the paradoxical consequences of pushing [North Korea] to stockpile its nuclear weapons at an exponential rate and further develop its nuclear attack capability,' the paper said. Yoon, a conservative, has taken a hard line on North Korea, which has forged ahead with developing its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions. His administration blames North Korea for raising tensions with weapons tests and providing military aid and troops to aid Russia's war in Ukraine. Pyongyang has been taking steps to sever inter-Korean ties, redefining the South as a separate, hostile enemy state since Kim Jong Un declared it a 'primary foe' early this year and said unification was no longer possible. North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas last month, and satellite imagery shows it has since built large trenches across the former crossings. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The two Koreas also have clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South. Sunday's white paper also listed Yoon's domestic political woes, including scandals involving his wife, which have driven his approval ratings to record lows.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-white-paper-says-south-korea-s-president-raised-risk-of-nuclear-war-/7849275.html	2024-11-02T17:22:00-07:00	
Supporters of Bolivia's ex-leader Morales detain 200 soldiers: government	La Paz, Bolivia — Supporters of former Bolivian president Evo Morales are holding at least 200 soldiers hostage, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday, as their standoff with the state continues to escalate. Three military units in Chapare province were 'assaulted by irregular groups' Friday, with the assailants 'taking more than 200 military personnel hostage' from three barracks, the ministry said. 'They seized weapons and ammunition,' it added. Backers of Morales, the country's first Indigenous leader, began blocking roads three weeks ago to prevent his arrest on what he calls trumped-up charges aimed at thwarting his political comeback. The government had sent troops to the area in Cochabamba department to help police in clearing the roadblocks. Early reports Friday had mentioned only 20 soldiers being detained. A video broadcast Friday showed 16 soldiers surrounded by protesters holding pointed sticks. 'They have cut off our water, electricity and are keeping us hostage,' a uniformed man is heard saying. Morales, after first threatening a hunger strike unless the government agreed to negotiations, later urged his supporters to consider suspending the roadblocks to 'avoid bloodshed.' Morales, 65, was in office from 2006 to 2019, when he resigned under a cloud after elections marked by fraud. Despite being barred from running again, Morales wants to challenge President Luis Arce, his former ally, for the nomination of the left-wing MAS party in elections next August. Days after he led a march of thousands of mainly Indigenous Bolivians on the capital La Paz to protest Arce's policies, prosecutors announced Morales was under investigation for statutory rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged relationship with a 15-year-old girl in 2015. Morales has called the accusations 'a lie.' On Wednesday, Arce demanded an 'immediate' end to the roadblocks, saying the government would 'exercise its constitutional powers to safeguard the interests of the Bolivian people.' It was in Chapare that Morales claimed last week he was the victim of an assassination attempt that he blamed on state agents. A video he shared on social media showed his pickup truck riddled with bullet holes. The government said police fired on the vehicle after Morales's convoy first opened fire at a checkpoint. Morales' supporters initially demanded an end to what they called his 'judicial persecution.' But the protest movement has snowballed into a wider antigovernment revolt marked by calls for Arce to resign. They blame Arce, who has been in power since November 2020, for a sharp rise in food and fuel prices and shortages that pre-date the protests. At least 90 people, mostly officers, have been injured in clashes surrounding the protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-of-bolivia-s-ex-leader-morales-detain-200-soldiers-government/7849278.html	2024-11-02T17:18:55-07:00	
Protesters demonstrate in Tel Aviv to demand end of war, return of hostages	Tel Aviv, Israel — Hundreds of protesters in Tel Aviv, Israel, voiced their frustration with the government Saturday for failing to secure a truce to bring the remaining hostages in Gaza home. Flag-waving demonstrators in the country's commercial hub held placards with slogans including 'Deal now,' 'Stop the war' and 'We won't abandon them,' and beat drums and chanted 'Why are they still in Gaza?' 'There have been countless opportunities to end this crisis, and each one was torpedoed by the government,' said demonstrator Zahiro Shahar Mor, a 52-year-old bank employee from Tel Aviv. 'The cycle of violence is escalating week after week and we see no end,' said Mor, whose uncle Avraham Munder was killed in captivity in Gaza, and who is campaigning for the release of others' loved ones. Critics have questioned why a truce has still not materialized now that Israel has achieved many of its war aims, including last month's killing of Hamas's leader Yahya Sinwar. Israeli and U.S. officials as well as some analysts have said Sinwar was an obstacle to reaching a truce in the war between Israel and Hamas. Ifat Kalderon, a prominent antigovernment protester afraid for her cousin still held in Gaza, blamed Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister. 'Each hostage deal they start to talk about, he sabotages. He always blamed Sinwar, but now there is no Sinwar. But every time he finds another reason,' the 50-year-old stylist told AFP. 'It's a bloody war, we need to stop it. Enough. So many soldiers are dying. And ordinary citizens,' she said, referring to civilians from both sides of the conflict paying with their lives. Some at the rally — organized by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group — brought up the plight of Israel's soldiers, who are exhausted more than a year into the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Others hoped for international intervention, including from the United States, which holds a presidential election Tuesday. 'I hope whoever wins will be adult enough to take the kids in the Middle East by the ear and force them to the negotiating table,' said protester Mor. He said he was 'disappointed, frustrated and angry' at the lack of a hostage deal but was 'keeping the hope for the people who are still alive' in Gaza. Sinwar's killing had spurred hope that fresh life could be breathed into months of fruitless negotiations for a truce with hostage and prisoner releases. The talks have been mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stop-the-war-say-israelis-demanding-return-of-gaza-hostages-/7849068.html	2024-11-02T16:49:29-07:00	
Time to 'fall back' an hour as daylight saving time ends	The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad: It'll be dark by late afternoon for the next few months in the United States. Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time Sunday, which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed. Standard time will last until March 9, when we will again 'spring forward' with the return of daylight saving time. 'Fall back' should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the dark or trying to exercise while there's still enough light. Some people with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle, too. Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with the sun — and human biology. Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don't change and stay on standard time. Here's what to know about the twice-yearly ritual. How the body reacts to light The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we're more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens. Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync. How do time changes affect sleep? Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules — because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay the same. That's a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don't get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. How to prepare for the time change Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their bedtimes little by little in the days before the change. There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep.	https://www.voanews.com/a/time-to-fall-back-an-hour-as-daylight-saving-time-ends-/7849055.html	2024-11-02T15:25:35-07:00	
VOA Interview: UN special rapporteur details Russia's state-sanctioned torture	washington — Mariana Katzarova, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Russia, reported Tuesday on the human rights situation in Russia at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, describing torture as Moscow's main tool of repression. In an interview with VOA, Katzarova detailed how the Russian government has turned brutality into the new norm and how Russians are persecuted for their anti-war views. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: You came to Washington with a new report about torture in Russia. The torture system is not something new. Did it get worse during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine? U.N. Special Rapporteur on Russia Mariana Katzarova: The main message of this report was about the state-sanctioned system of torture being a tool used in a widespread and systematic manner by the authorities for oppression and control of Russian society. Yes, it did get worse. First of all, because it's a tool in the war against Ukraine. For example, we don't even know how many. Still, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been detained in the occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian forces and then deported to Russia proper in Russian prisons. They're kept incommunicado. They have been tortured, including with electric shocks, with sexual violence, rape against them. Many of them haven't even been charged with any criminal offenses; they're just kept there kidnapped. I've seen pictures of some of them who have been tried in Rostov-on-Don in military courts. I mean, they look like [they're] coming from concentration camps. Also, after the terrorist attack in March in Moscow, it was kind of, you know, a new page was turned where the authorities almost legitimized torture, normalized it, almost encouraged it to be happening because they allowed it on the national television to show torture of the suspects, Tajik migrants. As it happened, the suspects in the Crocus [City Hall] attack, terrorist attack, [were subjected to beatings and torture] including the electric shock to the genitals of one of the suspects or [the] cutting of the ear. There was another transmission on television. These people were [nearly] dead and were brought in front of a judge, and the judge completely pretended that nothing was happening. VOA: Are you expecting any reaction from Russian officials regarding that report? Katzarova: I, of course, as a special rapporteur of the U.N. system, I hope that the Russian Federation will pay attention because governments around the world are in charge of protecting the rights of their citizens. If the Russian authorities are not interested in the protection of the human rights of their own people, this is shocking. I mean, that's why I'm hoping that they're not going to turn a blind eye, particularly when we're talking about torture, which is entirely outlawed by international law under all circumstances. VOA: You said you would like to have some constructive dialogue with the Russian officials. Is that possible? Katzarova: All special rapporteurs of the U.N. are independent experts the governments appoint, members of the U.N., to advise and present the truth about the human rights situation in these countries. Of course, in normal circumstances, I should have had a constructive dialogue with the Russian authorities. So far, it's been one way. It's a monologue. I'm presenting my report. They're reading it, but they're not answering. All I can say is that I am planning to send them my new letters. I do it every year after my mandate is voted on by the governments of the Human Rights Council. They're not allowing me to visit Russia to meet with all the Russian people, victims of human rights violations, lawyers, the government authorities, the ombudsperson for human rights. This is what we should be doing as special rapporteurs. VOA: What kind of role can the U.N. play in helping the victims? Katzarova: First of all, this report is shedding light on the continuing almost full, complete impunity for torturing ill-treatment. Various people of various targeted groups, starting with [the ones] I just mentioned, the Ukrainian detained civilians and POWs, but also from the Russian society. These are the LGBT persons who are pronounced as extremist organizations by the Supreme Court of Russia. These are the mobilized conscientious objectors and the mobilized men who refuse to fight and who are tortured as well, subjected to torture, to ... convince them to continue fighting or join the war against Ukraine. And, of course, now another targeted group where the political prisoners, they're being subjected to torture as conditions of detention. They're also a target for the authorities, of course, to begin with. Alexey Navalny spent something like 394 and 96 days in SHIZO, which is a special punishment cell. Also, anti-war activists have been subjected in administrative detention to something called Carrousel. They're kept for two weeks, then another two weeks until criminal cases are fabricated against them. And we know of deaths in custody of such activists under torture. VOA: If some Russian officials, let's say, Sergey Lavrov, would listen to us right now, what would you say? Katzarova: I would say, 'Dear Mr. Lavrov, Your Excellency, please respect your own laws and most importantly, the international law and the rules of the United Nations. All the conventions that you have signed and ratified. And please respect the human rights of the Russian people. They're your people, and they deserve better than languishing in prisons. They deserve better than being herded, and then sent to fight in the war, which is not their war. So, please respect human rights and show the United Nations that you deserve to be a member of the Security Council and a beacon, a country to show the way for other countries that need to follow in your steps because you're one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. And please stop the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people and the Russian people suffered enough because of this aggressive war. What else can we do apart from shed light? Speak up, not be afraid, and wait for our messages and the truth to be heard. As we say in Bulgaria and other countries, the darkest time is before sunrise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-un-special-rapporteur-details-russia-s-state-sanctioned-torture-/7849048.html	2024-11-02T15:07:58-07:00	
Agreement signed at UN summit gives Indigenous groups voice	CALI, Colombia — After two weeks of negotiations, delegates on Saturday agreed at the United Nations conference on biodiversity to establish a subsidiary body that will include Indigenous peoples in future decisions on nature conservation, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize the role of the descendants of some regions' original inhabitants in protecting land and combating climate change. The delegates also agreed to oblige major corporations to share the financial benefits of research when using natural genetic resources. Indigenous delegations erupted into cheers and tears after the historic decision to create the subsidiary body was announced. It recognizes and protects the traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples and local communities for the benefit of global and national biodiversity management, said Sushil Raj, Executive Director of the Rights and Communities Global Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society. 'It strengthens representation, coordination, inclusive decision making, and creates a space for dialogue with parties to the COP,' Raj told The Associated Press, also known as the Conference of Parties. Negotiators had struggled to find common ground on some key issues in the final week but came to a consensus after talks went late into Friday. 'Historical debt' The COP16 summit, hosted in Cali, Colombia, was a follow-up to the historic 2022 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures to save Earth's plant and animal life, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. A measure to recognize the importance of the role of people of African descent in the protection of nature was also adopted in Cali. The Indigenous body will be formed by two co-chairs elected by COP: one nominated by U.N. parties of the regional group, and the other nominated by representatives of Indigenous peoples and local communities, the AP saw in the final document. At least one of the co-chairs will be selected from a developing country, taking into account gender balance, the document said. 'With this decision, the value of the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities is recognized, and a 26-year-old historical debt in the Convention on Biological Diversity [CBD] is settled,' Susana Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister and COP16 president, posted on social media platform X shortly after the announcement. Who owns nature's DNA was one of the most contentious and fiercely negotiated topics at the summit as tensions spiked between poorer and developed countries over digital sequence information on genetic resources, or DSI. Negotiators consented on Saturday morning, however, to bind big companies to share benefits when using resources from animals, plants or microorganisms in biotechnologies. Delegations agreed on a genetic information fee of 0.1% of companies' revenues from products derived from such information. 'Many of the life-saving medicines we use today come from the rainforest. It is therefore right that a portion of the income companies generate from this information goes back to protect nature,' said Toerris Jaeger, executive director of Rainforest Foundation Norway. 'This is the absolute highlight from COP16.' Needs exceed pledges Also adopted was an agreement to protect human health from Earth's increasing biodiversity issues. Ecosystem degradation and loss of ecological integrity directly threaten human and animal health, environmental groups say. Pledges made by countries during the two weeks were far short of the billions needed to tackle plummeting global biodiversity, with only around $400 million in the fund. The modest pledges don't bode well for the next U.N. climate talks, COP29, to take place in Azerbaijan beginning later this month. COP29 is expected to focus on how to generate trillions of dollars needed for the world to transition to clean energies such as solar, wind and geothermal. Raising that money will require major commitments by nations, companies and philanthropies. In Montreal's biodiversity summit, wealthy nations pledged to raise $20 billion in annual conservation financing for developing nations by 2025, with that number rising to $30 billion annually by 2030. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/agreement-signed-at-un-summit-gives-indigenous-groups-voice-/7849034.html	2024-11-02T14:11:47-07:00	
Mexicans celebrate Day of Dead, grapple with keeping tradition	MEXICO CITY — Every year this time Mexico erupts in celebrations during the Day of the Dead. Families gather at cemeteries across the country on November 1 to reconnect with their dead just as their ancestors have done for centuries. For many more in small communities, it's also about preserving the core of their traditions as celebrations in places in bigger hubs have increasingly been marked by mass tourism. 'We're conserving our tradition, part of our heritage that my mother instilled in me,' said 58-year-old Antonio Melendez. 'We can't let it be lost.' Observance dates back centuries Melendez was among throngs of people gathered in the cemetery, tucked away in the maze of canals and brick buildings in Xochimilco, a borough in south of Mexico City that has long carried on traditions that have faded away in other parts of the country. He gathered with his two daughters around the grave of his mother, marked by orange flower petals spread out in the shape of a cross and bouquets of pink flowers, his mother's favorite color. Melendez said she died last year, and the loss was still fresh, so he was trying to remember her by continuing with the same rituals he watched her carry out growing up, this time with his daughters. He started preparing for the celebration four days before, making tamales from scratch and building a small altar for her in their home. Day of the Dead dates back centuries to ancient Indigenous civilizations, which would organize parties when someone died to guide them on to the next life, and lay out food in altars to nourish them on their journeys. When Spanish colonizers arrived and began forcing Catholicism upon Indigenous communities, they would mix Indigenous traditions with Catholic holidays. Celebrations of the dead then synced up with All Saints Day on November 1, ending on November 2. While celebrations begin ramping up at the end of October, Mexican tradition says that on that night their deceased are closest to the living world, and people hope to keep them company. Each family celebrates in different ways. In San Gregorio Pantheon, elderly women carry massive bundles of orange flowers, the iconic flower of death. Some families sob into each other's arms. Others sit alone next to loved one's graves in silence. Many more drink mezcal and tell stories of their family members. 'It's like being with them' Gathered with her daughter and granddaughter, 60-year-old Beatriz Chavez kneels at the graves of her son, nephew and father, quietly lighting candles. 'It's like being with them one more year, feeling like even if they don't see them, we feel like we're closer to them,' Chavez said, noting that she planned to sleep in the graveyard, just like she did every year since her father died when she was 10. Over the years, the tradition has been the focus of the Disney film Coco. A Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City was also featured in a James Bond film, despite such a parade not existing in real life. Annual celebrations later adopted the idea of the parade from the movie. Now, people from all over the world have flocked to the Latin American nation, eager to experience the rich tradition for themselves. But once quaint celebrations in hubs for the Day of the Dead like Mexico City, Oaxaca and Michoacan have started to brim with tourists, who snap photos of mourners. In recent years, many Mexicans have also started to mix the celebration with Halloween. Other new traditions — such as the James Bond parade — have popped up. Some, like Melendez, prickle at the shifts. 'Here, Halloween isn't ours, it's Day of the Dead,' he said. 'It's sad because it's getting distorted. We're losing the essence of who we are. This is a part of us, our roots.' For Melendez, it adds an extra level of importance to the celebration in their small cemetery, which he and others say has stayed true to the centuries-old traditions. It coincides with a larger conversation playing out across Mexico amid an influx of American 'expats' and tourists. As more move to or travel to Mexico City, rents have gotten so high that many Mexicans have been pushed out of areas they've lived in for much of their lives, leaving frustration simmering in much of the city. Those who wander the graves and sell flowers and food in the streets see the changes less as a loss of tradition, and more as an evolution — a way for younger generations to continue passing on their heritage in their own ways, and share it with new audiences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexicans-celebrate-day-of-dead-grapple-with-keeping-tradition-/7849024.html	2024-11-02T13:29:47-07:00	
Israel captures senior Hezbollah operative in Lebanon, military says	BATROUN, Lebanon — Israeli naval forces captured a senior Hezbollah operative in north Lebanon, an Israeli military official said Saturday. Earlier on Saturday, Lebanese authorities said they were investigating whether Israel was behind the capture of a Lebanese sea captain who was taken away by a group of armed men who had landed on the coast near the northern town of Batroun on Friday. 'The operative has been transferred to Israeli territory and is currently being investigated,' the military official said, without providing the name of the person in detention. Two Lebanese military officials confirmed to the Associated Press that a naval force landed in Batroun, about 30 kilometers north of Beirut, and abducted a Lebanese citizen. Neither gave the man's identity or said whether he was thought to have links to Lebanon's Hezbollah group. They did not confirm whether the armed men were an Israeli force. Speaking to Lebanon's Al-Jadeed TV, Ali Hamie, Lebanon's minister of Public Works and Transport, declined to go into details or answer questions about whether it was thought to be an Israeli operation. Three Lebanese judicial officials told AP the incident occurred at dawn Friday, adding that the captain might have links with Hezbollah. The officials said an investigation is looking into the man to determine if he is linked to Hezbollah or working for an Israeli spy agency and an Israeli force came to rescue him. Both the military and judicial officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were unauthorized to share details about the incident or the ongoing investigation. Hezbollah issued a statement calling what happened a 'Zionist aggression in the Batroun area.' The statement did not give details or confirm whether one of Hezbollah's members was captured by Israel. Israel has carried out commando operations deep inside Lebanon to kidnap or kill Hezbollah and Palestinian officials. Residents of the apartment building where the man was seized said the armed group introduced themselves as state security. 'We were terrified. They were breaking into the apartment next to ours,' Hussein Delbani told The Associated Press near where the man was captured. 'I thought a state agency was doing a security operation,' said Delbani, who was displaced from south Lebanon a month ago when the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted. He said he saw from his balcony people down on the coast and they ordered him to go inside. Hamie told Al-Jadeed the man was a captain of civilian ships. He graduated in 2022 and in late September joined the Batroun's Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute for additional courses. Hamie said that the man lived some 300 meters from the institute. Hamie's remarks came shortly after two Lebanese journalists posted a video on social media showing what appeared to be about 20 armed men taking away a man from in front a house, his face covered with his shirt. Kandice Ardiel, a spokesperson for the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed in south Lebanon, denied allegations by some journalists who said the peacekeepers helped the landing force in the operation. The U.N. mission, known as UNIFIL, has a maritime force that monitors the coast. 'Disinformation and false rumors are irresponsible and put peacekeepers at risk,' Ardiel said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-captures-senior-hezbollah-operative-in-lebanon-military-says-/7849012.html	2024-11-02T12:35:14-07:00	
Iran arrests female student who stripped to protest harassment	Paris — Iranian authorities arrested a female student Saturday after she staged a solo protest against harassment by stripping to her underwear outside her university, reports said. The woman, who has not been identified, had been harassed inside the prestigious Tehran Azad University of Science and Research by members of the Basij militia who ripped her headscarf and clothes, according to reports by several news outlets and social media channels outside Iran. She then took off her clothes in protest and sat outside the university dressed just in her underwear before defiantly walking in the street to the astonishment of passers-by, videos posted on social media channels showed. Under the dress code mandatory in Iran, women must wear a headscarf in public and loose-fitting clothes that cover all bodily contours. The footage, which was first posted by Iranian student social media channel, the Amir Kabir newsletter, was published by numerous Persian-language outlets, including the Dadban legal affairs social media channel, the Hengaw rights group and Iran Wire news website. The footage appeared to have been shot by onlookers in a neighboring building. Another video showed her being bundled into a car by men in plain clothes and driven off to an undisclosed location. The Amir Kabir newsletter alleged she was beaten during the arrest. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports, but Iran's conservative Fars news agency confirmed the incident in a report, publishing a picture with the student heavily blurred out. It said the student had worn 'inappropriate clothes' in class and 'stripped' after being warned by security guards to comply with the dress code. Citing 'witnesses,' it insisted that the security guards spoke 'calmly' with the student and denied the reports that their action had been aggressive. Unprecedented women-led protests erupted in 2022 demanding the abolition of the mandatory dress code following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman who had been arrested for an alleged breach. The protests, which saw women break taboos by removing their headscarves and on occasion even burning them, subsided in the face of a crackdown that left 551 protesters dead and thousands arrested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-arrests-female-student-who-stripped-to-protest-harassment-/7849000.html	2024-11-02T12:02:39-07:00

Indian troops kill 3 suspected rebels in disputed Kashmir	SRINAGAR, INDIA — Three suspected militants were killed Saturday in separate gunbattles in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Saturday. India’s military in a statement said soldiers intercepted a group of militants in a forested area in southern Anantnag district Saturday, leading to a gunbattle that killed two rebels. In a separate incident in the disputed region’s main city of Srinagar, police and paramilitary soldiers killed a militant in an exchange of gunfire after troops cordoned off a neighborhood on a tip that he was hiding in a house. Police said two soldiers and two police were injured in the fighting. Residents said the troops torched the home where the rebel was trapped, a common tactic employed by Indian troops in the Himalayan region. There was no independent confirmation of the incident. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. The nuclear-armed rivals have fought two of their three wars over the territory since they gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-troops-kill-3-suspected-rebels-in-disputed-kashmir/7848957.html	2024-11-02T10:22:27-07:00

Clashes in Mozambique as police disperse election protests	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas and rubber bullets Saturday as they dispersed protests in several cities over a disputed presidential election, according to local sources and AFP reporters. Unrest has rocked the southern African nation since an October 9 election, which was won by the ruling Frelimo party, in power since 1975, but denounced as fraudulent by opposition parties. Election observers, including some from the European Union, have noted irregularities and denounced violence before, during and after the vote. The leading opposition candidate, Venancio Mondlane, has called for nationwide protests until November 7, with a final rally planned in Maputo. On Saturday, hundreds of people who had gathered to protest the election results in Maputo were dispersed by police with tear gas and rubber bullets, according to AFP reporters on the scene. Police were seen patrolling the city Saturday to try to dissuade residents from other parts of the country from coming to next week's protest. In the northern province of Nampula, almost 2,000 kilometers (more than 1,200 miles) from the capital, clashes broke out in several areas Saturday between protesters and police, a witness and a local group told AFP. In the city of Nampula, 'at approximately 9 a.m. almost 500 people took to the street on Trabalho Avenue to contest election results,' said Constantino Jose, a taxi driver in the city. 'Protesters also gathered in Arresta [the largest market in Nampula] and blocked some roads,' said Jose. 'Police shot tear gas and real bullets to disperse the crowd,' he said, without giving further details. A local civil society group, Plataforma Decide, told AFP that 'Nampula province is in chaos' and that 'in Nampula City ... the police fired tear gas.' Police did not respond to AFP's request for comment on the reports. In the town of Namialo, some 95 kilometers (60 miles) from Nampula, 'over 100 demonstrators burnt tires on the street,' a local journalist said, adding that 'a strong police contingent' had been deployed to the area. He asked to remain anonymous as he feared for his safety. Another source said that at least nine people had been shot, but it wasn't immediately clear if it was by tear gas or bullets. A local official, Melchior Focas, an administrator in Meconta-Namialo, confirmed to AFP there had been 'clashes' in the area. Mozambique has imposed internet restrictions since post-electoral violence broke out, including blocking access to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Mondlane has widely used social media platforms to communicate with his supporters and rally them to protest. The spiral of unrest started shortly after the election, turning violent on October 24 when the electoral commission declared Frelimo's Daniel Chapo, 47, winner with almost 71% of votes. Mondlane, 50, of the small Podemos party, came in second with 20% but said the results were 'false.' Police have said that 20 people have been injured in post-electoral violence and that two people have died, without giving details. An investigation was opened into Mondlane following the unrest and his calls for '25 days of terror.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-in-mozambique-as-police-disperse-election-protests/7848911.html	2024-11-02T09:23:56-07:00	
Greek anti-terror police arrest man after deadly Athens blast	ATHENS, GREECE — Greek anti-terror investigators have arrested a man in connection with a deadly explosion in Athens, police said Saturday, warning of 'a new generation of terrorists' at work. Thursday's blast in an apartment in the capital, which killed a man and seriously injured a woman, is suspected to have been caused by the accidental detonation of a homemade bomb. Police sources told AFP they had identified the dead man from his dismembered remains as a 36-year-old from the port city of Piraeus who had been previously arrested in Germany. His fingerprints were in the international database of Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, the sources said. Investigators have also opened a case for alleged participation in a terrorist organization and committing terrorist acts against the injured woman, 33, who was hospitalized under police supervision, and a 30-year-old woman who remains at large. In their statement, police said Saturday that the arrested man was detained after turning himself in Friday. He is believed to have a connection with one of the two women wanted in the case but has denied having anything to do with the explosion, police said. Police said that a search of the apartment produced two handguns, wigs and face masks among other materials. Greek police sources told AFP that investigations were ongoing and that the deceased and those charged were probably members of 'a new generation of terrorists.' The country has a decades-old history of far-left extremism involving small urban groups. The shadow November 17 group, named after an anti-junta student uprising, was behind the 1975 killing of the CIA’s Athens station Chief Richard Welch and claimed responsibility for assassinating 23 people in scores of attacks on U.S., British, Turkish and Greek targets between the 1970s and 1990s. In the past decade, scores of arson and bomb attacks in Greece have hit financial, diplomatic and political targets, with police blaming radical anarchists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-anti-terror-police-arrest-man-after-deadly-athens-blast/7848887.html	2024-11-02T08:48:06-07:00	
Russia jails ex-US consular employee on security charges	MOSCOW — A court in Russia's far east said on Friday it had convicted Robert Shonov, a former U.S. consular employee, of illegally and covertly cooperating with the U.S. government to harm Russia's national security and had jailed him for nearly five years. Russia's FSB security service detained Shonov, a Russian national, in Vladivostok in May 2023 and accused him of taking money to covertly supply U.S. diplomats with information that was potentially harmful to Russia. The United States on Saturday condemned the conviction, calling it 'an egregious injustice.' 'The allegations against Mr. Shonov are entirely fictitious and without merit,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement. A court in the Primorsky region in Russia's far east confirmed in a statement on Friday that it had found Shonov guilty and had sentenced him to four years and 10 months in a penal colony. Video of the verdict being read, released by the court, showed Shonov listening inside a courtroom cage as the judge sentenced him. The FSB published a video in August 2023 showing a purported confession by Shonov in which he said two senior U.S. diplomats based in Moscow whom Russia later expelled had asked him to collect information about Russia's war effort in Ukraine, its annexation of 'new territories,' its military mobilization and the 2024 Russian presidential election. In the video, Shonov said he was told to gather 'negative' information on these topics, to look for signs of popular protest, and to reflect these in his reports. It was not clear whether he was speaking under duress. Shonov was employed by the U.S. Consulate General in Vladivostok for more than 25 years until Russia in 2021 ordered the dismissal of the U.S. mission's local staff.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-jails-ex-us-consular-employee-on-security-charges/7848877.html	2024-11-02T08:38:01-07:00	
Patty to dump rain on the Azores; Tropical Storm Lane to weaken	MIAMI, FLORIDA — A storm system will likely bring heavy rain to the Azores islands over the weekend, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Saturday. Subtropical Storm Patty is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2.5 to 5 centimeters (1 to 2 inches) across the archipelago through Sunday. The Hurricane Center said swells generated by Patty are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Patty is clocking maximum sustained winds of nearly 80 kilometers per mile (50 miles per hour) with higher gusts. The Azores are an island chain are located about 1,290 kilometers (800 miles) from Portugal. Tropical Storm Lane Separately, a tropical storm formed over the Pacific Ocean early Saturday but remained far off the coast of Mexico. Tropical Storm Lane was located about 2,455 kilometers (1,525 miles) west-southwest off the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported in an advisory early Saturday. There were no immediate coastal watches or warnings in effect. The storm is expected to begin weakening sometime Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/patty-to-dump-rain-on-the-azores-tropical-storm-lane-to-weaken/7848867.html	2024-11-02T08:30:04-07:00	
Robot retrieves first melted fuel from Fukushima nuclear reactor	TOKYO — A remote-controlled robot has safely returned with a tiny piece of melted fuel it collected from inside one of three damaged reactors at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant for the first time since the 2011 meltdown. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, said Saturday that the extendable fishing rod-like robot successfully clipped a gravel as big as 5 millimeters, the size of a tiny granola bit, from the top surface of a mound of molten fuel debris that sits on the bottom of the No. 2 reactor’s primary containment vessel. The Telesco robot, with its frontal tongs still holding the melted fuel bit, returned to the enclosed container for safe storage after workers in full hazmat gear pulled it out of the containment vessel earlier Saturday. The sample marks the first time that melted fuel has been retrieved out of the containment vessel. But the mission is not over until it's certain that the sample's radioactivity is below a set standard and safely placed into a container. If the radioactivity exceeds the limit, the robot must go back inside the reactor to find another piece. TEPCO officials said they expect the piece is small enough to meet the requirement. The mission initially started in August for what was supposed to be a two-week round trip but had been suspended twice due to mishaps. The first one was the procedural mistake at the beginning that held up the work for nearly three weeks. Then the robot’s two cameras, designed to transmit views of the target areas for its operators in the remote-control room, failed. The camera problem required the robot to be pulled out all the way for replacement before the mission resumed Monday. Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive molten fuel remains in them, and TEPCO has carried out a number of robotic probes to figure out how to decommission the plant. Telesco on Wednesday successfully clipped a piece presumably measuring less than 3 grams (0.1 ounce) from the planned area right underneath the Unit 2 reactor core, from which large amounts of melted fuel fell during the meltdown 13 years ago, TEPCO said. Plant chief Akira Ono said only the tiny spec can provide key data to plan decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and retroactively learn how the accident developed. The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target for the cleanup, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. No specific plan for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal has been decided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/robot-retrieves-first-melted-fuel-from-fukushima-nuclear-reactor/7848862.html	2024-11-02T08:18:13-07:00	
New leader of British Conservatives is first Black woman in the role	LONDON — Kemi Badenoch became the Conservatives' new leader and the first Black woman to a head a major British political party, after winning a leadership contest Saturday on a promise to return the party to its founding principles. Badenoch, 44, replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and has pledged to lead the party through a period of renewal after its resounding defeat in Britain's July election, saying it had veered toward the political center by 'governing from the left.' On the right of the Conservative Party, Badenoch will likely back policies to shrink the state and challenge what she says is institutional left-wing thinking, saying it is time to defend the principles of free speech, free enterprise and free markets. Badenoch becomes the Conservatives' fifth leader since mid-2016 after winning 57% of party members' votes in the final stage of a monthslong contest that saw a field of six whittled to two. She beat a former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, who received 43% of the votes. Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed her victory, saying 'the first Black leader of a Westminster party is a proud moment for our country.' Badenoch has publicly said she prefers not to focus on her race. Asked at the Conservative Party conference earlier this year how it would feel to become the first Black woman leader of the party, she said: 'I am somebody who wants the color of our skin to be no more significant than the color of our hair or the color of our eyes.' Vaughan Gething became the first Black leader of the Welsh Labour Party earlier this year but resigned after four months as the first minister of Wales after a wave of ministerial resignations in protest over his leadership. 'Tell the truth' Badenoch promised on Saturday to tackle problems in the party head-on. 'The time has come to tell the truth,' she told the audience at the final count of the leadership contest, promising to answer the main questions over how the Conservatives lost the July election so badly. 'It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew.' With forthright views on issues ranging from what she calls identity politics to the value of officials, Badenoch attracts strong admirers and detractors. She is certain to shake up the Conservatives, who saw their contingent of lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament fall in July to 121 from 365 seats in 2019. With the Labour government off to a bumpy start, some Conservatives are increasingly optimistic that they could win back power at the next election, which must be held in 2029. But some more centrist Conservatives worry Badenoch might alienate not only the more moderate wing of the party but also some voters who were won over by the centrist Liberal Democrats at the last election. The former trade minister's time in government was often marked by disputes with the media, celebrities and her own officials. But her no-nonsense approach has also won over many supporters, including the Conservative members who chose her over Jenrick. 'The task that stands before us is tough, but simple,' she told party members. 'Our first responsibility as his majesty's loyal opposition is to hold this Labour government to account. 'Our second is no less important: It is to prepare over the course of the next few years for government.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-leader-of-british-conservatives-is-first-black-woman-in-the-role/7848845.html	2024-11-02T07:52:04-07:00	
Taiwan expects Ukraine-tested weapons from US amid rising Chinese pressure	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan is expected to receive several weapons that have been battle tested in Ukraine from the United States over the next few years. Analysts say those weapons can help bolster Taiwan’s defense and strike capabilities amid growing military pressure from China. In the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan, worth about $2 billion, the United States plans to deliver three medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, also known as NASAMS. The weapons include advanced AMRAAM Extended Range surface-to-air missiles. The proposed sales will help improve Taiwan’s security and 'assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,' the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement released October 26. NASAMS has been battle-tested in Ukraine and is viewed by experts as a significant elevation of Taiwan’s air defense capabilities. Australia and Indonesia are the other countries in the Indo-Pacific region that have received the system from the U.S. Experts say that NASAMS has a high interoperation capability, and that the medium-range air defense system provides needed coverage in Taiwan’s existing air defense capabilities. 'Currently, Taiwan relies on Stinger missiles for short-range air defense while using the Patriot missile system or Taiwan’s indigenous Tien Kung for long-range air defense, so NASAMS can help fill the gap of Taiwan’s medium-range air defense,' said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA by phone that when NASAMS is incorporated into Taiwan’s air defense system, it can improve the island’s capabilities to deal with the increasingly frequent patrols the Chinese military is conducting around Taiwan. 'As Chinese naval vessels and military aircraft increase the frequency of their combat-readiness patrols near Taiwan, the risk of abrupt missile attacks launched by Chinese vessels is also increasing, so acquiring NASAMS can further enhance Taiwan’s capabilities to deal with these potential threats,' Su said. In addition to the surface-to-air missile system, Taiwan’s National Defense Ministry said the island is expected to receive 29 sets of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, from the United States between the end of 2024 and 2026. The rocket system has been credited with helping Ukraine destroy Russian weapons or equipment in the ongoing conflict. Apart from receiving HIMARS from Washington, at least 17 Taiwanese soldiers were trained to use the rocket system at a military base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, this past August. After a post on the military base’s official Facebook page showed Taiwanese soldiers participating in HIMARS training with counterparts from Romania and Estonia, which has since been removed, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Friday that Taiwan had planned to send at least 30 soldiers to receive HIMARS training in the U.S. between February and October this year. Since Ukraine has used HIMARS to strike Russian military bases and weaken the Russian military’s momentum, some Taiwanese experts say the systems potentially can be used to target Chinese military facilities in coastal areas. 'The Taiwanese military can use HIMARS to hit some Chinese military facilities along the southeastern coast or target invading troops in different parts of Taiwan,' said Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight in Taiwan. Overall, Chieh told VOA by phone, the acquisition of NASAMS and HIMARS can enhance Taiwan’s capabilities in conducting network-centric warfare and deter China from easily launching an attack against Taiwan. Other analysts say the series of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan reflects Washington’s commitment to supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, but China will interpret the latest developments as a provocation from Taiwan and the U.S. 'Beijing will interpret this as changing the status quo [across the Taiwan Strait] nevertheless,' Stephen Nagy, a regional security expert at the International Christian University in Japan, told VOA in a written response. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and repeatedly has vowed to reunify with the island, by force, if necessary. In response to the latest U.S. arms sales to Taiwan last week, Beijing condemned it and urged Washington to stop what it called dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China showcases its naval capability The arms sales and training come as China’s two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, conducted a dual formation exercise for the first time in the disputed South China Sea from late September to October. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping told the state-run China Daily newspaper that the exercise will allow the two Chinese aircraft carriers to 'integrate and magnify the power' and 'enable the fleet to better organize strikes and handle threats from air and sea.' Chieh in Taiwan said China is showing the U.S. it could assert maritime claims in disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific region at a time when U.S. aircraft carriers are deployed to the Middle East. 'Since the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has forced the U.S. to deploy its aircraft carrier groups to the region, China is trying to remind Washington that it can impose control over certain parts of the Indo-Pacific region amid an American absence,' he said. Nagy in Japan said that while China can demonstrate its capability to operate aerial and naval assets near areas of potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific region — such as the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait — such a formation also exposes the Chinese aircraft carriers as obvious targets for more experienced fighting forces. 'Losing one or two of China’s few aircraft carriers would have a very serious reputational cost for the Chinese Communist Party, and the U.S. and its partners understand this, so they are preparing for their scenarios,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-expects-ukraine-tested-weapons-from-us-amid-rising-chinese-pressure/7848827.html	2024-11-02T07:25:33-07:00

War makes it harder to hold journalists’ killers accountable, experts say	WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — Achieving justice in the targeted killings of journalists is a difficult task made even more complicated in cases that take place in wartime, experts say. On a global scale, 85% of journalist killings around the world since 2006 remain unsolved, according to a report released by UNESCO on Saturday. In 2013, the United Nations declared November 2 the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. Impunity in journalist killings has long been the norm, and active conflict exacerbates the problem, according to Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. 'You have fewer resources to devote to investigations,' Ginsberg told VOA. 'Courts are often overwhelmed. The ability to do investigations is hampered because there’s a live conflict going on.' That has been the case in the Israel-Hamas war, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, civil war in Myanmar and gang violence in Haiti. The war in Gaza With the Israel-Hamas war, as of October 31, at least 134 journalists and media workers — primarily Palestinians — have been killed since the conflict began last year, according to CPJ. CPJ has determined that the Israeli military targeted five of them in direct connection to their work as journalists. Israel ranks second worst in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings, according to CPJ’s index, which was published Wednesday. In one incident on October 13, 2023, the Israeli military fired two tank shells 37 seconds apart in southern Lebanon in the direction of media crews. The journalists were about one mile from the closest hostilities, wore vests marked 'PRESS' and stood next to a car marked 'TV,' according to reports. The attack killed Lebanese Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injured six other reporters. CPJ and news outlets have determined the case was a deliberate attack. At the time, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said Israeli forces would never want to 'kill or shoot any journalist' who is working, but that 'in a state of war, things might happen. We regret them, we feel sorry.' The ambassador said that Israel would investigate. 'I’m dismayed that there has been no accountability since the attack on October 13, but not surprised,' Ginsberg told VOA in September in New York. Impunity in journalist killings has been a problem in Israel for decades, she added. CPJ is investigating the possible targeted killings of 10 more journalists in the Israel-Hamas war. Determining what happened is difficult because of the conflict and restrictions on access for foreign media to Gaza. 'Anyone responsible for the killing of a journalist, of a civilian, should be prosecuted and held accountable. Journalists are civilians. They’re not targets,' Ginsberg said. Israel’s military did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story. Israel has previously denied targeting journalists. The civil war in Myanmar Accountability is also difficult in Myanmar’s civil war. Since the military launched a coup in 2021, more than 5,000 civilians have been killed, more than 27,000 people have been arrested, and more than 3.3 million people have been displaced, according to the U.N. human rights office. At least seven journalists have been killed over their work since the coup, according to CPJ. Three of those killings took place this year, including two who were killed by security forces in a raid on their house and another who was killed in military custody. Tom Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told VOA: 'The assault on the media, the assault on journalism, the assault on the principle of the freedom of the press, is all part of their stock-in-trade to hide their systematic assaults on the people of Myanmar.' Myanmar ranks 10th in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings, according to CPJ. Myanmar’s military did not reply to VOA’s request for comment. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine has also led to calls for accountability. While Russia does not appear on the 2024 Impunity Index — which looks at targeted killings only — at least 15 journalists and media workers have been killed covering the war, according to CPJ. 'Without accountability, we’re essentially giving a green light for further attacks on journalists not only in Ukraine but potentially in future conflicts worldwide,' National Union of Journalists of Ukraine President Sergiy Tomilenko told VOA in an email. 'Protecting journalists isn’t just about individual cases — it’s about defending democracy and the right to truth. Each unpunished attack on a journalist emboldens those who want to silence independent media,' Tomilenko said. Russia’s Washington embassy and Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Among the cases of journalists killed is that of Viktoria Roshchyna, a Ukrainian journalist who died in Russian custody in September. The circumstances surrounding Roshchyna’s death remain unclear because the Russian government has refused to return her body to Ukraine. Without a body, it will be difficult to determine how she died, according to Karol Luczka, who monitors Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'This is a particularly appalling case of impunity,' he said. Based on UNESCO data, a journalist was killed every four days for doing their job in 2022 and 2023. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay called on member states to do more to hold perpetrators of these crimes accountable. 'Prosecuting and convicting the perpetrators is a major lever to prevent future attacks on journalists,' she said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/war-makes-it-harder-to-hold-journalists-killers-accountable-experts-say/7848766.html	2024-11-02T05:42:04-07:00	
Spain braces for more flood deaths, steps up aid	VALENCIA, SPAIN — Rescuers resumed a grim search for bodies on Saturday as Spain scrambled to organize aid to stricken citizens following devastating floods that killed more than 200 people. Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of mud-filled water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades. Almost all deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of soldiers, police officers and civil guards were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies. Officials have said that dozens of people remain unaccounted for, but establishing a precise figure is difficult with telephone and transport networks severely damaged. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that 207 people had died and that it was 'reasonable' to believe more fatalities would emerge. It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again. Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages — some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days — is a priority. Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some residents have also complained that the response to the disaster is too slow. Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered 'from day one' to all accessible settlements. But it was 'logical' that affected residents were asking for more, she said. Authorities in Valencia have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively. 'Overwhelmed' by solidarity Thousands of people pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the effort to clean up. Camarero said some municipalities were 'overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food' they had received. The surge of solidarity continued Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia toward nearby towns laid waste by the floods, an AFP journalist saw. Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez chaired a meeting of a crisis committee made up of top cabinet members on Saturday and is due to address the country later. The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year. But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-braces-for-more-flood-deaths-steps-up-aid/7848734.html	2024-11-02T03:42:34-07:00	
Jury convicts ex-officer of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor	LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead. The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor's neighbors. It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid. Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor but chose to continue deliberating. The six-man, six-woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days. Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: 'It took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.' Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor's glass door and windows during the raid but didn't hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor's adjoining apartment. The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked racial injustice protests nationwide. Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict 'a long-awaited moment of accountability.' 'While it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,' King said in a social media post Friday night. A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022. The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings. Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor's door with a battering ram. This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots. That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must 'prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive' when Hankison fired. After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating. Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor's glass door and a window. Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker's fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway. Hankison's lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly 'in a very tense, very chaotic environment' that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison's shots didn't hit anyone. Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor's civil rights. Hankison's verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case. Malarcik, Hankison's attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor's boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sergeant John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark. 'Brett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,' Malarcik said. Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn't see a target. They said in closing arguments that Hankison 'violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force: If they cannot see the person they're shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.' Neither of the officers who shot Taylor — Mattingly and former Detective Myles Cosgrove — were charged in Taylor's death. Federal and state prosecutors have said those officers were justified in returning fire, since Taylor's boyfriend shot at them first.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jury-convicts-ex-officer-of-using-excessive-force-on-breonna-taylor/7848729.html	2024-11-02T03:27:21-07:00	
Japan urges 200,000 people to evacuate due to heavy rain	Tokyo — Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods, while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country. The Japan Meteorological Agency said 'warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan' partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon. The city of Matsuyama 'issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety,' a city official told AFP. While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred. Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday. Due to rain, Shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule. Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least three lives and injured 690 people, according to the National Fire Agency, which added a migrant worker death to the toll on Saturday. The storm knocked out power to 957,061 households, 27,781 of which were still in the dark as of Saturday. Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-urges-200-000-people-to-evacuate-due-to-heavy-rain/7848720.html	2024-11-02T02:47:28-07:00	
Russia targets Kyiv in hours-long drone attack	KYIV, Ukraine — Russia unleashed an overnight drone attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv that lasted into late morning and wounded at least one person, city officials said on Saturday. Debris from downed drones struck six city districts, wounding a police officer, damaging residential buildings and starting fires, according to city military administrator Serhiy Popko. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko had earlier reported that two people had been injured. 'Another night. Another air-raid alert. Another drone attack. The armed forces of the Russian Federation attacked Kyiv again according to their old and familiar tactics,' Popko wrote on social media. He said all the drones aimed at Kyiv had been shot down, but warned that others currently located in airspace outside the city could turn toward the capital. Reuters correspondents reported hearing explosions in and around the city during an air-raid alert that lasted more than five hours. Russia has carried out regular airstrikes on Ukrainian towns and cities behind the front lines of the war which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022. Kyiv's military said on Friday that Moscow's forces had launched more than 2,000 drones at civilian and military targets across Ukraine in October alone. Russia has denied aiming at civilians and said power facilities are legitimate targets when they are part of Ukrainian military infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-targets-kyiv-in-hours-long-drone-attack/7848717.html	2024-11-02T02:35:23-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader threatens Israel and US with 'a crushing response' over Israeli attack	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the U.S. with 'a crushing response' over attacks on Iran and its allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its October 26 on the Islamic Republic that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people. Any further attacks from either side could engulf the wider Middle East, already teetering over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon, into a wider regional conflict just head of the U.S. presidential election this Tuesday. 'The enemies, whether the Zionist regime or the United States of America, will definitely receive a crushing response to what they are doing to Iran and the Iranian nation and to the resistance front,' Khamenei said in video released by Iranian state media. The supreme leader did not elaborate on the timing of the threatened attack, nor the scope. The U.S. military operates throughout the Middle East, with some troops now manning a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, battery in Israel. The 85-year-old Khamenei had struck a more cautious approach in earlier remarks, saying officials would weigh Iran's response and that Israel's attack 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed.' Khamenei on Saturday met with university students to mark Students Day, which commemorates a November 4, 1978, incident in which Iranian soldiers opened fire on students protesting the rule of the shah at Tehran University. The shooting killed and wounded several students and further escalated the tensions consuming Iran at the time that eventually led to the shah fleeing the country and the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The crowd offered a raucous welcome to Khamenei, chanting: 'The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader!' Some also made a hand gesture given by the slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2020 in a speech in which he threatened that American troops would 'return in coffins.' Iran will mark the 45th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis this Sunday, following the Persian calendar. The November 4, 1979, storming of the embassy by Islamist students led to the 444-day crisis, which cemented the decades-long enmity between Tehran and Washington that persists today.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-threatens-israel-and-us-with-a-crushing-response-over-israeli-attack/7848714.html	2024-11-02T02:20:25-07:00	
Israel’s attack on Iran has left Tehran offensively and defensively weaker	Iran was quick to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on key military sites on its territory on October 26. But satellite images suggest Israel has degraded Tehran's air defense and missile-production capabilities, analysts say. Fabian Hinz of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel had dealt a 'significant blow' to Iran's ability to produce long-range ballistic missiles. Ability to sustain long-range attacks On October 1, Iran launched its biggest-ever direct attack on Israel, firing nearly 200 ballistic missiles at its archenemy. Dozens of the missiles, aimed mostly at military sites, penetrated Israel's formidable air defenses. Israel's retaliatory strikes on October 26 were aimed at hindering Iran's production of solid-propellant ballistic missiles that were used by Tehran in its assault, the 'weapons that are of most concern to Israel,' Hinz said. Solid-propellant missiles require fewer personnel and little time to prepare for launch compared to liquid-propellant missiles, Hinz explains, making them ideal for launching volleys in quick succession. Israel struck missile-production sites around Tehran, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. Jeremy Binnie, a Middle East defense specialist at the global intelligence company Janes, says the full extent of the damage caused to the facilities is still unclear. But he adds that Israel likely wanted to prevent Iran from being able to sustain long-range missile exchanges, especially given the numbers it needs to penetrate Israel's formidable air defenses. 'The Israelis probably don't know precisely how many ballistic missiles [Iran] has with the requisite range, but have tried to reduce its ability to replenish is stockpile,' Binnie said. Blinded offensively and defensively? Israel's attack was also aimed at weakening Iran's ability to fend off aerial attacks by targeting its radars and Russian-made S-300 air-defense systems. There have been unconfirmed reports quoting U.S. and Israeli officials claiming that three S-300 systems were taken out in the Israeli attack. 'The S-300s are Iran's most capable air-defense capabilities, so targeting them again emphasizes Iran's inability to defend itself and gives the Israeli Air Force more freedom of operation in the future,' Binnie said. Satellite images also showed that at least two radar systems -- one in the western Ilam Province and another in the southwestern Khuzestan Province -- were hit. The radars are an essential part of Iran's early warning system, Hinz told RFE/RL's Radio Farda. Taking them out, he said, would mean Israel had 'degraded Iran's ability to resist any air attack even further, making it more vulnerable.' Fox News quoted a U.S. defense official as saying that the radars also had an offensive purpose, and have been used by Iran to track ballistic missiles after launch to assess their trajectories and course-correct if necessary. Binnie said that 'would be unusual but might explain how [Iran] has achieved a fairly high level of accuracy with its ballistic missiles -- though not good enough to do really significant damage.' Impact on Iranian retaliation There are growing numbers of reports that Tehran is considering retaliating against Israel as the extent of the damage caused by the October 26 attack becomes clearer. Given that Iran has suffered damage to both its offensive and defensive capabilities, it is unclear if it can launch another large-scale attack on Israel, experts say. Binnie said the United States' deployment to Israel of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), an advanced anti-missile system, will further 'swing the balance in [Israel's] favor.' Media reports citing Israeli sources say that Iran is preparing to launch an aerial attack on Israel using Tehran-backed Shi'ite militant groups in Iraq. That would suggest the Islamic republic hopes its proxies will absorb the brunt of a potential Israeli response.

New Zealand city waves goodbye to its 'disturbing' giant hand	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Perched on two fingers on the roof of an art gallery in Wellington, New Zealand, the giant sculpture of a hand has loomed over the city for five years. Named Quasi, the 16-foot — almost 5-meter — creation of Australia-based sculptor Ronnie van Hout bears an unsmiling human face — because why not? Some found it disturbing, and now, after five years of provoking controversy and myriad emotions — from horror and revulsion to delight — among residents of New Zealand's capital, Quasi was set to be removed from the roof of City Gallery this week. It will be taken to a new home, the gallery said Wednesday. 'This is either a great day for Wellington or a terrible day for Wellington and there's not much view in between,' said Ben McNulty, a Wellington city council member. McNulty told The Associated Press he felt 'devastated' by the sculpture's departure. Quasi is made of steel, polystyrene and resin, and was based on scans of van Hout's hand and face. It was named in part for Quasimodo, the bellringer in Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Hence, the male gender some have attributed to Quasi. Quasi first graced — or haunted — an art gallery in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2016 but proved polarizing. It was the subject of an op-ed in the local newspaper listing reasons the sculpture 'must go,' including claims that one of its outstretched fingers 'appears to be inappropriately and belligerently pointing at pedestrians and office workers.' 'Perhaps the monster just wants to be loved?' van Hout responded at the time. In 2019, Quasi was installed in Wellington, where he grew over time on its residents. 'He arrived and I won't say the city unanimously hated him but I reckon 80% were like, 'What is this monster? What have we done?' ' McNulty said. 'But I think that over time there's been a bit of a softening, there's sort of a pro-Quasi group, which I consider myself part of,' he added. On Wednesday, many at Wellington's Civic Square, where the gallery with Quasi is located, said they had warmed to him, too. 'It's really disturbing but it's a staple of Wellington now,' said Anja Porthouse, who had brought friends and family to see Quasi and was 'gutted' it was leaving. Quasi is to be lifted from the roof by helicopter on Saturday, when the giant hand will travel to an undisclosed location in Australia, the gallery said. 'Everything comes to an end eventually,' van Hout told the AP. 'I am sure it will be missed, but even Lovecraftian nightmares have to return to where they came from, and now you only have an absence to reflect on.' Dozens responded to the news on social media with dismay, glee and jokes about the curse that local lore has attributed to Quasi being lifted. The sculpture has adorned the Wellington skyline during 'some of its most difficult times,' McNulty said. The city has struggled with earthquake-prone buildings, widespread plumbing problems and political division in recent years. Other comments took guesses about where Quasi might end up. 'He's going to The Hague,' wrote one New Zealander on X. 'He will be missed,' said Jane Black, who heads the Wellington Sculpture Trust. 'I'll personally be pleased to see it head somewhere else for a change,' the city's mayor, Tory Whanau, told the AP. 'I think there's a strong feeling of relief.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-city-waves-goodbye-to-its-disturbing-giant-hand/7845742.html	2024-11-02T01:09:21-07:00	
At 50, Hello Kitty is as 'kawaii' — and lucrative — as ever	tokyo — Hello Kitty turned 50 on Friday. Befitting a pop icon at midlife, the bubble-headed, bow-wearing character's fictional birthday has brought museum exhibits, a theme park spectacle and a national tour. And that's just in Japan, her literal birthplace but not the one listed in her official biography. Confused? Welcome to the party. If there's one thing about Hello Kitty, it's that she's proven adaptable and as much a study in contrasts during her long career. She — and Kitty is a she, according to the company that owns her — may have been conceived as a vessel for the feelings of others, but some women see an empowering symbol in her mouthless face. 'Shrewd' is how Mika Nishimura, a design professor at Tokyo's Meisei University, describes the way Hello Kitty conquered the worlds of commerce, fashion and entertainment. As a tabula rasa open to interpretation, the non-threatening creation was the perfect vehicle for making money, she said. 'American feminists have said she doesn't say anything and acquiesces to everyone. But in Japan, we also see how she may appear happy if you're happy, and sad if you're feeling sad,' Nishimura told The Associated Press. 'It's a product strategy that's sheer genius. By being so adaptable, Kitty gets all those collaborative deals.' The character's semicentennial is evidence of that. Sanrio, the Japanese entertainment company that holds the rights to Hello Kitty's name and image, kicked off the festivities a year ago with an animation account on TikTok, Roblox games and an avatar for the social networking app Zepeto. There have been anniversary editions of merchandise ranging from pet collars, cosmetics and McDonald's Happy Meals to Crocs and a Baccarat crystal figurine. A gold coin pendant with the image of Hello Kitty holding the number 50 is selling for about 120,000 yen ($800), while a Casio watch costs 18,700 yen ($120). But first, more on the origin story. Unlike Mickey Mouse and Snoopy, Hello Kitty didn't start as a cartoon. A young Sanrio illustrator named Yuko Shimizu drew her in 1974 as a decoration for stationery, tote bags, cups and other small accessories. The design made its debut on a coin purse the next year and became an instant hit in Japan. As Hello Kitty's commercial success expanded beyond Asia, so did her personal profile. By the late 1970s, Sanrio revealed the character's name as Kitty White, her height as five apples tall and her birthplace as suburban London, where the company said she lived with her parents and twin sister Mimmy. 'The main theme of Hello Kitty is friendship. When I first created it, I made a family of which Kitty was a part. But then Hello Kitty started to appear in other settings as the character grew,' Shimizu told the BBC in June. 'Sanrio put a lot of effort into building the brand into what it is today.' At some point, Sanrio designated Kitty's birthday as November 1, the same as Shimizu's. Her background was embellished with hobbies that included playing piano, reading and baking. Her TV appearances required co-stars, including a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty that made its debut 20 years ago. But Hello Kitty's 40th birthday brought an update that astonished fans. Sanrio clarified to a Los Angeles museum curator that Kitty, despite her feline features, was a little girl. A company spokesperson repeated the distinction this year, renewing debate online about the requirements for being considered human. 'She is supposed to be Kitty White and English. But this is part of the enigma: Who is Hello Kitty? We can't figure it out. We don't even know if she is a cat,' art historian Joyce S. Cheng, a University of Oregon associate professor, said. 'There is an unresolved indeterminacy about her that is so amazing.' Part of the confusion stems from a misunderstanding of 'kawaii,' which is Japanese for 'cute' but also connotes a lovable or adorable essence. Sanrio recruited Shimizu and other illustrators to create 'kawaii' characters at a time when cute, girlish styles were popular in Japan. But the word is used often in Japanese society, and not only to describe babies and puppies. An elderly man, something as innocuous as an umbrella, a subcompact car or a kitchen utensil, or even a horror movie monster can get labeled 'kawaii.' By Western standards, the idea may seem embarrassingly frivolous. But it's taken seriously in Japan, where the concept is linked with the most honorable instincts. The complexity of 'kawaii' may help explain Hello Kitty's enduring appeal across generations and cultures, why Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne released a song titled 'Hello Kitty' a decade ago, and why Britain's King Charles wished Hello Kitty a happy 50th birthday when he hosted Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako at Buckingham Palace in June. Although Hello Kitty may seem to embody the self-sacrificing woman stereotype, it's revealing that three women have served as the character's chief designers at Sanrio. Yuko Yamaguchi, who has held the role since 1980, is credited with keeping the character both modern and timeless, giving Kitty black outfits or false eyelashes as trends dictated but never removing the bow from her left ear. 'Hello Kitty, this cultural object, has something to tell us about the history of women in East Asia, and how East Asian women modernized themselves and became professional citizens in a modern society,' the University of Oregon's Cheng said. Sanrio has come up with hundreds of creatures, all adorable and cuddly, but none with the lasting power of Hello Kitty. Forget the understated wabi-sabi aesthetic historically associated with Japan. A chameleon-like cat-girl who reflects unabashed kitsch is the cultural ambassador of a consumer-crazed, happy-go-lucky nation. 'It's the anti-wabi sabi, wanting to be as flashy and as bling-bling as possible, like Lady Gaga. In your face, but that's actually part of the genius, too. It's powerful,' Cheng said. Leslie Bow, a professor of English and Asian American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that while many Asian and Asian American women see Hello Kitty as a symbol of defiance, the protective, caretaking instinct aroused by 'kawaii' isn't without power. 'We take care of our siblings, our babies, our pets, because we are in control. We control their actions. And so that is also the dark side of cute,' Bow said. Sanrio has taken advantage of the character's adaptability by allowing relatively unrestricted use of her image in return for a licensing fee. Just about anything goes for the wee whiskered one, from a growing global empire of Sanrio-sanctioned Hello Kitty cafes to an 'augmented reality' cellphone app that shows Kitty dancing in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, London's Big Ben and other tourist landmarks. On the unsanctioned side, Hello Kitty even has shown up on guns and vibrators. During a presentation earlier this year in Seoul, Hello Kitty designer Yamaguchi said one of her unfulfilled goals was finding a way 'to develop a Hello Kitty for men to fall in love with as well.' But she's still working on it. 'I am certain the day will come when men are no longer embarrassed to carry around Hello Kitty,' entertainment news site Content Asia quoted Yamaguchi as saying.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-50-hello-kitty-is-as-kawaii-and-lucrative-as-ever-/7847239.html	2024-11-02T01:08:35-07:00	
On Pakistan's southern coast, surfers chase waves and their dreams	KARACHI, Pakistan — Attiq Ur Rehman is determined to follow his dream to become Pakistan's first professional surfer despite his father's concern for his future, a lack of equipment and the messy waves near Karachi. 'I don’t care about the money right now. I just want to compete,' the 21-year-old says, shrugging off his father's plea to take up fishing so he can get married and support his family. 'It's my surfer attitude.' Rehman's family are part of a poor coastal community in southern Pakistan that usually make a living from fishing or as lifeguards watching over more affluent residents of Karachi when they come for a day at the beach. His father makes the equivalent of $100 a month to feed a family of 10 through fishing. 'I told him a thousand times (to stop surfing) but he still doesn't listen,' said Rehman's father, Muhammad Rafiq. Rehman was a lifeguard but gave it up to concentrate on his surfing, which he started at age 9, and founded a new community that calls itself 'Surfers of Bulleji.' The group has grown to around 50 and has gone viral on social media in a country where cricket and hockey are the main sports. The group consists of surfing enthusiasts from surrounding coastal villages, some as young as 8. On a sunny day, their passion for surfing is on display with the right window for waves to surf along a near-empty beach close to the metropolis of 20 million. One of cohort, Mujahid Baloch, a 24-year-old fisherman, first saw surfing on social media and instantly took a shine to it. 'Slowly, through watching, we learned. No one taught us,' he said. Though Sri Lanka and the Maldives to the south are on global surfers' hit lists, Pakistan's arid 1,000 kilometers of coastline is usually poorly suited for surfing, relying on local winds to generate waves that are often small and messy, or rare cyclone swells. 'When all of Karachi was being given an advisory to stay away from the sea, and a cyclone was approaching, me and the boys were getting ready to go to the beach,' said Rehman. 'The waves were ideal for us.' While an occasional visiting surfer might join them for a paddle and some other villages along the coast have small surfing groups, competition with global peers is a challenge. The International Surfing Association has 116 member countries, including places such as Ukraine and land-locked Switzerland, but Pakistan is not on the list. Still, members of Surfers of Bulleji idolize American professional surfer Kelly Slater, whose videos they often watch awestruck, and wish to emulate his skill. But access to surfing equipment is limited in Pakistan, with the group sharing about 25 surfboards and pitching in for repairs when they are needed. They sometimes find discarded boards in large containers of junk brought to Pakistan from around the world. They buy these junked boards for as little as $35 and repair them using basic materials like glue and resin. 'If it breaks, we repair it. Because we don't have surfboards here,' Baloch said. Pointing to a piece of foam, he said it was found at sea and shaped into a makeshift board. 'If we find more such foam, we can make our own boards here,' he said. 'Our community is getting bigger and stronger, so the shopkeepers know we will come and keep such finds safe for us,' Rehman said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-pakistan-s-southern-coast-surfers-chase-waves-and-their-dreams/7847300.html	2024-11-02T01:06:57-07:00	
Canada-India tensions could escalate cyber threats, hinder immigration	OTTAWA — Canada's deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary national security committee on Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the mastermind behind the alleged plots. While Indian officials dismissed the official's statement, the disclosure might worsen a dispute that started a year ago when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cited credible evidence linking Indian agents to the June 2023 shooting of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. In response, Canada expelled six Indian diplomats earlier this month, accusing them of involvement. Four men have been charged with his murder. The Canadian signals intelligence agency that monitors foreign-based cyber threats said New Delhi was most likely already conducting threatening cyber activity against Canadian networks for spying purposes. 'As Canada and India potentially may have some tensions, it is possible that we may see India want to flex those cyber threat actions against Canadians,' Caroline Xavier, head of the agency, known as Communications Security Establishment Canada, told a Wednesday news conference. The agency has previously described India as an emerging threat. On the diplomatic front, Ottawa is unlikely to take more punitive steps until more details of the Nijjar case emerge, said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada think tank. Cabinet ministers are due to testify about the matter to the national security committee and the murder trial of the four men has yet to start, she noted. 'If there are charges laid in the process on individuals that are living in India at whatever level, then it would trigger an extradition process which could take years. And of course, India is unlikely to cooperate,' she said. Officials working for Trudeau and Foreign Minister Melanie Joly did not respond to requests for comment about what steps Ottawa might take next. India is the top source for temporary foreign workers and international students coming to Canada, but a backlog of applications has built since Trudeau's allegations last year. Canada only has four immigration officials left in India, down from 27 in October 2023. This affects Canada's ability to process visas on-site, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. 'I have told my colleagues in Parliament that this could get worse before it gets better, and they need to brace for it,' he said in an interview last Friday. That could mean fewer people traveling between the countries for legitimate reasons, he said. Trade relations India is Canada's 10th largest trading partner and New Delhi has made clear it does not want flows to be hit. Nadjibulla's foundation carried out a study showing Trudeau's statement in October 2023 had little or no effect on bilateral trade. 'Whether that would be the case now I think it's a bigger question mark, because the disruption is on a bigger scale, and we are still not, I don't believe, at the bottom of this,' she said by phone. Canada is the biggest exporter of pulses, such as lentils, to India. Pulse Canada President Greg Cherewyk, asked about the potential impact of the diplomatic dispute, cited the strength of the relationship. 'In a time of stubborn food price inflation and strong demand for pulse crops, we are confident that affordability and availability will continue to drive decision-making at a government level,' he said in a statement. 'We have thankfully not seen the political tensions affect trade,' said Michael Harvey, executive director of the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance. 'India and Canada have great potential in their trading relationship and CAFTA hopes we can work back to positive trade discussions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-india-tensions-could-escalate-cyber-threats-hinder-immigration/7847233.html	2024-11-02T01:06:13-07:00	
Vinyl thrives at United Record Pressing, oldest record maker in US	NASHVILLE, Tenn. — During the six decades since United Record Pressing stamped out the Beatles' first U.S. single, the country's oldest vinyl record maker has survived 8-tracks, cassettes, CDs, Napster, iPods and streaming services. Now, the Nashville-based company has rebounded so dramatically that some of its equipment and technology has been retrofitted to keep pace with an ever-growing demand for old-school vinyl. The 75-year-old company has adjusted its business from filling jukeboxes to helping DJs spin and stocking shelves despite a pandemic. On shelves in its warehouse are master versions by Johnny Cash, Kanye West and The Black Crowes. When Mark Michaels bought the company in 2007, vinyl was fading — its 38 employees mostly made singles for rap artists, often promos for clubs. Michaels wanted a hands-on chance to build a business and thought he could keep this one steady, but not grow it substantially. It also came with a rich history as the first record pressing plant in the South, including an apartment atop the factory that housed Black artists and music executives during segregation. 'You walked into this building and you just felt 50, 60 years of history and just the importance of what it stood for,' said Michaels, the company's CEO and chair. 'And yeah, you you get choked up, you get gooseflesh just experiencing that.' Today, United Record Pressing runs a newer factory six times bigger than what Michaels bought, with about 125 employees who make up to 80,000 records a day. A variety of factors have boosted vinyl in recent years, from independent artists insisting on vinyl albums to big box retailers getting on board again. In 2023, U.S. revenues from vinyl records grew 10% to $1.4 billion, the 17th-straight year of growth, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Records accounted for 71% of revenues from non-digital music formats, and for the second time since 1987, vinyl outpaced CDs in total sold. United Record Pressing underwent its own evolution. The initial pressing plant was formed in 1949 by Nashville label Bullet Records. In the 1950s, it changed to Southern Plastics Inc. and focused on 7-inch singles preferred by jukebox makers. In the early 1960s, the company was pressing more than 1 million records per month. It signed a deal to produce singles for Motown Records and moved to a bigger facility that included the apartment that hosted The Supremes, Smokey Robinson and others — and which became known as the 'Motown Suite.' In 1963, it pressed the Beatles' first U.S. single, 'Please Please Me.' Then in the 1970s, a restructuring turned the company into United Record Pressing. During the 1980s, records dwindled to a niche market. DJs still needed records for their turntables. Rap and hip-hop artists used them for 'scratching.' But CDs had overtaken them. By the late 2000s, indie artists were insisting on releasing vinyl records. By 2015, records were broadly embraced again, but there were few manufacturers, and they were relying on presses from the 1960s and 1970s and a limited number of specialists who could operate them, Michaels said. Demand increased again during the coronavirus pandemic. 'It's art,' Michaels said of vinyl records. 'Artists and fans, they want something tactile to hold on to and engage with. It's easy to stream music, and streaming music is a wonderful way to discover new music. But you know, at the end of the day, it's kind of sonic wallpaper.' Today, the factory mixes old and new. There's plenty of wood paneling on the throwback audio equipment used to test master versions of records before they are used to press copies. And the factory floor has its share of retrofitted pressing equipment that looks and sounds like it's been around since the last time vinyl ruled the market. Technology is improving the process, too. Beyond the older presses are sleek, newly made machines that plop out records more quietly and efficiently. And there are huge sacks of colorful pebbles from discarded material that can be pressed again into new records. The machines that stamp master copies use technology that had been in place to produce CDs and DVDs, now retooled for vinyl. In a room farther back in the factory, the whizzing of machinery gives way to music. That's where Tyler Bryant might listen to 10 records in a shift as the company's quality control lead. Talking over the rhythms of harmonica from a Cash album, Bryant said he discovers many artists and records that wouldn't be on his list, ranging from Harry Styles to Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' to indie artists. 'A lot of variety, that's what I appreciate,' Bryant said. 'I don't like being stuck to just one genre, you know?' A few miles away, architects and a construction crew are at work to preserve the old 1962 plant and pave the way for its future. As for what that will look like, Michaels says stay tuned. 'My vision is not completely crystallized yet, but the mandate is, it's some of the most important space in all of music,' Michaels said. 'It needs to be celebrated. It needs to be something that people can engage with.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vinyl-thrives-at-united-record-pressing-oldest-record-maker-in-us/7845767.html	2024-11-02T01:04:54-07:00	
Missile strike in central Israel injures 19	Israeli police say at least 19 people have been injured by a missile strike in the city of Tira, some 25 kilometers northeast of Tel Aviv, after the military reported three projectiles were fired from Lebanon into central Israel early Saturday. The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted videos on social media showing fire and smoke spilling from a building and emergency responders at the site. 'This is the result of a direct hit of a Hezbollah rocket on a building in the Israeli Arab town of Tira, injuring 19 civilians,' the ministry said in the post, adding Israel will not rest until Hezbollah is dismantled. The Israeli army said on the social media platform Telegram that it had intercepted some of the projectiles. Israel airstrikes pounded Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early Friday, killing at least 52 people, wounding 72 others and sending families fleeing from their homes. Video from the scene showed some buildings in rubble as smoke rose above the skyline. Israeli warplanes also destroyed dozens of buildings Friday in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, but there were no reports of causalities. Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported that seven people were killed in northern Israel by cross-border rocket attacks from Hezbollah. In statement posted to its X social media account, the IDF said during the night Thursday into Friday, its fighter jets 'attacked with precise intelligence' sites for weapons production, as well as what it said were Hezbollah central headquarters and other 'military infrastructures' in the Beirut area. The IDF said its fighter jets also attacked overnight what it described as Hezbollah's 'southern front' headquarters throughout Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. They said advance warnings were given to the population in the area to mitigate the risk to civilians. Lebanon's state National News Agency, or NNA, reported Lebanon's acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, said Friday the overnight strikes and the 'expansion of Israeli aggression' in Lebanon show that Israel 'rejects all efforts' to reach a cease-fire. Earlier this week he had expressed hope for the possibility of such an agreement. In Gaza, doctors and local sources reported more than 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza overnight Thursday into Friday. Officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told The Washington Post that 26 bodies arrived at the hospital, including 21 from Nuseirat refugee camp. The leaders of 15 U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations said Friday, 'the situation unfolding in northern Gaza is apocalyptic.' The officials, which included the heads of the World Health Organization, World Food Program and children's agency UNICEF said, 'The entire region is on the edge of a precipice' and said Palestinians have been denied basic humanitarian aid and lifesaving supplies. The IDF said in a statement its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. They also told the AP they had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and had targeted a militant who was operating in the Nuseirat area. The violence comes as U.S. diplomats, including U.S. CIA Director William Burns, left the region this week after a series of meetings to push for a cease-fire. A senior Hamas leader, Taher al-Nunu, told news outlets Friday that the militant group has rejected the latest short term cease-fire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar because it did not include a lasting cease-fire. At a news conference Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he remains optimistic regarding peace and cease-fire efforts on both fronts. Regarding Lebanon, Blinken said once again, the basis of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis would be the effective implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its armed presence from an area south of the Litani River and for Israeli forces to get out of Lebanon. Blinken made the comments at a joint briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two held talks Friday with their South Korean counterparts in Washington. Blinken was asked about a letter he and Austin sent to Israel, calling on Tel Aviv to take steps to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza or face possible restrictions on U.S. military aid. The secretary of state said their teams are tracking 'very carefully' Israel's response and efforts regarding humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Blinken said there has been 'progress' but added it has been insufficient. 'We're working on a daily basis to make sure that Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken said. 'It's not enough to get trucks to Gaza; it's vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza.' Blinken also mentioned the World Health Organization's successful initial polio vaccination campaign for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. He said for that campaign to be concluded, there must be a second round of vaccinations completed quickly, and he called on Israel to facilitate that effort. The WHO said Friday the next phase of the polio vaccination campaign will begin Saturday after being postponed from October 23 due to a lack of access and a lack of humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,259 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, where the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-strike-in-central-israel-injures-19/7848694.html	2024-11-02T00:59:18-07:00	
Argentina's public universities are paralyzed by protests; here’s why	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — After 11 months in office, Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei has fulfilled his flagship pledge to eliminate the country's monumental deficits by shrinking the public payroll, slashing subsidies and suppressing already low wages of state workers. The austerity has spawned misery. But with the country's left-wing opposition in disarray after delivering the economic disaster that Milei inherited, Argentina hasn't seen the kind of widespread social unrest that has characterized past economic crises. That could change. The country's teachers are fed up. Milei's recent veto of a bill boosting spending on university budgets struck a collective nerve in a nation that long has considered free education a critical engine of social progress, drawing the broadest demonstrations since the libertarian leader took office. Last week's open-air classes held in Plaza de Mayo, the main square home to government headquarters, marked the latest in a new wave of protests supporting public universities that has gripped Argentina over the past month. Students are taking over college campuses in the coming days ahead of another mass protest. Here's a look at what students are protesting and what it means for Milei's effort to transform crisis-prone Argentina into an economic success story. What do protesters want? Professors and non-teaching staff at public universities across Argentina are demanding a pay raise to compensate for sky-high inflation that they say has shrunk their purchasing power by 60% this year. After a student-led march mobilized a half-million protesters in April, Milei's government compensated universities for operational costs but not for teachers' salaries. The average salary of an associate professor is now $320 per month. For teaching assistants, it's just $120 a month. The university funding bill that Milei vetoed would have increased staff salaries to make up for 2024 annual inflation — which now tops 200% — and adjusted them for inflation going forward. Even if Milei's drastic measures have recently dragged month-on-month inflation below 5%, the number of Argentines in poverty has swelled to more than 50%. The public university system hasn't seen this kind of budget shortfall since 2004, according to the Civil Association for Equality and Justice, an Argentine nonprofit. 'Our living conditions have visibly worsened,' said Nicolas Jose Lavagnino, a researcher in the philosophy of biology at Conicet, Argentina's leading research body that reported losing 250 scientists this year due to budget cuts. Unions reject the government's 6.8% pay raise offer as inadequate. The University of Buenos Aires — one of Latin America's biggest and most prestigious — has warned of mass resignations over depreciating salaries. At least 30 teachers have quit at UBA's Faculty of Agriculture alone. Milei has vowed to block any measure that jeopardizes the budget balance. In September, he vetoed a bill raising pensions — which would have cost his government over 1% of Argentina's gross domestic product — for the same reason. But the education bill would have cost only 0.14% of GDP, stirring doubts over the economic significance of Milei's battle. 'We see this as a direct attack on the philosophy of public education in our country,' said Matias Busi, a 25-year-old student at Argentina's University of La Plata. What does Milei say? The irascible president has lambasted universities as leftist indoctrination camps. 'What productivity do scientists have?' he said in 2023 on the campaign trail, advocating for the defunding of research institute Conicet. While promising not to get rid of free public education, Milei demands that universities undergo a government audit and do more to clean up corruption. 'If they don't want to be audited, it must be because they are dirty,' he said. Milei's party in recent weeks has also revived an unpopular attempt to charge tuition for foreign non-residents, who make up nearly 4% of total enrollment. The public education system in Argentina is rare in that there are no bars to entry — foreigners who can't afford a bachelor's degree in their own countries can enroll free of charge at first-rate public universities like UBA, where all five of the country's Nobel Prize winners studied. Half of Milei's Cabinet even graduated from public universities. Some say Milei is justified in requesting more financial transparency, pointing to the alleged misuse of funds and creeping politicization of what was once a universally respected institution. 'There were contracts with public sector figures where absurd things were funded,' said Argentine political consultant Sergio Berensztein, referring to scandals that erupted during the tenure of former leftist President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner over big-budget research projects that audits later revealed had never existed. 'They were simply mechanisms to divert funds for political interests.' What is the political context? After Milei's government mustered just enough votes to prevent the opposition from overriding his veto of the university funding bill on October 10, over 250,000 Argentines — spanning the far-left to center-right — flooded the streets. The student-led movement drew a range of Argentine protesters stung by austerity that has deepened the recession and pushed poverty to its highest level in 20 years — retirees desperate for better pensions, doctors furious over meager pay, artists against closure of the national film institute, scientists angry over gutted funds, pilots worried about Milei's plans to privatize Argentina's flagship airline. Santiago Gándara, a social sciences professor at both UBA and the University of La Pampa, said he believed Milei miscalculated in going after Argentina's proud symbol of publicly financed education for the masses. 'It is like someone coming and saying, 'We are going to get rid of the Plaza de Mayo,'' he said, referring to the historic Buenos Aires square that filled with protesters last week. 'Milei understood this too late. … You can't decide the fate of Plaza de Mayo. It belongs to all of us.' The question of whether the demonstrations morph into a real threat for Milei remains open. 'I think these protests are not at the point of being life-threatening to Milei, but it's obviously damaging,' said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. 'When students mobilize, you really never know where that movement is going to end.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-public-universities-are-paralyzed-by-protests-here-s-why/7847199.html	2024-11-02T00:28:05-07:00	
South Carolina to build first monument to an African American	BEAUFORT, SOUTH CAROLINA — South Carolina is preparing to put up its first individual statue for an African American on its Statehouse lawn, honoring a man who put on Confederate clothes in order to steal a slaveholder's ship and sail his family and a dozen others to freedom during the Civil War. But Robert Smalls isn't just being honored for his audacious escape. He spent a decade in the U.S. House of Representatives, helped rewrite South Carolina's constitution to allow Black men equality after the Civil War and then put up a valiant but doomed fight when racists returned to power and eliminated nearly all of the gains Smalls fought for. U.S. Representative Jermaine Johnson can't wait to bring his children to the Statehouse to finally see someone who is Black like them being honored. 'The man has done so many great things, it's just a travesty he has not been honored until now. Heck, it's also a travesty there isn’t some big Hollywood movie out there about his life,' said Johnson, a Democrat from a district just a few miles from the Statehouse. The idea for a statue to Smalls has been percolating for years. But there was always quiet opposition preventing a bill from getting a hearing. That changed in 2024 as the proposal made it unanimously through the state House and Senate on the back of Republican Representative Brandon Cox of Goose Creek. 'South Carolina is a great state. We’ve got a lot of history, good and bad. This is our good history,' Cox said. What will the Robert Smalls memorial look like? The bill created a special committee that has until January 15 to come up with a design, a location on the Statehouse lawn and the money to pay for whatever memorial they choose. But supporters face a challenging question: What best honors Smalls? If it's just one statue, is it best to honor the steel-nerved ship pilot who waited for all the white crew to leave, then mimicked hand signals and whistle toots to get through Confederate checkpoints, while hoping Confederate soldiers didn't notice a Black man under the hat in the pale moonlight in May 1862? Or would a more fitting tribute to Smalls be to recognize the statesman who served in the South Carolina House and Senate and the U.S. House after the Civil War? Smalls bought his master's house in Beaufort in part with money made for turning the Confederate ship over to Union forces, then allowed the man's penniless wife to live there when she was widowed. Or is the elder Smalls who fought for education for all and to keep the gains African Americans made during the Civil War the man most worth publicly memorializing? Smalls would see a new constitution in 1895 wipe out African Americans' right to vote. He was fired from his federal customs collector job in 1913 when then President Woodrow Wilson purged many Black men out of government jobs. Or would it be best to combine them all in some way? That's how Republican Representative Chip Campsen, an occasional ship pilot himself, sees honoring one of his favorite South Carolinians. 'The best way to sum up Robert Smalls' life is it was a fight for freedom as a slave, as a pilot and as a statesman,' Campsen said. Location, location, location Then there is the matter of location. While South Carolina has a monument with multiple panels honoring the struggle of African Americans from their journey on slave ships through today, it doesn't honor an individual Black man or woman among the two dozen monuments scattered around the Statehouse. At least six different monuments honor people such as Dr. J. Marion Sims, who some consider the father of modern gynecology but who underpinned his research operating without anesthesia on enslaved women and girls. There are several honoring Confederates who fought to protect slavery in the state that started the Civil War and hangs a marble copy of the Articles of Secession in the lobby between its House and Senate chambers. The dubious list includes 'Pitchfork' Ben Tillman, a governor and U.S. senator who bragged about how he led groups of whites who killed Black men trying to vote during the election of 1876 which led to the end of Reconstruction, the return of all-white rule and the collapse of everything for which Smalls had worked. None of that is on the plaque for Tillman's statue. Some supporters have suggested Smalls' statue could stand nearby and be taller and more prominent than Tillman's to give Smalls a triumph some 130 years in the making. Once design and location are determined, organizers hope raising the money gets easier with a concept in mind. 'We have to get the narrative right,' Republican Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said. 'This is going to tell a story. I think it is important that we tell that the right way to honor him and to honor South Carolina. I think it’s really cool.' Robert Smalls' monumental life Robert Smalls was born in 1839 in Beaufort and died in 1915 in his hometown a free, but somewhat forgotten man who lived a life unimaginable to a woman holding her son born into slavery. Supporters now have a chance to make sure he never fades into obscurity. 'Robert Smalls writes a new future for this county that in the moment no one can see is happening,' said Chris Barr, the Chief of Interpretation for the Reconstruction Era National Historic Park in Beaufort as he stood beside a bust of Smalls near his grave in his hometown. Driving a Confederate boat to freedom is what captures the most attention in that remarkable life, Barr said. 'If you’re an enslaved person working on one of these boats around the Charleston Harbor like Robert Smalls, you’ve got the tools, you’ve got the talent, you’ve got the boat and you know how to drive it,' Barr said 'And you can literally see freedom floating in the form of the United States Navy just a few miles offshore. All you need is an opportunity.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-carolina-to-build-first-monument-to-an-african-american/7835734.html	2024-11-02T00:26:38-07:00	
World's largest captive crocodile dies in Australia	sydney — A 5.48-meter Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old. Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook. 'He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild croc,' according to a post by the organization, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns. 'Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever.' The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighboring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry. Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity. He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 meters long, according to Guinness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-largest-captive-crocodile-dies-in-australia/7848686.html	2024-11-02T00:17:02-07:00	
Lebanon searches for survivors after Israeli airstrikes kill 52	Rescuers in northeastern Lebanon searched for survivors Friday after Israeli airstrikes killed at least 52 people, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. Israel airstrikes pounded Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early Friday, sending families fleeing from their homes. Video from the scene showed some buildings in rubble as smoke rose above the skyline. Lebanon's Health Ministry said 72 people were injured in the bombardment. Israeli warplanes also destroyed dozens of buildings Friday in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, but there were no reports of causalities. The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, reported that seven people were killed in northern Israel by cross-border rocket attacks from Hezbollah. In statement posted to its X social media account, the IDF said during the night Thursday into Friday, its fighter jets 'attacked with precise intelligence' sites for weapons production, as well as what it said were Hezbollah central headquarters and other 'military infrastructures' in the Beirut area. The IDF said its fighter jets also attacked overnight what it described as Hezbollah's 'southern front' headquarters throughout Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon. They said advance warnings were given to the population in the area to mitigate the risk to civilians. Lebanon's state National News Agency, or NNA, reported Lebanon's acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, said Friday the overnight strikes and the 'expansion of Israeli aggression' in Lebanon show that Israel 'rejects all efforts' to reach a cease-fire. Earlier this week he had expressed hope for the possibility of such an agreement. In Gaza, doctors and local sources reported more than 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza overnight Thursday into Friday. Officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told The Washington Post that 26 bodies arrived at the hospital, including 21 from Nuseirat refugee camp. The leaders of 15 U.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations said Friday, 'the situation unfolding in northern Gaza is apocalyptic.' The officials, which included the heads of the World Health Organization, World Food Program and children's agency UNICEF said, 'The entire region is on the edge of a precipice' and said Palestinians have been denied basic humanitarian aid and lifesaving supplies. The IDF said in a statement its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. They also told the AP they had hit a Hamas infrastructure site and had targeted a militant who was operating in the Nuseirat area. The violence comes as U.S. diplomats, including U.S. CIA Director William Burns, left the region this week after a series of meetings to push for a cease-fire. A senior Hamas leader, Taher al-Nunu, told news outlets Friday that the militant group has rejected the latest short term cease-fire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar because it did not include a lasting cease-fire. At a news conference Friday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he remains optimistic regarding peace and cease-fire efforts on both fronts. Regarding Lebanon, Blinken said once again, the basis of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis would be the effective implementation of the 2006 U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its armed presence from an area south of the Litani River and for Israeli forces to get out of Lebanon. Blinken made the comments at a joint briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The two held talks Friday with their South Korean counterparts in Washington. Blinken was asked about a letter he and Austin sent to Israel, calling on Tel Aviv to take steps to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza or face possible restrictions on U.S. military aid. The secretary of state said their teams are tracking 'very carefully' Israel's response and efforts regarding humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Blinken said there has been 'progress' but added it has been insufficient. 'We're working on a daily basis to make sure that Israel does what it must do to ensure that this assistance gets to people who need it inside of Gaza,' Blinken said. 'It's not enough to get trucks to Gaza; it's vital that what they bring with them can get distributed effectively inside of Gaza.' Blinken also mentioned the World Health Organization's successful initial polio vaccination campaign for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. He said for that campaign to be concluded, there must be a second round of vaccinations completed quickly, and he called on Israel to facilitate that effort. The WHO said Friday the next phase of the polio vaccination campaign will begin Saturday after being postponed from October 23 due to a lack of access and a lack of humanitarian pauses in the fighting in Gaza. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,259 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, where the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people.

Russian political prisoner dies in Belarus penal colony, rights group says	A 22-year-old Russian man considered a political prisoner by activists has died in a penal colony in Belarus, human rights group Viasna said Friday. The rights group said it confirmed the death of Dmitry Shletgauer, who was recently transferred to a penal colony in Mogilev in eastern Belarus. Viasna said Shletgauer had been at the penal colony for a short time before his death. 'Provisionally, this happened on October 11,' the rights group said. 'He spent less than a month in the penal colony. The exact cause of death is unknown.' Shletgauer received a 12-year sentence after being convicted of espionage and facilitating extremist activities. He was arrested in the crackdown in Belarus that occurred after the disputed 2020 presidential election of Alexander Lukashenko that gave the strongman a sixth term. In September, Shletgauer joined Viasna's list of recognized political prisoners in Belarus. Belarus, a close ally of Russia, is reported to have approximately 1,300 political prisoners, according to Viasna. Radio Free Europe reports Shletgauer was born in Slavgorod, Russia, and acquired residency in Belarus in 2018. Some information for this story came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-political-prisoner-dies-in-belarus-penal-colony-rights-group-says/7848588.html	2024-11-01T17:55:23-07:00	
Niger disputes French firm's uranium move	Niamey, Niger — Niger's military junta is disputing a decision by French nuclear fuel firm Orano to halt uranium production, according to a document from a state partner in the venture seen Friday by Agence France-Presse. Orano announced last month that it was stopping production as of Thursday, owing to what it termed increasingly difficult operating conditions in the country and financial issues. Nigerien state company Sopamin is a shareholder with Orano, which holds a majority stake in Somair, the last site that the French group was still operating in the country prior to Thursday. The French lamented the withdrawal by the junta in June of a permit for one of the largest uranium deposits in the world, Imouraren, and the impossibility of exporting the raw material with Niger's border with Benin closed for what Niamey says are security reasons. 'Despite its status as a co-shareholder, Sopamin was not consulted on this serious decision' to halt production, the company, which has operated for half a century in the country's north, said in a document dated Thursday. The Nigerien firm complained that the decision 'lacks transparency' and 'violates a number of principles and practices essential to governance and commitments between stakeholders.' Orano said it had proposed an alternative to the Nigerien authorities, namely exporting the uranium to France or Namibia, and expressed regret that there was no reaction to the suggestion. Niger states in the document seen Friday a wish to 'purchase 210 tons of uranium through the natural channel of Sopamin,' which it said would 'allow Somair to continue its activities.' Currently, 1,050 tons of uranium concentrate from stocks from 2023 and 2024, or around half of the site's average annual production worth an estimated 300 million euros ($360 million), are currently blocked, Orano estimates. The ruling junta, which took power last year in a July coup, says it will revamp rules regulating the mining of raw materials by foreign companies in what is the world's seventh-largest uranium producer. It has also downgraded links with former colonial power France and strengthened ties with new partners including Russia and Iran. In September, Niger's Council of Ministers adopted a draft decree creating a state entity, 'Timersoi National Uranium Company,' abbreviated to TNUC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-disputes-french-firm-s-uranium-move-/7848381.html	2024-11-01T17:52:27-07:00	
UN chief 'appalled' at RSF attacks in Sudan's Al Jazirah state	united nations — The U.N. secretary-general on Friday strongly condemned recent attacks in Sudan's Al Jazirah state by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and reiterated his call for the war to end. 'The secretary-general is appalled by large numbers of civilians being killed, being detained or being displaced, as well as acts of sexual violence against women and girls, the looting of homes and the looting of markets and the burning of farms,' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 'Such acts may constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Perpetrators of such serious violations must be held to account.' From October 20 to 30, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out major attacks in villages across eastern Al Jazirah state, reportedly killing more than 120 civilians. The International Organization for Migration said Friday that more than 135,000 people have fled the area in the past week, with most going to Gedaref and Kassala states. The U.N. office for humanitarian affairs says it and its partners, especially local organizations and volunteers, are supporting thousands of the new arrivals with humanitarian aid, mental health support, family reunification services and other assistance. The RSF has been locked in battle with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for nearly 19 months, since their leaders turned against one another and engaged in a power struggle that has tipped the nation into catastrophe. Dujarric said the U.N. chief is alarmed that the humanitarian situation continues to worsen and 'demands' that all parties to the conflict facilitate 'safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to all civilians in need in Sudan.' Eleven million people have been displaced and half of Sudan's population, an estimated 25 million people, are struggling with crisis levels of food insecurity. Famine was confirmed in August in parts of Sudan's Darfur region. At least 14 other areas of Sudan are considered at risk of famine in the coming months. Meanwhile, diseases, including cholera, are spreading. 'The secretary-general renews his call for a cease-fire to spare Sudanese civilians from further harm,' Dujarric said. Security Council action Assistance has been slow to reach the Sudanese because of the fighting and lack of access to parts of the country. In August, the government reopened a critical border crossing from Chad that it had closed because it feared the RSF was using it to smuggle in arms and other war materiel. The Adre crossing reopened for an initial three-month period, which will expire on November 16. Humanitarians and diplomats have urged that it be permanently reopened. Britain assumed the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, and Ambassador Barbara Woodward told reporters that scaling up the humanitarian response is a priority for the U.K. 'Even since the Adre border opened in August, fewer than 30 trucks of aid are getting in per week, and that is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of 9 million people suffering in Darfur,' she said. She said use of the border crossing must be renewed and 'all possible routes' for aid – whether across borders or conflict front lines – must be maximized. 'If they're not, countless lives will be lost,' Woodward said. On Monday, Sudan's U.N. ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed, told Security Council members that his government had opened nine crossings in addition to Adre and seven airports for humanitarians. But he cautioned that his government needed to review every three months and consider the security risks of keeping Adre open. 'The border crossing at Adre is really a threat to national security,' Mohamed said. Britain's Woodward said her delegation would convene a meeting on Sudan on November 12 to be chaired by the U.K.'s minister for the United Nations and Africa, Lord Collins of Highbury, to focus on the protection of civilians and the scaling up of aid. She said Britain, which leads the negotiating and drafting of resolutions on Sudan, would soon circulate a draft resolution to Security Council members. 'The draft resolution will be based on the secretary-general's recommendations and will focus on developing a compliance mechanism for the warring parties' commitments they made on the protection of civilians in Jeddah over a year ago, in 2023, and ways to support mediation efforts to deliver a cease-fire, even if we start with local cease-fires before moving to a national one,' she said. Just weeks after the fighting erupted, the SAF and RSF signed a declaration in Saudi Arabia reaffirming their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid for them, including precautions to avoid and minimize civilian harm, which both sides have failed to do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appalled-at-rsf-attacks-in-sudan-s-al-jazirah-state-/7848385.html	2024-11-01T17:05:22-07:00	
Brazil police indict 20 in connection with salt mine catastrophe	SAO PAULO — Brazil's federal police indicted 20 people Friday for rock salt mining in the northeastern coastal city of Maceio that destroyed five urban neighborhoods and forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes. The alleged crimes include damage to public property and environmental crimes. A police source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to The Associated Press that those indicted were employees or contractors of Braskem, one of the biggest petrochemical companies in the Americas. Braskem is owned primarily by Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras and construction giant Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht. It operated the mining of rock salt in the area for four decades and has been under investigation since the neighborhoods began collapsing in 2018. In a statement to The Associated Press, Braskem said it had not yet reviewed the full police report and therefore would not comment on the individuals indicted who were connected to the company. The petrochemical firm stated that it has cooperated with the investigation and 'has always acted in compliance with industry laws and regulations, regularly informing and reporting to the competent authorities.' Rock salt mining is a process of extracting salt from deep underground deposits. However, brine-filled cavities left behind when the salt has been extracted can eventually collapse, causing the soil above to settle. Structures built on top of such areas can topple. Around 200,000 people in the Alagoas state capital Maceio were affected by the excessive extraction of rock salt, according to the Brazil Senate's website. In July 2023, Braskem announced a $356-million settlement with the city. The money would be used for structural works in the city and for a residents' support fund. In December, a closed rock salt mine partially collapsed. The area had been previously evacuated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-police-indict-20-in-connection-with-salt-mine-catastrophe-/7848359.html	2024-11-01T17:03:42-07:00	
Bolivia's Arce says Morales' backers behind takeover of military posts	la paz, bolivia — Bolivian President Luis Arce accused followers of his former mentor-turned-rival, Evo Morales, of being behind an armed takeover of military posts and holding soldiers hostage on Friday, ramping up tensions in the already restive Andean nation. Arce said the groups had forced their way into three military posts outside the central Bolivian city of Cochabamba, home to many supporters of ex-President Morales, after shooting at and launching dynamite at police. The groups have also broken into each post's armory, Arce said, calling the act 'criminal' and accusing the attackers of treason. Bolivia's military urged those responsible for the takeover to 'immediately and peacefully' abandon each post. Morales, in a press conference later on Friday, called for a dialogue with the government. Without taking responsibility for the assault on the military posts, Morales said he would launch a hunger strike until talks between the two sides began. 'The lives of my instructors and soldiers are in danger,' warned an unnamed military official in a recording broadcast on local media. Televised images showed a row of uniformed soldiers with their hands behind their backs, possibly tied, surrounded by members of the armed group. Arce urged solidarity, saying that many of the soldiers were working class and Indigenous, much like their captors. Earlier this week, police and military had attempted to clear a weeks-long highway blockade by Morales' supporters strangling traffic between Cochabamba and Oruro. Protesters retaliated by launching dynamite at them from nearby hills, with police then launching tear gas. Morales' followers set up road blockades in mid-October in support of him, pressuring for a criminal investigation into the former president for alleged abuse of a minor to be dropped. Morales has argued the investigation is politically motivated. Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the impoverished South American economy more than $1.7 billion, Arce said on Wednesday. The two leftist leaders, both with roots in Bolivia's ruling socialist party, have gone from close allies to bitter rivals in recent months as they jockey for position ahead of next year's presidential election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-s-arce-says-morales-backers-behind-takeover-of-military-posts-/7848388.html	2024-11-01T16:47:50-07:00	
Pentagon sends bomber aircraft, warships to Middle East	washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is sending additional bomber aircraft and Navy warships to the Middle East to bolster the U.S. presence in the region as an aircraft carrier and its warships are preparing to leave, U.S. officials said Friday. Austin ordered several B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft, tanker aircraft and Navy destroyers to deploy to the Middle East, according to four U.S. and military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements. The military moves come as Israel's wars with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon rage, including a retaliatory strike on Iran a week ago that likely damaged a base that builds ballistic missiles and launches rockets as part of Tehran's space program. The U.S. is pressing for cease-fires, while repeatedly saying it will defend Israel and continue to protect the American and allied presence in the region, including from Yemen-based Houthi attacks against ships in the Red Sea. The long-range nuclear-capable B-52 bomber has been repeatedly deployed to the Middle East in pointed warnings to Iran and it is the second time this month that strategic U.S. bombers will be used to bolster U.S. defenses in the region. In October, B-2 stealth bombers were used to strike underground Houthi targets in Yemen. Officials did not provide the number of aircraft and ships that will move into the region. The shifts are likely to result in an overall decrease in the total number of U.S. service members in the region, largely because an aircraft carrier contains as many as 5,000 sailors. But the addition of bomber aircraft beefs up U.S. combat strength. There have been as many as 43,000 U.S. forces in the region recently. According to a U.S. official, the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and the three Navy destroyers in its strike group are scheduled to leave the Middle East by midmonth and return to their home port in San Diego. When it departs, there will be no aircraft carrier in the Middle East for a period of time, the official said. Officials declined to say how long that gap would last. Military commanders have long argued that the presence of an aircraft carrier strike group, with its array of fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and heavily armed warships, is a significant deterrent, including against Iran. To make up for that gap, Austin is ordering the deployment of other Navy destroyers to the region. Those destroyers, which are capable of shooting down ballistic missiles, would come either from the Indo-Pacific region or Europe, the official said. Eventually, it is expected that the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and its three warships will move to the Mediterranean Sea, but they won't get there before the Lincoln departs. The Truman strike group has been in the North Sea, participating in a NATO military exercise. The Lincoln and two of its destroyers are now in the Gulf of Oman, and its third destroyer is with two other warships in the Red Sea. There are also two destroyers and the Marine amphibious ready group — which includes three ships — in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-sends-bomber-aircraft-warships-to-middle-east/7848373.html	2024-11-01T16:27:24-07:00	
29 Nigerian children could face death penalty for protesting cost of living	ABUJA, Nigeria — Twenty-nine children could be facing the death penalty in Nigeria after they were arraigned Friday for participating in a protest of the country's record cost-of-living crisis. Four of them collapsed in court due to exhaustion before they could enter a plea. A total of 76 protesters were charged with 10 felony counts, including treason, destruction of property, public disturbance and mutiny, according to the charge sheet seen by The Associated Press. According to the charge sheet, the minors ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to several mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds more were arrested at a protest demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people. The death sentence was introduced in the 1970s in Nigeria, but there have been no executions in the country since 2016. Akintayo Balogun, a private lawyer based in Abuja, said the Child Rights Act does not allow any child to be subject to criminal proceedings and sentenced to death. 'So, taking minors before a federal high court is wrong ... except if the government is able to prove that the boys are all above 19 years,' Balogun said. The court eventually granted $5,900 bail to each of the defendants and imposed stringent conditions they are yet to meet, Marshal Abubakar, counsel to some of the boys, said. 'A country that has a duty to educate its children will decide to punish those children. These children have been in detention for 90 days without food,' Abubakar said. Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough, a civil society organization promoting good governance in Nigeria, said authorities have no business prosecuting children. 'The chief justice of Nigeria should be ashamed, she is a woman and a mother,' Adamolekun said. Despite being one of the top crude oil producers in Africa, Nigeria remains one of the world's poorest countries. Chronic corruption means the lifestyle of its public officials rarely mirrors that of the general population. Medical professionals often strike to protest meager wages. The country's politicians and lawmakers, often accused of corruption, are some of the best paid in Africa. Even the president's wife — her office is nowhere in the constitution — is entitled to SUVs and other luxuries funded by taxpayers. Nigeria's population of over 210 million people — the continent's largest — is also among the hungriest in the world and its government has struggled to create jobs. The inflation rate is also at a 28-year high, and the local naira currency is at record lows against the dollar. On Thursday, Nigeria was classified as a 'hotspot of very high concern,' in a report from United Nations' food agencies, as large numbers of people are facing or are projected to face critical levels of acute food insecurity in the West African country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-children-could-face-death-penalty-for-protesting-cost-of-living-/7848325.html	2024-11-01T16:18:45-07:00	
New York subway chokehold death trial begins	A New York prosecutor told jurors on Friday that the way veteran Daniel Penny defused an uncomfortable situation on the subway by using a chokehold 'went way too far.' Prosecutor Dafna Yoran said Penny, a white Marine veteran, continued to hold his arm around the neck of Jordan Neely, a homeless Black man who had been acting erratically, after Neely's body went limp. When the train stopped at a station, one rider told Penny, 'If you don't let him go now, you're going to kill him,' Yoran told the jury in her opening statement Friday. Penny has been charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has pleaded not guilty, saying he was acting in self-defense. 'Deadly physical force is permitted only when it's absolutely necessary and only for as long as it's absolutely necessary,' Yoran said. Penny 'went quite literally for the jugular,' she added. The deadly encounter happened more than one year ago and received wide news coverage at the time, with some people casting Penny as a hero and others casting Neely as a victim of a vigilante. Neely, whom Yoran said was homeless and suffering with mental illness, entered the subway train on May 1, 2023, threw his coat to the ground and told the riders he was hungry, thirsty and wanted to return to jail. His erratic behavior is something that New Yorkers can witness daily. 'His voice was loud and his words were threatening,' Yoran said, but Neely was also unarmed and did not physically threaten any of the riders. Thirty seconds after Neely entered the train, the prosecutor said, Penny placed Neely in a chokehold. Yoran said Penny held Neely in the chokehold for about six minutes. Video of the incident, Yoran said, would show 'how unnecessary this deadly chokehold was.' There is cellphone video of the incident, recorded from the subway platform. The prosecutor also said that Penny, who has first aid training, did not try to revive Neeley. Penny later told police, 'I put him out' and said that he was trying to 'de-escalate' the scene on the subway. According to The Associated Press, Neeley was a Michael Jackson impersonator who sometimes performed his act for subway riders. His mental illness and drug abuse, AP said, was likely triggered by his mother's murder when he was a teenager. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-subway-chokehold-death-trial-begins/7848310.html	2024-11-01T16:08:33-07:00	
Hindus seek protection from attacks in Muslim-majority Bangladesh	DHAKA, Bangladesh — Tens of thousands of minority Hindus rallied Friday to demand that the interim government in Muslim-majority Bangladesh protect them from a wave of attacks and harassment and drop sedition cases against Hindu community leaders. About 30,000 Hindus demonstrated at a major intersection in the southeastern city of Chattogram, demanding their rights while police and soldiers guarded the area. Other protests were reported elsewhere in the country. Hindu groups say thousands of attacks against Hindus have happened since early August, when the secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was overthrown and Hasina fled the country following a student-led uprising. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate named to lead an interim government after Hasina's downfall, says those figures have been exaggerated. Hindus make up about 8% of the country's nearly 170 million people, while Muslims constitute about 91%. The influential Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has said that there have been more than 2,000 attacks on Hindus since August 4, as the interim government has struggled to restore order. U.N. human rights officials and other rights groups have expressed concern about human rights in the country under Yunus. Hindus and other minority communities say the interim government hasn't adequately protected them and that hard-line Islamists have become increasingly influential since Hasina's ouster. Concern from Modi The issue has reached beyond Bangladesh, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi voicing concern about reports of attacks. While the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden says it has been monitoring Bangladesh’s human rights issues since Hasina’s ouster, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has condemned what he described as 'barbaric' violence against Hindus, Christians and other minorities in Bangladesh. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: 'I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos.' Hindu activists have been staging protest rallies in the capital, Dhaka, and elsewhere since August to press a set of eight demands, including a law to protect minorities, a ministry for minorities and a tribunal to prosecute acts of oppression against minorities. They also seek a five-day holiday for their largest festival, the Durga Puja. Friday's protest in Chattogram was hastily organized after sedition charges were filed Wednesday against 19 Hindu leaders, including prominent priest Chandan Kumar Dhar, over an October 25 rally in that city. Police arrested two of the leaders, angering Hindus. The charges stem from an incident in which a group of rallygoers allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag on a pillar, which was considered disrespectful to the national flag. Hindu community leaders say the cases are politically motivated and demanded Thursday that they be withdrawn within 72 hours. Another Hindu rally has been planned for Saturday in Dhaka. Separately, supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and its allied Jatiya Party have said they also have been targeted since Hasina's ouster. Jatiya's headquarters was vandalized and set on fire late Thursday. On Friday, Jatiya Party Chairman G.M. Quader said his supporters would continue to hold rallies to demand their rights despite risking their lives. He said they would hold a rally Saturday at the party headquarters in Dhaka to protest price hikes of commodities, and what they call false charges against their leaders and activists. Later Friday, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police announced it was banning any rallies near the Jatiya headquarters. There was no immediate response from the party about whether it would press ahead with its attempts to hold the rally or change the venue. The police decision came after a student group strongly criticized the police administration for initially granting permission for the rally and then threatened to block it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hindus-seek-protection-from-attacks-in-muslim-majority-bangladesh/7848357.html	2024-11-01T16:07:51-07:00	
COVID-19 shots banned at public health district in Idaho, likely first in US	A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccinations to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board. Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 shots. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department. While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID-19 vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright. 'I'm not aware of anything else like this,' said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on 'a judgment of the medical product itself.' The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines in the health district has declined — with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10. On Oct. 22, the health department's board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban — despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity. 'Our request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those [vaccines], recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,' Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. 'This is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.' Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID-19 vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells 'contagion emergency kits' that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine — drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects. Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures. Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but 'disappointed' in the board's decision. He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors — and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments. Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they're safe and have saved millions of lives.) The people getting vaccinated at the health department — including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process — had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said. 'I've been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you're ... trying to get by and get ahead,' Aberasturi said. 'This is where we should be stepping in and helping. 'But we have some board members who have never been there, so they don't understand what it's like.' State health officials have said that they 'recommend that people consider the COVID-19 vaccine.' Idaho health department spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment on 'public health district business,' but noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health centers for people who are uninsured. Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the 'health and well-being' of the district's residents. 'But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/covid-19-shots-banned-at-public-health-district-in-idaho-likely-first-in-us-/7848342.html	2024-11-01T15:49:00-07:00	
No war to access sea, says Ethiopia prime minister	As the dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over sea access escalates, Ethiopia's prime minister on Thursday said his country was seeking access to the Red Sea 'through peaceful means.' Speaking at the parliament where he was questioned by lawmakers, Abiy Ahmed said Ethiopia has a 'clear stance' on the issue. 'Let the world hear today, Ethiopia maintains a clear national interest — it needs Red Sea access through peaceful means,' he said. 'If we do not succeed, our children will,' Abiy added. Somalia and Ethiopia have been involved in a heated diplomatic dispute since Addis Ababa in January signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the self-proclaimed independent republic of Somaliland, a move Somalia sees as infringing on its sovereignty. Ethiopia and Somaliland defended the MOU which, if implemented, would give Somaliland recognition from landlocked Ethiopia in return for the leasing of about 20 kilometers of seafront, according to Somaliland officials. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said Somalia faced a 'serious threat' from Ethiopia for signing a sea access deal with Somaliland. Barre said Somali ports have always been accessible for Ethiopia's legitimate commercial activities but alleged that Ethiopia has other motives. 'Ethiopia's attempts to annex parts of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access are both unlawful and unnecessary,' Barre said. Barre warned that Ethiopia's approach and deal with Somaliland could 'embolden secessionist movements.' Abiy on Thursday denied any interest in annexation. 'When we signed the MOU with Somaliland, we requested a 99-year lease, but they didn't agree, and we signed a 50-year lease agreement,' he said. 'How can a 50-year lease be an annexation?' Abiy asked. Abiy told MPs that Ethiopia did not have any agenda in Somalia other than access to the sea. 'Ethiopia is a country which has the second-largest Somali population in the world next to Somalia. They are our brothers,' he said. Ethiopia has several thousand troops in Somalia helping its government in its struggle against Islamist extremists. Somalia on Tuesday expelled an Ethiopian diplomat, accusing him of engaging in 'activities incompatible with his diplomatic role.' Somalia did not specify the actions allegedly committed by Ali Mohamed Adan, a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, but said in a statement that they 'constitute a breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.' Abiy did not comment on the expulsion of the diplomat during the session at Parliament.

Before US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charge in Hong Kong	When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme to violate sanctions. A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida. He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the United States. Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida real estate. Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app. According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington. American charges After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of microelectronics to Russia. The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions. It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and Estonia. 'As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal activity,' U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release. 'Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the plot.' The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export restrictions. Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company Radius Avtomatika. Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA. It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s military-industrial complex. Hong Kong story Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea — and their three children. Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions, some of this activity became illegal. When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK Limited. All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited. Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple screens. Just a day after Postovoy's arrest was announced, Cubios publicly denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited. 'Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or employees ... have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,' the company said in a statement on its website. The startup also said that Postovoy 'falsely listed himself as a VP of the Company' on LinkedIn. In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for production, according to archived versions of its website. Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced him to Postovoy. 'I was looking for someone who could help with production in China — they gave me Denis,' he wrote in a message to VOA. According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube. Later the company decreased cooperation with him. Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed him to call himself the vice president of production 'for business purposes,' Osipov told VOA. He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’ permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said. Coming to America In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where Cubios' headquarters is. According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly strict Chinese control of Hong Kong. American prosecutors see a different motivation. In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022, with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to $643,000. According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before. Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. By June 2022, Postovoy's wife purchased a house in southeastern Sarasota. Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost. In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost $1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by his wife. On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and later sold the property. According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy's decision to transfer the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his ownership. He 'did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his financial affidavit submitted to this Court,' the judge wrote in a decision not to grant Postovoy bail. This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company.

Recent US strikes spotlight growing Islamic State threat in Syria	WASHINGTON — Airstrikes carried out by the U.S. military this week against several Islamic State targets in Syria highlight concerns about the terror group's growing presence in the war-torn country, experts say. U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, said Wednesday that its forces had conducted strikes on Monday targeting multiple camps belonging to IS, or ISIS, in the Syrian desert. Nearly 35 IS operatives, including senior leaders, were killed in the airstrikes, the U.S. military said. Despite its territorial defeat in 2019, IS has been carrying out attacks through sleeper cells across Iraq and Syria. In recent months, militants affiliated with the group have increasingly become active in areas controlled by forces loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad and their Iranian and Russian allies. The Syrian Desert, also known as the Badia, where the U.S. forces struck IS positions this week, has seen a significant surge in violence by IS militants in recent months. IS had maintained training camps in the Syrian desert for many years, according to Gregory Waters, a research analyst at the Counter Extremism Project who closely follows IS activities in central Syria. 'These are the places where it trains the next generation of fighters — often children it recruits from northeast Syria — and where adult fighters can return to in between their operations,' Waters told VOA. 'While the central Syrian desert is under Russian and Syrian regime control, ISIS does not abide by these arbitrary lines.' He added that IS cells in the central desert support the cells operating in northeast Syria, which is largely under the control of U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The United States has about 900 troops in northeast Syria as part of a global coalition against IS. 'Oftentimes the fighters will cross from one region to the other to either conduct attacks or to escape from counter-ISIS operations,' Waters said. Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, said the U.S. strikes demonstrate that the terror group remains a significant threat in Syria. 'Moreover, the Assad regime lacks either the will or the capability to counter ISIS, so the United States has remained vigilant in its efforts to keep the group on the defensive,' he told VOA. 'Any time you have a terrorist group with the legacy of the Islamic State, with a proven track record of being able to recruit, plan and conduct attacks, including external operations in the West, it is never a good idea to become complacent,' Clarke said. 'The strikes are necessary to keep ISIS from regrouping, whether in Syria or the hinterlands of Afghanistan.' Abdul Wahab Assi, a researcher at the Istanbul-based Jusoor Center for Studies, said the U.S. strikes in the Syrian Desert carried a political message, as well. 'It sent a message to Russia, which ostensibly operates against IS in that particular area, that it's not doing enough' to counter IS activities in Syria, he told Syria TV, a news channel affiliated with the Syrian opposition. Last week, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced the killing of the IS leader in Iraq and eight other senior IS commanders in a joint operation by U.S. and Iraqi forces. CENTCOM said in its Wednesday statement that alongside its allies and partners in the region, it 'will continue to aggressively degrade ISIS operational capabilities to ensure its enduring defeat.'

Mideast-North Africa region sees surge in global investment despite conflicts	For the first time in years, the Middle East and North African region is seeing a surge in interest from international investors. Major companies like Google, Microsoft and Adobe recently took part in one of the largest technology events in the region when Dubai hosted Expand North Star 2024, which attracted over 6,500 exhibiting companies, 1,800 startups and 1,200 investors from 180 countries. Over the last year, more than half of all investors in regional startups have come from outside, reflecting how attractive the Middle East and North Africa, or MENA, have become for those seeking new areas for growth, including investors from the U.S., Europe and beyond. Farah el Nahlawi, a United Arab Emirates-based research team leader at venture data platform MAGNiTT, provided hard numbers on the surge of international investment in the MENA region. 'In the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a total of 390 investors in the MENA region, with 199 of them being international investors,' Nahlawi said. 'When we break down these international investors, we see a diverse mix of contributors: 37% from the USA, 13% from the U.K. and 8% from Singapore.' Financial technology According to a recent report from MAGNiTT, the financial technology sector emerged as a key driver, securing $480 million in funding. At the heart of this trend is the desire for many countries in the region, like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, to move beyond traditional resource-based industries like oil, Nahlawi, said. They’re investing heavily in technology, education and innovation, creating fertile ground for startups and entrepreneurs. Nahlawi pointed to significant government initiatives across the region. 'Programs such as Saudi Vision 2030 and the UAE's economic policies have been pivotal in attracting international capital,' she said. 'These initiatives have notably improved the investment climate through economic diversification, aimed at reducing reliance on oil,' she added. 'By promoting sectors like tourism, technology and renewable energy, these governments are making their economies more resilient and appealing to investors seeking long-term stability.' Willingness to do business in the region has drawn criticism from some venture capitalists who spoke on background to publications like Financial Times, calling the investments a 'Faustian bargain' with governments and monarchs accused of human rights violations. Saudi Arabia's alleged killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, CNBC reported in September, 'remains an issue for some Western partners and startups.' The Post reported in May that 'some tech executives and security researchers' remain wary about those abuses, along with the possibility that some countries in the region could 'use American technologies for surveillance — including to target U.S. citizens.' But for many international investors, the MENA region offers the chance to enter a fast-growing market with high returns. For local governments, it’s a way to secure long-term growth beyond oil. Sergii Malomuzh, founder of Rewump — a business incubator for next-generation web startups — said regional governments are adopting progressive and flexible regulatory approaches to support emerging technologies and industries. 'This supports innovation and creates a favorable business climate for foreign investments,' he told VOA. Malomuzh also said markets like the UAE remain attractive because of their high growth potential and stable economic policies. 'From my experience investing in and working with the MENA region, I’ve noticed that investors come from various places, including the U.S., Europe, and the Gulf.' Talent in Sudan Yousif Yahya, co-founder of Sudan’s Savannah Innovation Labs, a prominent incubator and consultancy firm, emphasized Sudan’s unique position within the MENA investment landscape. Although much of Sudan’s young, talented and mobile workforce has been displaced by war, Yahya told VOA that some victims were fortunate enough to find opportunities outside Sudan, sometimes filling skills gaps and contributing to cross-border innovation. Yahya also noted that a surge in international interest is partly driven by countries like Egypt, where comprehensive policy reforms have been enacted to attract and protect foreign investments. These measures, he argued, reflect a commitment across the region to build a stable, predictable and investor-friendly environment. Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, highlighted the region’s potential for entrepreneurial growth despite conflicts in several countries. 'Countries in the MENA region boast young and growing populations and contain many promising startup scenes,' he told VOA. Mogielnicki pointed out that many MENA governments, particularly in the Gulf, are actively investing in entrepreneurship. 'In some cases, government entities provide direct support and investments to startups. In other instances, governments are seeking to enhance the startup and entrepreneurial ecosystems through supportive policies.' However, he cautioned, wars and geopolitical tensions could impact startups differently. 'The implications for startups and their ability to secure investments depend greatly on the industry they operate within, the potential for disruptions to operations, and fluctuating levels of available investment capital,' Mogielnicki said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mideast-north-africa-region-sees-surge-in-global-investment-despite-conflicts-/7848223.html	2024-11-01T13:59:46-07:00	
Elon Musk loses bid to move $1 million voter prizes case	A U.S. judge on Friday denied Elon Musk's bid to move a Pennsylvania lawsuit over his $1 million voter prizes to federal court, moving the case back to state court. It was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the billionaire's plan to keep awarding money until the U.S. presidential election Tuesday. The decision was issued by U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in Philadelphia federal court. Musk has been giving $1 million checks to randomly selected registered voters who sign a petition supporting free speech and gun rights. Musk's America PAC had awarded $1 million prizes to 14 people as of Friday and said the final prize will be given out Tuesday. Democratic Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner sued Musk and his political action committee, which backs Republican former President Donald Trump, on Monday in a state court to try to block the giveaway. Krasner called the program an illegal lottery. Two days later, Tesla CEO Musk and his America PAC sought to move the case to federal court, arguing Krasner's lawsuit raised questions about free-speech rights and election interference that belong in federal court. That prompted the state judge who had been overseeing the case to put it on hold. In arguing that the case belonged in state court, Krasner called Musk's maneuver an attempt to 'run the clock until Election Day.' Krasner did not allege the giveaway violates federal law. Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania, one of seven battleground states likely to determine the outcome of the race between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musk's offer is limited to registered voters in the seven states expected to decide the election — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Musk gave away the first $1 million at an October 19 America PAC rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's state capital. The giveaway falls in a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided on whether Musk could be violating federal laws against paying people to register to vote. The U.S. Department of Justice warned America PAC the giveaway could violate federal law, according to media reports, but federal prosecutors have not taken any public action. Musk has so far given nearly $120 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-loses-bid-to-move-1-million-voter-prizes-case/7848193.html	2024-11-01T13:11:19-07:00	
WHO says more than 50,000 vaccinated against mpox in DR Congo, Rwanda	geneva — More than 50,000 people have so far been vaccinated against mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, the World Health Organization's chief said on Friday. The outbreak is still not under control, the African Union's health watchdog warned a day earlier, appealing for resources to avoid a 'more severe' pandemic than Covid-19. More than 1,100 people have died of mpox in Africa, where some 48,000 cases have been recorded since January, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The majority of deaths have been in the DRC, the epicenter of the outbreak, which launched a vaccination drive last month. 'So far, more than 50,000 people have been vaccinated against mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, thanks to donations from the United States and the European Commission,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. He also said that nearly 900,000 vaccine doses had this week been allocated to nine countries under a mechanism set up by the WHO and its partners. The countries in question were to be informed on Friday, he added. 'This is the first allocation of almost six million vaccine doses that we expect to be available by the end of 2024' through the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM), the WHO chief said. Mpox, previously known as monkeypox, is caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals that can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. Related to smallpox, the viral disease causes fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that forms into blisters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-more-than-50-000-vaccinated-against-mpox-in-dr-congo-rwanda/7848165.html	2024-11-01T12:43:54-07:00	
Erdogan sues opposition chief, Istanbul mayor for slander	istanbul — Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday sued the main opposition leader and Istanbul's powerful mayor over allegedly slanderous remarks made at a protest rally a day earlier, the Anadolu news agency reported. Filed on Friday, the two separate lawsuits targeted Ozgur Ozel, head of the Republican People's Party (CHP), and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, also a top party official. One accused Ozel of 'publicly insulting the president' and 'clearly committing a crime against the reputation and honor of the office of the presidency.' The second suit alleged Imamoglu had made 'unfounded accusations including slander, that violated Erdogan's rights' and had 'acted with the aim of humiliating the president in front of the public.' Each lawsuit sought 1 million Turkish lira ($30,000) in damages from the accused. The legal action centers on remarks the pair allegedly made Thursday at a demonstration in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt a day after police arrested its opposition mayor for alleged links to the banned Kurdish PKK militant group. It was not immediately clear which remarks prompted the legal action, but Ozel, who took over as CHP leader just a year ago, quickly hit back. Erdogan 'pretends to have been insulted without any insult being made, and tries to make himself the victim ... as if it was not he who insulted and victimized Esenyurt' by arresting its mayor, he told reporters. Imamoglu, who was elected as Istanbul mayor in 2019, is often portrayed as Erdogan's biggest political rival and is widely expected to run in the 2028 presidential race. He is seen as one of Turkey's most popular politicians. Two years ago, Imamoglu was sued for defamation after describing Istanbul election officials as 'idiots' during the 2019 Istanbul mayoral election. A court found him guilty, sentenced him to nearly three years in jail and barred him from politics for the duration of the sentence, prompting an international outcry. Imamoglu has appealed while continuing to serve as mayor. At the time, Erdogan insisted the case had nothing to do with him. The 70-year-old Turkish leader launched his own political career in the 1990s by being elected as mayor of Istanbul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/erdogan-sues-opposition-chief-istanbul-mayor-for-slander/7848167.html	2024-11-01T12:43:19-07:00	
What US election results could mean for Africa	JOHANNESBURG — Whoever U.S. voters choose as their next president — former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris — the election has global implications, with the probability it will affect other economies, foreign conflicts and personal freedoms, analysts told VOA. South African independent political analyst Asanda Ngoasheng said the winner could usher in policies that affect ordinary people in Africa. 'I hope that as Americans vote, they’re aware that whatever decision they make, it’s going to determine the future of not only America but the rest of the world,' she said. 'How we engage with issues of termination of pregnancy, how we engage with issues of LGBT rights, how we engage with issues of race and racism will be determined by this election, not just for America but for everyone else and everywhere else in the world,' Ngoasheng continued. The abortion issue is a particularly divisive topic for U.S. Republicans and Democrats. While the United States is the largest funder of global reproductive health programs, Trump slashed that funding during his presidency by extending a policy that barred U.S. aid from going to any organization that supported abortion. Experts said they believe that a second Trump presidency would likely do that again and could negatively affect PEPFAR, the U.S.’s key HIV/AIDS program. Trade is another key area in which analysts think Harris and Trump would differ, given Trump’s 'America first' policy. African governments hope that next year the U.S. will renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a Clinton-era policy that gives countries duty-free access to the U.S. market. Ray Hartley, research director of South African Brenthurst Foundation think tank, does not have high hopes for a second Trump presidency. 'I think that a Trump presidency would reinforce America’s isolationist approach in international affairs, and that might not be good for trade,' he said. Other analysts said they believe general U.S. policy toward Africa won’t differ radically regardless of who wins. They said that while Africa was often neglected in terms of U.S. foreign policy, that has shifted in recent years amid renewed competition with Russia and China on the resource-rich continent. Moscow has strengthened military ties with many African governments, while U.S. troops have been kicked out of Niger and Chad. Beijing, meanwhile, is Africa’s largest trade partner and has been building infrastructure throughout the continent. Ebenezer Obadare, senior fellow for Africa studies at U.S. research organization Council on Foreign Relations, said, 'Insofar as the United States is intent on competing with those powers in Africa, keeping its old alliances and building new ones, I don’t think one administration is likely to differ much from another, strictly in terms of their Africa policy.' As vice president, Harris traveled to the continent, where she pushed President Joe Biden’s line that the U.S. was 'all in on Africa.' The Biden administration also started holding an annual U.S.-African leaders’ summit. And, as it increases competition with China, the current administration has also undertaken funding the biggest U.S. infrastructure project in Africa in generations: the Lobito corridor, a railway connecting Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo that will be used to transport critical minerals. Biden was forced to reschedule a promised visit to Africa and is now expected in Angola in December. The choice of country has been criticized by some for what they say is Angola's shoddy human rights record. Trump's signature initiative involving the continent was creating Prosper Africa, a U.S. agency designed to assist American companies doing business in Africa. However, he also offended many Africans during his first term, using a derogatory term to refer to countries on the continent and mispronouncing Namibia’s name. More recently he raised ire by comparing himself to South African icon Nelson Mandela. Analysts said that while Harris and Trump have generally ignored Africa over the course of their campaigns, whoever becomes America's next president would do well to keep up engagement with the continent, which boasts the world's youngest population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-us-election-results-could-mean-for-africa/7848065.html	2024-11-01T12:11:49-07:00	
Trump to visit Dearborn, Michigan, 'capital' of Arab America	WASHINGTON — In the run up to the presidential election, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has increased its outreach to Arab and Muslim Americans, particularly in battleground state Michigan. But it is her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, who has made surprising gains with this group that makes up a significant portion of voters angry over President Joe Biden’s policies on the Gaza war. On Friday, Trump is expected to visit a halal cafe in Dearborn, Michigan, a city dubbed the Arab capital of America, in a state home to almost 400,000 Arab Americans. Many of them have expressed determination to punish Harris over the Biden administration’s support for Israel. Trump’s visit is a continuation of his outreach to the Arab and Muslim community that have borne him important endorsements from leaders of two nearby Michigan cities that, while tiny, carry symbolic importance. Bill Bazzi, the first Muslim and Arab American mayor of Dearborn Heights, and Amer Ghalib, the Yemeni American mayor of Hamtramck, the only U.S. city with an all-Muslim city council, have endorsed the Republican candidate. 'My meeting with President Trump was positive, and we hope that he can change the current situation,' Ghalib told VOA. 'He said he doesn't want wars, and he will listen to our concerns.' Three of the six members of the Hamtramck City Council followed Ghalib’s endorsement and the rest endorsed Harris — a split that reflects the community’s polarized views of the candidates. 'Harris has answered this question many times that she is going to work with Gaza. She’s going to be fair with people of Gaza,' council member Mohammed Alsomiri told VOA. 'Trump, I don't believe him, and I don't trust him.' The former president has been intensively courting the group. At a rally last week in the Detroit suburb of Novi, about a half-hour drive from Dearborn, he said Muslim and Arab voters 'want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That's all they want.' Trump was joined onstage by what his campaign described as 'prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,' including Imam Belal Alzuhairi of the Great Mosque of Hamtramck. 'We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war!' said Alzuhairi. This despite Trump suggesting that he would give Israel’s military offensives against Hamas and Hezbollah more leeway, telling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recent call to, 'Do what you have to do.' He often boasts he will end the wars in the Middle East 'in 24 hours,' without explaining how. As president, in 2017 Trump called for a 'total and complete shutdown' on Muslims, banning individuals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering, a policy that activists say is 'cruel, inhumane, and violated international law.' The Trump campaign has not responded to VOA’s queries on outreach to the community. Harris' outreach On the first anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, 25 Muslim leaders released an open letter telling Muslim voters that backing Harris 'far outweighs the harms of the other options.' The Harris campaign said it is 'working hard' to engage the community. The vice president met twice with a small group of leaders in Michigan, in Detroit in August shortly after she became the Democratic nominee and in Flint in early October. She has had one other meeting since then, with Black imams and community leaders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, another key swing state. Afghan American Nasrina Bargzie and Egyptian American Brenda Abdelal, two lawyers spearheading Muslim and Arab outreach for the Harris campaign, have met with groups in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Minnesota, Arizona and Nevada, the Harris campaign told VOA. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually in early October with leaders across the country, the campaign said. But many of these meetings have been with friendlier groups, suggesting that they were not aimed at changing hearts and minds. Gordon’s meeting excluded major Muslim and Arab organizations as well as pro-Palestinian activist groups and was more of a 'check the box' engagement, according to James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, who participated in the eight-person meeting. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris’ vice presidential pick, has had one engagement with Arab and Muslim Americans, an October virtual meeting with Engage Action, the political arm of an 18-year-old Muslim American advocacy group, which already endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate in September. Third-party candidates While polls suggest that support among Arab American and Muslim Americans for Trump is unlikely to surpass Harris’, they also show that third-party candidates could pull a significant portion of votes away from her. In Michigan, Green Party candidate Jill Stein has been campaigning on a platform to 'end the genocide.' A poll released Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy organization, showed that 29.4% of American Muslims plan to vote for Harris, 29.1% for Stein, and 11.2% for Trump. Some 16.5% remain undecided. The numbers suggest an improvement for Harris and Trump among the group. Before Biden’s withdrawal, CAIR’s poll showed Biden received 7.3% support and Trump 4.9%. Compared to Biden, Harris has been more vocal in expressing sympathy for Palestinians and calling out Israel to 'follow humanitarian law.' She has also addressed the suffering in Lebanon and announced $157 million in assistance from the administration. At a Harris rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this week, Assad Turfe, an Arab American official from nearby Wayne County, said that Harris is a leader 'who will give voice to our pain.' But as in her various campaign events, in that rally Harris was heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters. 'Hey guys, I hear you,' she said. 'We all want this war to end as soon as possible.' A candidate must secure a minimum of 270 out of 538 Electoral College votes to win. With 16 Electoral College votes, Michigan could tip the balance in what is expected to be a very close election. Biden won the state in 2020 with 154,000 votes more than Trump. In 2016, Trump won the state over Hillary Clinton by just under 11,000 votes. The Gaza war has been a divisive issue among the community. At a Dearborn press conference announcing Arab American leaders’ endorsement for Harris last week, a group of anti-Harris Arab Americans confronted them, calling them traitors. Ronald Stockton, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan-Dearborn who has studied the community for decades, said he has never seen such polarization. He fears the community may be torn apart for good, regardless of who wins. 'There will be permanent scars left behind,' Stockton told VOA, 'like battlefield scars that remain decades after the war ends.' VOA's Iram Abbasi contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-visit-dearborn-michigan-capital-of-arab-america/7847953.html	2024-11-01T11:31:10-07:00	
What's at stake in Moldova's weekend run-off election?	Moldova's Constitutional Court on Thursday validated the results of last month's referendum, formally recognizing the country's decision to join the European Union. The 'yes' result, however, was an incredibly close one, much closer than polls had predicted, and the road toward EU membership for Moldova is not expected to be smooth either. Supporters of the measure attribute the much closer than expected result to Russian meddling in the run-up to the vote held on October 20, together with the presidential election. Both campaigns were marred by massive Russian disinformation and an alleged vote-buying scheme said to have cost the Kremlin tens of millions of dollars. Some have described an atmosphere of bitterness and division with unprecedented mud-slinging and 'hate speech,' including ethnic slurs and fascist tropes, leaving the country, some would say, dangerously divided. The top two presidential candidates, incumbent pro-Europe President Maia Sandu and pro-Kremlin former prosecutor general Alexandr Stoianoglo, face a run-off vote on Sunday. 'I hope that the pro-European forces, that Maia Sandu will win elections, but I am worried that this victory will be achieved with a small margin,' Ludmila Barba, host of Moldovan program The European Vector, told VOA. 'That was the case with the referendum. And this state of affairs means that this antagonism in society will remain.' Moldova is a parliamentary republic and those elections will take place next year. Right now, the government is controlled by Sandu's PAS party, but some predict it could lose control next year. Analysts expect Moldova will remain a battleground for hearts, minds and political allegiances for some time to come and Moscow is no doubt poised to further exploit divisions. It has been throwing its weight around Moldova since the collapse of the USSR but has been honing its meddling technique since last year's local elections. 'It was like a bootcamp for them [the Kremlin] for interference and then they scaled it,' Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London's Chatham House, told VOA. 'They've seen what worked and that was vote-buying, trying to put eggs in different baskets … but underneath it all, having influence, having them on the payroll of Russia.' The most audacious part of the scheme was the participation of fugitive Russia-based oligarch Ilan Shor, who was convicted in 2017 of banking fraud in Moldova. He is accused of buying off a network of up to 300,000 Moldovans, paying them to vote against Europe in last month's referendum. 'They have been paid for their activity, from the equivalent of 50 euros a month and up. It's not big money, but when you take into account the complicated economic and social situation in Moldova, for people with a low income, these 50 euros are important,' Barba said. President Sandu called out the scheme but was unable to stop it. Moldovan runoff follows Georgia election Moldova's runoff comes on the heels of a hotly disputed victory for Georgia's pro-Russian Georgian Dream party. Georgia's opposition-aligned president, Salome Zourabichvili, declared the results illegitimate, describing a 'Russian Special Operation' to undermine the vote and she is fighting back, at this point, with uncertain effect. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE]) has noted voter intimidation, ballot stuffing and bribery in Georgia, but Moscow claims its hands are clean. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, the showing by the pro-Russian party is a dramatic turn for a country that had full-blown war with Russia in 2008. 'I would never have imagined Russia or a Russian agenda having such a strong comeback in Georgia. There was for a while so much open hatred toward Russia, that anything suspected to be related to Russia would immediately be rejected,' Lutsevych said. 'This is where Russians are smart in how they play the subversion game. They are not openly saying this is a Russian agenda.' The recent passage in Georgia of a 'Foreign Agent' law, an act clearly inspired by Moscow, got the EU to pause further discussion about bringing Georgia into the bloc. And the conduct of last week's elections was to be another 'litmus test' for Brussels on Tbilisi's readiness to join. While there may be clever, forward-thinking manipulation on the part of Moscow, Barba says one cannot ignore the effect of the immediate raw rage coming from the Kremlin. 'This is the first election since the Russian aggression in Ukraine began. The situation is more complicated because Russia is furious that it didn't manage to take Ukraine in three days and that makes it more aggressive,' she says. 'Since it was not able to clinch victory in Ukraine, it is going after smaller ones in Georgia and Moldova to prove or assert its status.' For the people of Moldova, fear has become the main theme of the elections. Barba points out that the pro-Russian side has said that if Moldova stays close to Russia, 'the country will be safe. That Ukraine has war because they went toward the EU.' 'That narrative is going around. And thepro-Europeans say if we end up with Russia, we will have war, we will be dragged in. Both sides are trying to say that the other option could lead to war.' According to Lutsevych, fear can ultimately drown out Sandu's main message that Moldova can have a brighter future with Europe. And this is taking its toll on some young members of Sandu's team. 'They don't feel it's a fair game. They don't feel they can win against that. It's so powerful. It's hard to compete when someone like Russia fuels anger, fear, and you have to compete on a positive agenda.' Still, getting into Europe is a fight in itself and Lutsevych praises Sandu for taking up that fight. And the nature of this election campaign, she concludes, has put Moldova more front and center on Europe's agenda and perhaps put enhanced focus on what Russia is doing on the sidelines of the Ukraine war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-at-stake-in-moldova-s-weekend-run-off-election-/7847965.html	2024-11-01T10:34:28-07:00	
Before US sanctions violations arrest, Russian businessman faced charges in Hong Kong	When the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on three companies belonging to Denis Postovoy on Wednesday, it was yet another move to break up what U.S. authorities say was an international scheme to violate sanctions. A month earlier, on September 16, law enforcement officials arrested the 44-year-old Russian national in Sarasota, Florida. He was charged with conspiring to violate sanctions on Russia, commit smuggling, commit money laundering and defraud the United States. According to the indictment, Postovoy used an international network of companies to export dual-use microelectronic components from the United States to Russia –– potentially spare parts for military drones used in the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. Postovoy is not the first Russian charged with violating U.S. export controls. But he is one of the few who allegedly did it from inside the United States. Using court documents and open-source information, VOA pieced together Postovoy’s history, revealing a story involving international trade, criminal charges in two countries, a U.S. startup and Florida real estate. Postovoy pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Postovoy is in pretrial detention and could not be reached for comment. His lawyer did not respond to a VOA request for comment. When VOA reached Postovoy’s wife by phone, she hung up. She did not respond to questions sent to her on the WhatsApp messenger app. According to the latest court filings, Postovoy’s case was transferred to the U.S. District Court in Washington. American charges After Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the U.S. significantly expanded restrictions on the export of microelectronics to Russia. The Department of Justice has accused Postovoy and several unnamed co-conspirators of using a network of companies under their control in Hong Kong, Switzerland and Russia to violate those sanctions. It claims Postovoy misrepresented the buyers and destinations of the goods, routing them through Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey and Estonia. 'As alleged, he lied about the final destination for the technology he was shipping and used intermediary destinations to mask this illegal activity,' U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves stated in a press release. 'Fortunately, our skilled law enforcement partners at HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] and our dedicated attorneys unraveled the plot.' The prosecution states that Postovoy’s clients included the Russian company Streloi Ekommerts and other unnamed firms. According to the indictment, the contract with Streloi was completed before the company was added to the U.S. sanctions list in December 2023. An investigation by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty found that Streloi actively helps Russia circumvent Western export restrictions. Another recipient of the microelectronics, according to an invoice included in the case materials, was the Russian technology company Radius Avtomatika. Neither company responded to emailed questions from VOA. It is unclear whether the microelectronics Postovoy allegedly exported were ultimately used in drones, but one court document states that the people he contacted were members of Russia’s military-industrial complex. Hong Kong story Originally from Novosibirsk, Russia, Postovoy had lived in Hong Kong since at least 2010 with his wife — a Ukrainian citizen from Crimea — and their three children. Shipping records indicate his companies were involved in exporting goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, to Russia. Prosecutors allege that after the U.S. expanded its sanctions, some of this activity became illegal. When the DOJ announced Postovoy’s arrest, it also listed the names of his companies that it said were involved in the alleged scheme. Aside from the Russian-registered firm Vektor Group, all the others were in Hong Kong: Jove HK Limited, JST Group Hong Kong and WowCube HK Limited. All are now under U.S. sanctions, except for WowCube HK Limited. Its appearance in the indictment provoked a rapid response from Cubios, another company previously associated with Postovoy. It produces the WOWCube gaming console, wich looks like a Rubik’s cube with multiple screens. Just a day after Postovoy's arrest was announced, Cubios publicly denied any connection to WowCube HK Limited. 'Neither Cubios nor any of its officers, directors, managers or employees ... have any connection to the HK Entity whatsoever. We do not own, operate or are in any way affiliated with the HK Entity,' the company said in a statement on its website. The startup also said that Postovoy 'falsely listed himself as a VP of the Company' on LinkedIn. In fact, Postovoy was previously Cubios’ vice president for production, according to archived versions of its website. Ilya Osipov, CEO of Cubios, told VOA that a mutual friend introduced him to Postovoy. 'I was looking for someone who could help with production in China — they gave me Denis,' he wrote in a message to VOA. According to Osipov, Postovoy became a business partner and made important contributions to prototypes and test batches of the WOWCube. Later the company decreased cooperation with him. Although Postovoy did not have an official position, Cubios allowed him to call himself the vice president of production 'for business purposes,' Osipov told VOA. He claimed that Postovoy founded the Hong Kong firm without Cubios’ permission. It was planned to become a distributor of the consoles in Asia, but that never happened, Osipov said. Coming to America In 2022, Postovoy and his family moved to Sarasota, Florida, where Cubios' headquarters is. According to Osipov, Postovoy said the move was motivated by a desire to raise children in a Western country and concerns about increasingly strict Chinese control of Hong Kong. American prosecutors see a different motivation. In a response to U.S. federal investigators included in the case materials, Hong Kong police said Postovoy was charged on March 1, 2022, with money laundering — a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to $643,000. According to the email, Postovoy was scheduled to appear in court on March 4 but left Hong Kong the day before. Hong Kong police did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. By June 2022, Postovoy's wife purchased a house in southeastern Sarasota. Sarasota County property records indicate the house was valued at around $980,000. A mortgage covered $680,000 of the cost. In August 2023, Postovoy bought another house, in the new Rivo Lakes gated community in Sarasota. According to purchase documents, it cost $1.13 million. In September, he transferred it to a trust controlled by his wife. On the same day, his wife transferred the house to another trust and later sold the property. According to a U.S. magistrate judge, Postovoy's decision to transfer the second house into a trust was likely an attempt to conceal his ownership. He 'did not list his home — which is valued at nearly a million dollars and held in the name of a trust controlled by his wife — on his financial affidavit submitted to this Court,' the judge wrote in a decision not to grant Postovoy bail. This may not be the only attempted cover-up in the case: Russian company records indicate that, in December 2023, a man named Dmitry Smirnov replaced Postovoy as owner of his Vektor Group company. VOA’s Cantonese Service contributed research to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/before-us-sanctions-violations-arrest-russian-businessman-faced-charges-in-hong-kong/7847881.html	2024-11-01T09:57:39-07:00	
US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum restrictions	U.S. border authorities apprehended some 54,000 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary figures obtained by Reuters, showing a marginal rise from September but continuing the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate Donald Trump over illegal immigration as the two compete in a tight race. Immigration is a top issue for voters heading into Tuesday's election, particularly among Republicans, and Trump has intensified his language. The roughly 54,000 migrant arrests from October 1 through October 30 were far less than the U.S. Border Patrol's monthly arrest average of 160,000 through the first eight months of fiscal year 2024, before the Biden restrictions were imposed. The preliminary data reviewed by Reuters did not include the final day of October. In fiscal year 2023, border agents apprehended an average of 170,000 migrants per month. In fiscal year 2019, before the pandemic and during Trump's presidency, the monthly average was about 71,000. 'We feel very confident in the strategy that we're employing to manage this,' a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said, requesting anonymity to discuss unpublished statistics. The official said the reduced crossings had allowed more agents to move to the field and target trafficking of people and drugs. Biden's restrictions blocked most people crossing illegally from claiming asylum. At the same time, Mexico stepped up its immigration enforcement following U.S. pressure. Trump cracked down on both legal and illegal immigration during his 2017-2021 presidency and has promised historic levels of deportations if reelected. Harris blames Trump for helping kill bipartisan legislation earlier this year that aimed to increase border security. The Biden administration has also launched programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally through emergency 'parole,' which Biden officials say has reduced illegal crossings. Republicans argue the Biden programs exceed the bounds of the law and serve as a workaround to allow migrants to enter the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-border-arrests-remained-lower-in-october-amid-biden-asylum-restrictions/7847826.html	2024-11-01T09:16:37-07:00	
Eight die in Serbian railway station roof collapse	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Eight people were killed and two hospitalized on Friday when the roof of a railway station in the Serbian town of Novi Sad collapsed, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said in a televised statement. Local television stations showed emergency services at the scene, including medical staff who were preparing stretchers nearby. Two large diggers for removing rubble were also stationed in front of the station. 'It is an extremely difficult rescue operation that will last for several more hours. We have around 80 rescuers from several towns working and heavy machinery,' Dacic said, adding that two more people were still under the rubble but were alive. Local media said potentially dozens of people were injured. The mayor's office in the city acknowledged the incident but did not say how many were hurt. N1 news channel said that train departures were halted from the station about 70 kilometers northwest of the capital, Belgrade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eight-die-in-serbian-railway-station-roof-collapse/7847824.html	2024-11-01T09:15:24-07:00	
Spanish floods' death toll climbs to 205; shock turns to anger, frustration	CHIVA, SPAIN — The death toll from historic flash floods in Spain climbed to least 205 people Friday, with many more believed to be missing, as the initial shock gave way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity. Spanish emergency authorities said 202 of the victims were in the Valencia region, and officials warned that more rain was expected in the next days. The damage from the storm Tuesday and Wednesday recalled the aftermath of a tsunami, with survivors left to pick up the pieces as they mourned loved ones lost in Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Many streets were still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still don’t have electricity, running water or stable telephone connections. 'The situation is unbelievable. It’s a disaster and there is very little help,' said Emilio Cuartero, a resident of Masanasa, on the outskirts of Valencia. 'We need machinery, cranes, so that the sites can be accessed. We need a lot of help. And bread and water.' In Chiva, residents were busy Friday clearing debris from mud-filled streets. The Valencian town received more rain in eight hours on Tuesday than it had in the preceding 20 months, and water overflowed a gully that crosses the town, tearing up roads and walls of houses. Mayor Amparo Fort told RNE radio, 'Entire houses have disappeared. We don’t know if there were people inside or not.' So far 205 bodies have been recovered — 202 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. 'I have been there all my life, all my memories are there, my parents lived there ... and now in one night it is all gone,' Chiva resident Juan Vicente Perez told The Associated Press near the place he lost his home. 'If we had waited five more minutes, we would not be here in this world.' Before-and-after satellite images of the city of Valencia illustrated the scale of the catastrophe, showing the transformation of the Mediterranean metropolis into a landscape inundated with muddy waters. The V-33 highway was completely covered in the brown of a thick layer of mud. The tragedy has unleashed a wave of local solidarity. Residents in communities such as Paiporta — where at least 62 people died — and Catarroja have been walking kilometers in sticky mud to Valencia to get supplies, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing water, essential products and shovels or brooms to help remove the mud. The number of people coming to help is so high that the authorities have asked them not to drive there because they block the roads needed by the emergency services. In addition to the contributions of volunteers, associations such as the Red Cross and town councils are distributing food. And as authorities repeat over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona and Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. The storm cut power and water services on Tuesday night, but about 85% of 155,000 affected customers had their power back on by Friday, the utility said in a statement. 'This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don’t have medicine. There are children who don’t have food. We don’t have milk, we don’t have water. We have no access to anything,' a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. 'No one even came to warn us on the first day.' Juan Ramon Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, said the aid isn't nearly enough for residents trapped in an 'extreme situation.' 'There are people living with corpses at home. It’s very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,' he told reporters. 'We go with vans to Valencia, we buy, and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.' Rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable. Some shops have been looted, and the authorities have arrested 50 people. Social networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it. Others organized collections of basic goods throughout the country or launched fundraisers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spanish-floods-death-toll-climbs-to-205-shock-turns-to-anger-frustration/7847799.html	2024-11-01T09:10:44-07:00	
Hungary’s Orban says Georgia’s election was fair despite EU criticism	US and EU officials are calling for an investigation into recent elections in Georgia that resulted in the Pro-Russian Georgian Dream party winning a fourth term as the country’s ruling party. But that didn’t stop Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban from congratulating the party during a visit to the Georgian capital Tbilisi.

US employers add 12,000 jobs last month as hurricanes, strikes reduce payrolls	WASHINGTON — America’s employers added 12,000 jobs in October, a total that economists say was held down by the effects of strikes and hurricanes that left many workers temporarily off payrolls. The report provided a somewhat blurry view of the job market at the end of a presidential race that has pivoted heavily on voters’ feelings about the economy. Last month’s hiring gain was down significantly from the 223,000 jobs that were added in September. But economists have estimated that hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with strikes at Boeing and elsewhere, had the effect of pushing down net job growth by tens of thousands of jobs in October. Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate remained at 4.1% last month. The low jobless rate suggests that the labor market is still fundamentally healthy, if not as robust as it was early this year. Combined with an inflation rate that has tumbled from its 2022 peak to near prepandemic levels, the overall economy appears to be on solid footing on the eve of Election Day. The government did not estimate how many jobs were likely removed temporarily from payrolls last month. But economists have said they think the storms and strikes caused up to 100,000 jobs to be dropped. Reflecting the impact of the strikes, factories shed 46,000 positions in October. Health care companies added 52,000 jobs in October, and state and local governments tacked on 39,000. The employment report for October also revised down the government's estimate of the job gains in August and September by a combined 112,000, indicating that the labor market wasn't quite as robust then as initially thought. 'The big one-off shocks that struck the economy in October make it impossible to know whether the job market was changing direction in the month,’’ Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a commentary. 'But the downward revisions to job growth through September show it was cooling before these shocks struck.’’ Still, economists have noted that the United States has the strongest of the world’s most advanced economies, one that has proved surprisingly durable despite the pressure of high interest rates. This week, for example, the government estimated that the economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% annual rate last quarter, with consumer spending — the heart of the economy — helping drive growth. Yet as voters choose between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, large numbers of Americans have said they are unhappy with the state of the economy. Despite the plummeting of inflation, many people are exasperated by high prices, which surged during the recovery from the pandemic recession and remain about 20% higher on average than they were before inflation began accelerating in early 2021. With inflation having significantly cooled, the Fed is set to cut its benchmark interest rate next week for a second time and likely again in December. The Fed’s 11 rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 managed to help slow inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. A series of Fed rate cuts should lead, over time, to lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. In the meantime, there have been signs of a slowdown in the job market. This week, the Labor Department reported that employers posted 7.4 million job openings in September. Although that is still more than employers posted on the eve of the 2020 pandemic, it amounted to the fewest openings since January 2021. And 3.1 million Americans quit their jobs in September, the fewest in more than four years. A drop in quits tends to indicate that more workers are losing confidence in their ability to land a better job elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-employers-add-12-000-jobs-last-month-as-hurricanes-strikes-reduce-payrolls/7847691.html	2024-11-01T07:44:13-07:00	
Ethiopian students find success despite years of hardship	First, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that halted education in the Tigray region, and then, a deadly war, claiming many lives and displacing hundreds of thousands. Tenth-graders Yonas Nugus and Helen Berhe escaped with their families when their school in the town of Maychew was closed due to the war. Education was the last thing on their minds at the time, but they said they did not give up hope. 'The situation seemed hopeless and never-ending. It was tough to overcome, but we managed to get through it,' said Yonas, who like Helen recently completed a national exam and qualified to go on to university. The Tigray conflict flared up in November 2020 following a dispute between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray regional administration led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, or the TPLF party, which previously ruled the country. The United Nations and other institutions estimate that 600,000 civilians died in Tigray and more than 2 million were displaced from November 2020 to August 2022. In addition to the death and displacement, some women and girls were subjected to rape, as recorded by human rights agencies. 'During the war, a smart student with us committed suicide when they entered her area and raped her,' Helen said. 'When I heard stories like that, I wasn’t sure that something like that could happen to me tomorrow. It was not the time you could come in peacefully for school. So, even if I was going to die, I believed I would die fighting for my freedom.' For Yonas and Helen, both 17 at the time, the war had halted their dreams, but it did not kill those dreams; it just delayed them. In November 2022, the government and TPLF rebels concluded a cessation of hostilities agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. As the recovery from war began, school restarted, and the survivors came out of hiding and returned to Kallamino school in Maychew. The students from Tigray whose education had been disrupted were provided with special teaching materials and teachers to make up for the lost time. 'When we returned, our school lay in ruins. Our belongings left behind due to the COVID-19 pandemic were strewn about,' Helen said. 'Before the war, it took us a year to complete a class in school. However, we had to finish a year's education in just four months after the war. Then, we had to take the test. It was a very irregular learning process.' For Helen, the past has been challenging, filled with fear and anxiety. She has forgotten much of what she was taught before the war and faces a new language barrier because the instruction is now in English. But she also said the war taught her a different kind of lesson. 'It taught me to find purpose in life,' she said, attributing her success to this experience. 'I convinced myself that the past three years had been wasted and I needed to work hard for the future. I learned from the difficult times that I must walk with purpose. So, with the help of our friends, we finished our two-year course quickly,' Helen said. In the latest national exam results in Ethiopia, only 5.4% of high school students passed the university entrance exam, according to Minister of Education Birhanu Nega. Of the 674,823 students who took part in the entrance exam in the last academic year (2022-2023), only 36,409 obtained the average required to be admitted to university. That figure was an improvement compared with the previous year, when only 3.3% passed the exam. Yonas recorded the highest score of all those taking the test, scoring 675 out of 700 points. Helen scored highest among female students, getting 662 points out of 700. Yonas and Helen will now pursue higher education at the University of Mekelle, the region’s capital, or in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. Yonas has chosen to study computer science; Helen plans to study medicine, specializing in neurology. Schools halted in Amhara region As Tigray starts recovering from war, students in another part of Ethiopia face an uncertain future as schools were shut by a new conflict between government forces and Fano rebels. In the town of Bahirdar, capital of Amhara region, parents did not send their children to school for a week after explosions shook the city earlier this month. Two students and a teacher were injured in an explosion on October 4, said Mulualem Abe, the head of the city's Education Department. Days earlier, two teachers were killed in Sinan district of East Gojam zone in Ethiopia's Amhara region after being shot by gunmen, authorities said. In a statement posted on its Facebook page, the local administration said the teachers were preparing to start their teaching work for the current school year, which started in late September. Without naming a particular group, the statement accused armed groups 'who swear in the name of the Amhara people' of being behind the killing. A spokesperson for the Fano rebel group denied involvement in the killing of the teachers but indicated they are against the reopening of schools. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service. Aster Misganaw contributed to the report from Addis Ababa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopian-students-find-success-despite-years-of-hardship/7847177.html	2024-11-01T07:25:43-07:00	
US envoy sees some 'concerning signals' in Russia-China military cooperation in Arctic	The United States is watching growing cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic closely and some of their recent military collaboration in the region sends 'concerning signals', the U.S. Arctic ambassador said. Russia and China have stepped up military cooperation in the Arctic while deepening overall ties in recent years that include China supplying Moscow with dual-use goods despite Western sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine. Russia and the United States are among eight countries with territory in the resource-rich Arctic. China calls itself a 'near-Arctic' state and wants to create a 'Polar Silk Road' in the Arctic, a new shipping route as the polar ice sheet recedes with rising temperatures. Michael Sfraga, the United States' first ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, said the 'frequency and the complexity' of recent military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing in the region sent 'concerning signals'. 'The fact that they are working together in the Arctic has our attention,' Sfraga, who was sworn in last month, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Alaska. 'We are being both vigilant and diligent about this. We're watching very closely this evolution of their activity.' 'It raises our radar, literally and figuratively,' he added. Sfraga cited a joint run by Russian and Chinese bomber planes off the coast of Alaska in July, and Chinese and Russian coast guard ships sailing together through the Bering Strait in October. He said these activities had been conducted in international waters, in line with international law, but the fact that the bombers flew off the coast of Alaska had raised concerns for U.S. security. 'We do need to think about security, heighten our own alliances, our own mutual defences,' Sfraga said. 'Alaska, the North American Arctic, is NATO's western flank and so we need to think about the Arctic that way.' The activity was also a concern for U.S. allies as the Bering Strait and the Bering Sea give access to the North Pacific and South Pacific, he said. The Pentagon said in a report released in July that the growing alignment between Russia and China in the Arctic was 'a concern'. China and Russia are trying to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions. Beijing is seeking an alternative shipping route to reduce its dependence on the Strait of Malacca. The Arctic also holds fossil fuels and minerals beneath the land and the seabed that could become more accessible with global warming.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-sees-some-concerning-signals-in-russia-china-military-cooperation-in-arctic/7847586.html	2024-11-01T06:16:31-07:00	
Japan, EU announce new defense pact	TOKYO — Japan and the European Union announced a sweeping new security and defense partnership in Tokyo on Friday. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell hailed it as a historic and 'very timely' step. Borrell and his Japanese counterpart, Takeshi Iwaya, unveiled the pact to develop cooperation on joint military drills, the exchange of information related to the defense industry and space security, among other matters. 'I am extremely pleased to be here with Minister Iwaya to announce the conclusion of this security and defense partnership between the European Union and Japan,' Borrell said. He called it the 'the first agreement of this nature' the EU has made with an Asia-Pacific country, describing it as 'historical and very timely.' 'We live in a very dangerous world' and 'given the situation in both of our regions, this political framework deepens our ability to tackle emerging threats together,' Borrell told reporters. He did not mention China, but Japan has previously called its neighbor its greatest security challenge as Beijing builds up military capacity in the region. After the Tokyo talks, Borrell heads to South Korea, where concerns about North Korea will top the agenda. The United States has said thousands of North Korean troops are in Russia readying to fight in Ukraine. Pyongyang also test-fired one of its newest and most powerful missiles on Thursday, demonstrating its threat to the US mainland days ahead of elections. Defense industries The text of the EU-Japan Security and Defense Partnership, seen by Agence France-Presse, said they would promote 'concrete naval cooperation,' including through activities such as joint exercises and port calls, which could also include 'mutually designated third countries.' It also said the EU and Japan would discuss 'the development of respective defense initiatives including exchange of information on defense industry-related matters.' Japan, which for decades has relied on the United States for military hardware, is also developing a new fighter jet with EU member Italy and Britain that is set to be airborne by 2035. The agreement on industrial cooperation could 'turbo-charge collaboration, such that joint defense projects between Japanese and European firms funded through EU mechanisms may be on the cards,' analyst Yee Kuang Heng of the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy told AFP. Japan is ramping up defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP by 2027, partly to counter China, which is increasing military pressure on Taiwan. Beijing claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring it under its control. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who could head a minority government after a disastrous general election last week, has said that 'today's Ukraine could be tomorrow's East Asia.' Ishiba has also called for the creation of a NATO-like regional alliance with its tenet of collective security, although he has conceded this will 'not happen overnight.' The same warning was issued by Ishiba's predecessor, Fumio Kishida, who was hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden for a state visit in April at which the allies announced plans to boost their defense partnership. On Friday, Borrell and Iwaya also 'exchanged an instrument of ratification for Japan EU Strategic Partnership Agreement, or SPA,' Iwaya said, referring to a separate, previously agreed-upon pact. 'This SPA will formally enter into force on January 1 next year. It will be a legal foundation to strengthen the Japan-EU strategic partnership into the future,' Iwaya said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-eu-announce-new-defense-pact/7847578.html	2024-11-01T06:15:09-07:00	
Is China a hero or villain in the climate fight?	Berlin — China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases that cause global warming — but the country is also the global leader in developing sources of so-called green technology, such as solar and wind power. So, is China it a problem or a solution in the climate fight? As the climate conference COP29 draws near in Baku, Azerbaijan, China’s seemingly contradictory position in the climate fight has come into focus. More than 80% of China’s energy is produced using fossil fuels, with a heavy reliance on coal. The country’s coal production broke a record last year, and more coal-fired plants are being built. Despite that, China’s carbon emissions will likely peak in 2025, five years ahead of its target in 2030, according to the projection of Yiyun Cui, associate research professor and acting director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland. 'This is mainly driven by the very fast development of green technologies, particularly solar and wind. We’re seeing EV deployment very fast. [It’s] also driven by declining demand for a lot of energy intensive products like construction materials because of economic slowdown and restructuring,' said Cui. The latest report from the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Finland-based research and policy organization, showed that in the third quarter of this year, China’s coal emissions rose, but was offset by a reduction in emissions caused by steel, cement and oil production, a result of China’s slowing economy. Meanwhile, China is the global leader in building renewable energy capacity. The amount of energy supplied by the wind and solar power plants it’s building, when they come online, is expected to double the rest of the world combined, enough to power the whole of South Korea. For the past few years, Beijing has pushed a series of national policies, including allocating land to build wind plants and boosting the use of rooftop solar panels. These policies have stimulated China’s green economy and it is in Beijing’s interest to export green technology, Lauri Myllyvirta, senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA News. 'There’s a lot of enthusiasm from local governments, state banks, private investors for solar and wind projects, because they are profitable especially after the real estate market contraction. All of these players were looking for new targets for investment and sources of growth,' said Myllyvirta. China’s solar industry, for instance, is experiencing oversupply, which threatens to keep equipment prices low for years to come. While countries like the United States warned of threats to local production, Cui said this pulls down the cost for global energy transition, especially for countries in the so-called Global South. Countries are due to submit new climate plans early next year to reach the Paris Agreement Goal aimed at limiting the global temperature rise. As the world’s largest emitter, China’s commitment is expected to be 'absolutely crucial for the global climate effort,' said Myllyvirta. COP29 is set to take place from November 11th to 22nd in Azerbaijan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-china-a-hero-or-villain-in-the-climate-fight-/7847472.html	2024-11-01T04:51:32-07:00	
Kenya’s new deputy president sworn in	Nairobi — Kithure Kindiki was sworn in as Kenya’s deputy president Friday, less than 24 hours after a court lifted orders blocking his nomination to replace impeached DP Rigathi Gachagua, who has filed lawsuits to regain his position. In a televised ceremony at Nairobi's Kenyatta International Convention Center, Kindiki said he will always serve his country and will not let down President William Ruto, who appointed him. Ruto told attendees he knows his former interior minister as 'a dedicated professional,' and 'a patriot whose dedication to cohesion, national unity and inclusivity is beyond reproach.' Kindiki has been part of Ruto's cabinet for two years and came under fire for supporting alleged police brutality during anti-government protests earlier this year. He also faced criticism when Kenya decided to send police forces to Haiti, a deployment he and his boss vehemently defended. The swearing in ceremony took place 24 hours after a court lifted orders blocking Kindiki’s nomination, dealing a blow to former DP Gachagua, who was impeached and removed from office in mid-October amid accusations of gross misconduct and undermining the president. Gachagua's lawyers filed about 30 court cases arguing against the decision in the last two weeks. A three-judge bench appointed to hear the case made the highly anticipated announcement Thursday. 'Public interest in this matter favors giving way to the constitution, which in any event is the will of the people,' said Judge Antony Mrima, who heard the case along with Eric Ogola and Freda Mugambi. 'We choose to abide by that calling, as such public interest demands that the office of the deputy president should not remain vacant.' President Ruto took less than a day to nominate Kindiki, after Gachagua’s removal from office. The selection was approved by lawmakers in the National Assembly a few hours later. However, the court suspended any further action until it could hear the case. Since then, the three-judge bench has faced questions and petitions from Gachagua's lawyers contesting the validity of their appointment and their own impartiality. Those challenges were rejected. Gachagua was convicted on five of 11 charges against him, which included accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth and undermining the president. Gachagua has denied all the charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-new-deputy-president-sworn-in-/7847463.html	2024-11-01T04:36:13-07:00

Moscow says it destroyed 83 Ukrainian drones	Russia's Defense Ministry said its defenses shot down 83 Ukrainian drones over six regions early on November 1. '36 drones were shot down over the Kursk region, 20 over the Bryansk region, 12 over Crimea, eight over the Voronezh region, four over the Oryol region, and three over the Belgorod region,' the ministry said in a statement on its Telegram channel. Separately, Aleksandr Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk, said one person was wounded when a Ukrainian drone crashed into an apartment building in the city of Bryansk. In the Stavropol region, a drone fell on an oil depot in the city of Svetlograd, regional Governor Vladimir Vladimirov said on Telegram.

North Korean foreign minister arrives in Moscow for talks	moscow — North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has arrived in Moscow and will hold strategic consultations with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the ministry, in a post on her official Telegram channel, published photographs of Lavrov meeting Choe at a Moscow train station. 'Today, talks between the heads of Russia and the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) will be held in Moscow. Sergei Lavrov greeted his counterpart with a bouquet of flowers,' said Zakharova. 'The meeting began at the Yaroslavsky railway station (in Moscow), where a memorial plaque was unveiled to mark the occasion of Kim Il Sung's 1949 visit to the USSR,' she said, referring to the founder of the DPRK. The visit, Choe's second in six weeks, comes after Pyongyang tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile this week and as Washington says there are 10,000 North Korean troops in Russia, including as many as 8,000 deployed in Russia's Kursk region where Ukrainian troops have dug in. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that the United States expected the North Korean troops in Kursk region to enter the fight against Ukraine in the coming days. Moscow has neither denied nor directly confirmed the presence of North Korean troops on its soil. President Vladimir Putin has said it is for Russia to decide how to implement a treaty he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June that includes a mutual defense clause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-foreign-minister-arrives-in-moscow-for-talks/7847365.html	2024-11-01T02:25:41-07:00	
Israeli strikes kill 47 Palestinians in central Gaza, Palestinian news agency says	Gaza, Gaza Strip — Forty-seven Palestinians were killed and dozens injured, most of them children and women, in overnight Israeli bombardment of the the central Gaza Strip, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Friday. The attacks occurred in the city of Deir Al-Balah, the Nuseirat camp and the town of Al-Zawayda, it said. The Israeli military said its troops had identified and eliminated 'several armed terrorists' in central Gaza and had eliminated 'dozens of terrorists' in targeted raids in northern Gaza's Jabalia area. The Gaza war began after a Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. At least 46 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, mostly in the north where one attack hit a hospital, torching medical supplies and disrupting operations, the enclave's health officials said. Israel's military has accused the Palestinian militant group Hamas of using Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya for military purposes and said 'dozens of terrorists' have been hiding there. Health officials and Hamas deny the assertion. The health ministry in the Gaza Strip called for all international bodies 'to protect hospitals and medical staff from the brutality of the (Israeli) occupation.' Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Thursday that one of its doctors at the hospital, Mohammed Obeid, had been detained Saturday by Israeli forces. It called for the protection of him and all medical staff who 'are facing horrific violence as they try to provide care.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-47-palestinians-in-central-gaza-palestinian-news-agency-says/7847357.html	2024-11-01T02:16:39-07:00	
Russia gives former US Consulate employee nearly 5-year jail term	moscow — A Russian former employee of the U.S. Consulate in Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok has been sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison for 'secret collaboration with a foreign state,' Russian agencies said Friday. Robert Shonov worked for more than 25 years for the U.S. Consulate until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions. Afterward, he worked as a private contractor compiling news accounts from publicly accessible Russian media, according to the U.S. State Department. He was arrested this year on suspicion of passing secret information about Russia's war in Ukraine to the United States in exchange for money. According to the judgment published on the website of Valdivostok's Primorye court, $4,343 and an electronic device linked to the commission of the offense were seized. In September 2023, Russia also expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of acting as liaison agents for Shonov. According to Washington, Shonov had only been hired by the U.S. Consulate to carry out routine monitoring of freely accessible Russian media. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and sentenced to long jail terms in Russia. Others are being held pending trial. Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against Russia's invasion, accuses Moscow of wanting to exchange them for Russians held in the United States. The United States and Russia exchanged prisoners including The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in a landmark swap in August, but several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-gives-former-us-consulate-employee-nearly-5-year-jail-term/7847354.html	2024-11-01T02:00:07-07:00	
Exclusive: US says it is looking into case of American jailed in Iran	The Biden administration says it is looking into Iran's apparent recent detention of an Iranian American dual national who is the only U.S. citizen publicly reported to have been jailed by the Islamic republic since a rare U.S.-Iran prisoner swap in September 2023. Responding to a VOA inquiry last week the State Department said in a statement that it was 'aware of reports that a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran.' The reports refer to Reza Valizadeh, a former journalist for VOA sister network Radio Farda who had left the Persian-language network in 2022. He flew to Tehran in February to visit his family after living in the West for 14 years, according to his last post on the X platform in August. Iran views Radio Farda and other Western-based Persian media as hostile entities because they draw attention to public dissent and protests against the nation's authoritarian Islamist rulers. 'We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,' a State Department spokesperson said. 'Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries' citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law,' the spokesperson added. An informed source inside Iran told VOA's Persian Service that Valizadeh was arrested in Iran in late September on charges of collaborating with overseas-based Persian media. The source requested anonymity due to Iran's repeated harassment of individuals who provide comments publicly to Western media. The Iran-based human rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRAI) and the U.S.-based media rights group Committee to Protect Journalists reported in mid-October that Valizadeh had been held in Tehran's Evin prison without access to a lawyer since his arrest. The reports cited two sources: one close to Valizadeh's family, and one who previously worked with Valizadeh. Iran's U.N. mission in New York acknowledged receiving a VOA request for comment about Valizadeh's case last week but provided no response. Skylar Thompson, HRAI's Washington-based deputy director, said in a message to VOA that the State Department 'must utilize all available diplomatic channels to investigate Valizadeh's detention and ensure his immediate, unhindered access to legal counsel.' In his last X post in August, Valizadeh wrote that he had returned to Iran in February after having only 'half-completed' a negotiation with the intelligence arm of Iran's top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He said he decided to return voluntarily, even without having received a prior written or verbal commitment that the IRGC would not impede his visit. In Valizadeh's previous X post, published in February upon arrival in Iran, he said Iranian intelligence agents had summoned and pressured his family members to persuade him to return. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has tried to persuade Iranians living abroad that they have nothing to fear by returning. 'We must assure them that if they return to Iran, we will not file a case against them. We will not harass them, and we will not prevent them from leaving,' Pezeshkian said in an August interview with state news agency ISNA. Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, told VOA that Valizadeh's arrest should be a warning to Iranians with dual nationalities that Tehran's assurances cannot be trusted. 'There have been cases over the years in which Iranians abroad will get authorization from one governmental entity in Iran to enter, and then a competing agency will scoop up this person and take him hostage,' Brodsky said. Valizadeh was slated to go on trial before Revolutionary Court judge Abolghassem Salavati, according to sources cited by HRAI and Iranian freelance journalist Nejat Bahrami, who first reported Valizadeh's arrest in a social media post on October 13. Salavati has been sanctioned by the U.S. government for harshly punishing Iranian citizens and dual nationals for exercising their freedoms of expression or assembly. 'It seems as though Valizadeh is wrongfully detained,' said Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an Australian political scientist who herself was detained in Iran from 2018 to 2020 on what Western nations said were bogus security charges. In an email to VOA, Moore-Gilbert wrote that Valizadeh's journalism 'would certainly make him a person of interest to the IRGC.' 'The fact that he has been referred to the Revolutionary Court of Salavati is also telling, as this judge is favored by the IRGC for dealing with political cases including the wrongful detention of foreign and dual nationals,' she wrote. Granting a wrongful detention designation to a U.S. national means U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens is authorized to work with a coalition of government and private sector organizations to secure the detainee's freedom. Designations are granted if a review by the secretary of state concludes that the U.S. national's case meets criteria defined in the Levinson Act of 2020. Any of Valizadeh's family members residing abroad or legal representatives should 'immediately apply' to the U.S. secretary of state for a wrongful detention designation, Moore-Gilbert said. Valizadeh's recent work as a journalist should make the process 'relatively straightforward' in contrast to other cases, she added. The State Department spokesperson who sent the statement to VOA said the agency 'continuously monitors the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. citizens overseas for indicators that the detentions may be wrongful.' The Biden administration secured the release of five Iranian Americans whom it deemed wrongfully detained in Iran in a September 2023 deal in which five Iranians in the U.S. also won reprieves from detention and prosecution. That deal is the only U.S.-Iran prisoner exchange of Biden's term so far. It also involved the U.S. allowing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen under U.S. sanctions in South Korean banks to be transferred to Qatar for Iran to use for humanitarian purchases. A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson told U.S. media this month that the funds remain 'immobilized' following Iran's backing of the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel. 'Valizadeh's detention raises questions as to whether the Iranians are holding him hostage for an exchange involving the movement of those assets in Qatar or something even greater,' Brodsky said. 'Every time we do a deal like that, it emboldens the Iranians to take more hostages,' he added. 'So we need a comprehensive strategy, working with our allies and partners, to employ common hostage-taking penalties against Iran involving sanctions and diplomatic isolation.'

Russian disinformation campaign creates 'climate of chaos,' say experts	Washington — For regular audiences of Polish public broadcaster Polskie Radio, the headlines on its website appeared strange: 'The unacceptable truth: The EU will manage without Poland' and 'Ukraine will stay outside of the EU.' The pro-Russian, Euroskeptic narratives didn't align with the broadcaster's usual coverage. But at first glance, the website appeared legitimate. Those who looked closer saw the giveaway: The domain name of the site was polskieradio.icu. The real Polskie Radio’s domain is polskieradio.pl. The pro-Russian narratives were placed on a Russian cloned website — one specifically designed to mislead. The incident, recorded in April, is part of a wider trend of fake websites employed in a 'persistent' disinformation campaign spanning two years, according to an article published on the website of the Austria-based International Press Institute and signed by it and three other European press freedom groups. These watchdogs say Russian agents are creating false news websites that mimic reputable sources and posting fake stories to those phony sites. 'It’s really hard to see that it’s a fake website, so it really works,' said Camille Magnissalis, who monitors press freedom violations for the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ). 'If you don’t know, you can be easily misled.' The U.S. Department of Justice said in a September press release that such websites are part of 'Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns' informally known as 'Doppelganger,' after the German word for a person who is almost exactly identical to another. At the time, the Justice Department announced its 'ongoing seizure' of 32 internet domains used in Doppelganger campaigns. The websites may look like trusted European media outlets but in fact mislead readers with malicious stories and propaganda. That content is often shared on social media either through advertisements or bot accounts. 'It’s often related to political stakes because they want to influence people,' Magnissalis told VOA. 'In the end, these stories are integrated into the media landscape and have impact.' The Media Freedom Rapid Response (MFRR) consortium described the Russian disinformation campaign in its biannual media monitoring report covering the first half of 2024. European press freedom watchdogs, including EFJ and IPI, make up the consortium. In 2023, fake articles made up most of the content on the phony websites, according to the MFRR report. This year, most attacks have involved artificial intelligence, or AI, either as deepfake images or fake audio clips of well-known journalists. Such content destabilizes trust in the news and creates a 'climate of chaos' for European news readers, according to the report. The domains for these fake websites were purchased through cryptocurrency transactions, obscuring the identity of the purchaser. The crypto wallets used were associated with Russia, according to the IPI article. 'They use really refined techniques to mask the fact that they’re trying to misinform anyone,' said Karol Luczka, IPI's Eastern Europe monitoring and advocacy officer. 'They try to make sure nobody realizes that Russia is doing this.' The Russian operation has targeted Ukraine, Poland and Germany. It targeted France ahead of its presidential elections last summer, spoofing the website of the French daily Le Monde. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to VOA’s request for comment. Although the campaign is widespread throughout Europe, doppelganger websites first started appearing in Ukraine, attempting to manipulate the public's opinion of the Russia-Ukraine war, Luczka said. According to Luczka, the false stories on those sites primarily pushed one of three narratives: that Ukraine is losing the war, that Ukraine is running out of resources, or that the Ukrainian government is corrupt. Before 2022, Russia had primarily published disinformation in the Russian language. The modern-day doppelganger campaign, however, adapts its language to the targeted country. This difference makes audiences much more likely to believe what they are reading, Luczka told VOA. 'Russian disinformation tactics are becoming more subtle and more refined,' he said. 'That means they are also becoming more efficient, sadly and worryingly.' Facebook has been crucial to the popularization of these websites and their false information, Luczka said, adding that it is the main social media platform where Ukrainians receive news. Around 54% of the Ukrainian population uses Facebook, according to data collected by the World Population Review. This creates a challenge for big tech companies like Meta, Facebook's owner, Magnissalis of EFJ said. These platforms have a responsibility to monitor the disinformation posted to their website, she said, including that coming from Russian actors. 'They just create fake accounts and spread links to those websites everywhere,' Magnissalis said. 'It’s not new, but it is problematic.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-disinformation-campaign-creates-climate-of-chaos-say-experts/7847280.html	2024-11-01T01:36:13-07:00	
Moldova faces decisive vote under shadow of Russian interference	Chisinau, Moldova — Moldova's pro-Brussels leader Maia Sandu is in a tough fight in Sunday's presidential election with a challenger who wants closer ties with Moscow only two weeks after she won an EU membership referendum by a razor-thin margin. With Georgia reeling from a disputed election which returned its Moscow-friendly ruling party to power, all eyes are now on Moldova, which borders war-torn Ukraine. Russia has been accused of interfering in the elections of both former Soviet states, allegations rejected by Moscow. Sandu said her camp 'won justly in an unjust struggle' in the EU referendum on October 20 amid claims that pro-Russian opposition engaged in disinformation and vote-buying. But the 52-year-old former World Bank economist admitted she was in a 'difficult fight' in the second round of the presidential vote, after taking nearly 42.5 % of the vote in the first round. Her rival, Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor backed by the pro-Russian Socialists, picked up a higher-than-expected 25.95%. Vote-buying 'thieves' But Sunday's vote is likely to be a lot closer. Several pro-Russian candidates who ran in the first round have thrown their weight behind Stoianoglo, saying Moldova risked being dragged into war and becoming a second Ukraine. During his campaign, Stoianoglo -- who was fired as prosecutor by Sandu -- vowed to wage a 'balanced foreign policy' that would include both the EU and Russia. The 57-year-old boycotted the referendum he denounced as a 'parody,' with the socialists now contesting the results. With Washington warning that Moscow 'will again attempt to prevent Moldovans from exercising their sovereign right to choose their own leaders,' the government has been raising the alarm over 'electoral fraud.' Sandu took to social media to call on Moldovans not to give in to the 'thieves who give you money for votes and trample on your dignity, steal your freedom' and who will 'destroy Moldova for decades to come.' She also appealed to the judiciary to step up the fight against corruption, accusing 'criminal groups' of trying to bribe up to 300,000 voters. 'If you are offered money to vote against a candidate, refuse, otherwise you risk a fine,' loudspeakers warned shoppers in a supermarket in the capital of Chisinau, local media reported. Torn between 'East and West' Fears of Russian meddling have long been looming large. Fugitive oligarch and former politician Ilan Shor is suspected of having funneled almost $40 million from Russia into Moldova since September in a bid to corrupt voters. Convicted in absentia last year for fraud, Shor regularly brands Moldova a 'police state' and the West's 'obedient puppet.' Experts say the economic woes of Moldova -- already one of Europe's poorest countries -- have deepened amid high inflation, with European aid often providing the only lifeline. But four years after Sandu became Moldova's first woman president, the former Soviet republic appears deeply divided. Moldova's large diaspora as well as people living in the capital are mostly in favor of the pro-EU course. On the other hand, some remote villages and the inhabitants of the breakaway region of Transnistria as well as Gagauzia have been traditionally close to Russia. 'Both the East and the West want to drag us to their side,' Maria told AFP on the streets of Chisinau. The 30-year-old, who declined to give her surname, said Moldova should be 'independent' while maintaining 'good relations' with both sides. 'We will lose financial resources and the image our European partners have of us will be damaged' if Sandu does not win, said student Denis Parnao. Kalman Mizsei, an EU adviser to the government, said he is optimistic that 'Moldova's European course is going to continue.' Amid 'the terrible war in Ukraine and the bad news in Georgia, I still want to hope that Moldova will continue to offer a glimpse of hope,' he told journalists earlier this week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-faces-decisive-vote-under-shadow-of-russian-interference/7847348.html	2024-11-01T01:35:24-07:00	
North Korea says record test was new Hwasong-19 ICBM	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19, state media said on Friday, amid international uproar over its troops deployed to aid Russia in Ukraine. The launch on Thursday flew higher than any previous North Korean missile, according to the North as well as militaries in South Korea and Japan that tracked its flight deep into space before it splashed down in the ocean between Japan and Russia. State news agency KCNA lauded it as 'the world's strongest strategic missile.' While questions remain over North Korea's ability to guide such a missile and protect a nuclear warhead as it reenters the atmosphere, the Hwasong-19, like North Korea's other latest ICBMs, demonstrated the range to strike nearly anywhere in the United States. 'The new-type ICBM proved before the world that the hegemonic position we have secured in the development and manufacture of nuclear delivery means of the same kind is absolutely irreversible,' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said while overseeing the launch, KCNA reported. The launch, days before Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, drew swift condemnation from Washington and its allies in South Korea, Japan and Europe, as well as the United Nations secretary-general. 'The missile continues to underwrite the growing credibility of North Korea's strategic deterrent capabilities,' said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding that Kim appeared specifically interested in communicating that message to the United States. Pyongyang-Moscow ties On Friday, South Korea imposed new sanctions on 11 North Korean individuals and four entities over the ICBM test, naming officials for contributing to missile and nuclear development and channeling illegal foreign funds back to the country. A spokesperson for South Korea's unification ministry, which handles relations with the North, said the launch could have been for several purposes, including demonstrating military technology, pressuring Washington and diverting attention from the issue of sending North Korean troops to Russia. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy blasted what he called his allies' 'zero' response to Russia's deployment of North Korean troops for the war in Ukraine, which has also sparked worries that Moscow could provide sensitive military technology to Pyongyang in return. Russia and North Korea have not denied the troop deployments and have defended their right to help each other. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Pentagon was very early in its assessment phase of the missile launch 'and we don't see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement.' KCNA said the launch did not affect the safety of neighboring countries and was an appropriate military step in the face of threats from North Korea's enemies. Although Russia may provide some specialists to assist with inspections or modifications, Kim Dong-yup of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul expressed skepticism it would share sensitive technology with Pyongyang. 'Even if some level of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia is possible, they are likely to be very cautious when it comes to core military technologies.' Heavier payloads The Hwasong-19 will deploy alongside the Hwasong-18, which was first launched last year and is also powered by solid fuel, KCNA said. Solid-fuel missiles do not need to be fueled immediately ahead of launch, are often easier and safer to operate and require less logistical support than liquid-fuel weapons. 'It can be stored and moved anywhere, allowing for excellent mobility, stealth and survivability,' said Kim of the University of North Korean Studies. Photos released by KCNA showed a large, multi-stage missile launched from a canister carried by a transporter-erector-launcher vehicle. The agency showed photos from cameras that appeared to be attached to the missile, taking images of stage separations and the Earth. 'The increased length likely means a greater fuel capacity, which directly affects thrust and potentially increases range,' Kim said. But North Korea's existing missiles already had the range to reach anywhere in the United States, and the Hwasong-19's expanded capacity combined with larger payload section is more likely designed to be able to carry heavier, and potentially multiple, nuclear warheads, he said. 'North Korea may continue testing to see if, during the final reentry phase, the warheads can separate and each head toward individual targets,' Kim added. The Hwasong-19 flew of 1,001.2 kilometers for 85 minutes and 56 seconds before landing in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, with a maximum altitude of 7,687.5 kilometers, KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-record-test-was-new-hwasong-19-icbm/7847343.html	2024-11-01T01:16:24-07:00	
Bomb kills 7, mostly schoolchildren, in southwest Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — A bomb blast in southwestern Pakistan early Friday morning killed at least seven people, including five schoolchildren, and injured 17 others. Authorities said that a homemade bomb attached to a motorcycle was detonated in Mustang, a district in the violence-affected Balochistan province, apparently targeting a police patrol near a school. At least one police officer was among the dead, and several others also suffered injuries. The provincial government and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, condemned the violence as a 'terrorist attack.' No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Balochistan, renowned for its abundant natural resources, where several ethnic Baloch separatist groups routinely target security force members and government installations. On Tuesday, gunmen attacked workers at the site of a dam in the sparsely populated province’s Panjgur district, killing five and wounding two others. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, claimed responsibility for that attack. Last month, heavily armed assailants stormed a coal mine in another district and massacred 21 coal workers. BLA, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, and other allied insurgent groups claim to be fighting for Balochistan’s independence. They have also targeted China-funded projects in the province and Chinese nationals working on them, alleging Beijing is assisting Islamabad in exploiting the region’s resources. Both countries reject the charges and label insurgents as enemies of the development in impoverished Balochistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-kills-7-mostly-schoolchildren-in-southwest-pakistan/7847333.html	2024-11-01T00:54:06-07:00	
Botswana's president concedes defeat in election; ruling party's 58 years in power end	GABORONE, Botswana — Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat in the general election Friday, in a seismic moment of change for the county that ended the ruling party's 58 years in power. Masisi's concession came before final results were announced, with his Botswana Democratic Party trailing in fourth place in the parliamentary elections. The main opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change held a strong lead in the partial results, making its candidate, Duma Boko, the favorite to become president of a southern African country that is one of the world's biggest producers of mined diamonds. Masisi said he had called Boko to inform him he was conceding defeat. 'I concede the election,' Masisi said in an early morning news conference two days after the election. 'I am proud of our democratic processes. Although I wanted a second term, I will respectfully step aside and participate in a smooth transition process.' 'I look forward to attending the coming inauguration and cheering on my successor. He will enjoy my support.' Masisi's BDP dominated politics in Botswana for nearly six decades, since independence from Britain in 1966. The nation of just 2.5 million people will now be governed by another party for the first time in its democratic history. Botswana has been held up as one of Africa's most stable democracies, with its economy largely relying on diamonds. Botswana is the world's second biggest natural diamond producer behind Russia. But the mood for change was evident as a downturn in the global demand for diamonds badly impacted Botswana's economy, with unemployment rising to more than 27% this year as the government saw a sharp decrease in revenue from diamonds. Masisi and his party had faced criticism for not having done enough to diversify the economy. Doko is a 54-year-old lawyer who also contested elections in 2014 and 2019.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-concedes-defeat-in-election-ruling-party-s-58-years-in-power-end-/7847324.html	2024-11-01T00:44:00-07:00	
Tropical Storm Kong-rey threatens Shanghai and China's coast	BEIJING — Typhoon Kong-rey weakened to a tropical storm overnight and was forecast to bring heavy rain and high winds to Shanghai and other parts of China's east coast Friday. The storm crossed Taiwan at typhoon strength the previous day, bringing down trees and causing landslides that covered roads and damaged houses. Two people died and more than 500 others were injured. As workers and residents cleared up fallen trees and scattered scaffolding, a ride-hailing driver recounted a harrowing tale of being trapped in his vehicle after a huge tree uprooted and smashed into the passenger compartment Thursday night in Taipei, the capital city. Elsewhere in Taiwan, authorities in the east coast province of Hualien said they had restored contact with a Czech couple feared missing. The two had pitched a tent in Taroko National Park and were in good condition, according to the official Central News Agency. Kong-rey, which is a Cambodian name, was heading northeast along the Chinese coast with winds of 83 kph and could make landfall in Zhejiang province before veering back out to sea, the National Meteorological Center said. The passing storm is expected to affect Shanghai and parts of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, with torrential rain of 10 to 12 centimeters possible in some areas. Zhejiang and neighboring Fujian province suspended multiple ferry routes ahead of the approaching storm. In Taiwan, light rain fell Friday morning in the capital of Taipei, while island-wide, schools and offices had largely reopened and public services were mostly restored. The typhoon passed north of the Philippines earlier in the week, prompting fresh evacuations just days after devastating Tropical Storm Trami killed at least 145 people the previous week. Intense rainfall caused in part by Trami also killed seven people in China's Hainan province as the storm passed by the island, which is known for its beach resorts, off the country's southern coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-kong-rey-threatens-shanghai-and-china-s-coast/7847317.html	2024-11-01T00:17:08-07:00	
Toxic smog cloaks New Delhi a day after Diwali festival	NEW DELHI — A thick layer of toxic smog cloaked India's capital on Friday as smoke from firecrackers used to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, pushed air pollution to hazardous levels. New Delhi's air quality index plunged into the 'severe' category, according to SAFAR, India's main environmental monitoring agency. In many areas, levels of deadly particulate matter reached seven times the World Health Organization's safety limit. Authorities in the capital have banned the use and sale of traditional firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for environmentally friendly ones or light shows instead, but the rule is often flouted. New Delhi, home to more than 33 million people, is regularly ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world. The air pollution crisis deepens particularly in the winter when the burning of crop residue in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. That smoke travels to New Delhi, leading to a surge in pollution and worsening the public health crisis. Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal, which produces most of the country's electricity, are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas. 'We may not realize it now, but later we will face lung problems,' said Manoj Kumar, a New Delhi resident who does his morning runs around the capital's iconic India Gate monument. Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. Tiny particulate matter in polluted air can lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of major health problems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toxic-smog-cloaks-new-delhi-a-day-after-diwali-festival/7847314.html	2024-11-01T00:06:15-07:00

Iraq gets new parliament speaker after yearlong deadlock	After nearly a year’s deadlock, Iraq’s parliament elected a new speaker Thursday. Prominent Sunni lawmaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who served as parliament’s speaker from 2006 to 2009, was elected by 182 of the 269 politicians in attendance. Iraq’s parliament has been without a speaker since last November, following a ruling of the Federal Supreme Court in a case that involved then-speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi, the country’s most powerful Sunni politician, and fellow lawmaker Laith al-Dulaimi, also Sunni. In the lawsuit, Dulaimi claimed Halbousi forged Dulaimi’s signature on a resignation letter, according to an Associated Press report. Halbousi denied the claim. Iraq’s top court’s ruling in the case dismissed both lawmakers from parliament but did not give a reason for the verdict. Iraq’s political landscape operates under a delicate power-sharing system, created to avoid factional conflict. Under the arrangement, the country’s president is always a Kurd, the prime minister is Shite and parliament’s speaker is Sunni. Mashhadani’s selection as speaker was made possible by a Sunni and Shite bloc, according to reports. Under such a fragmented system, the speaker plays a critical role. The speaker is expected to ensure that politicians adhere to proper legislative order. In addition, the speaker is also tasked with resolving conflicts and building consensus among the lawmakers. Mashhadani assumes the speaker position at a critical and fractious time, as the Middle East has erupted in wars and Iraq is seeking to maintain its relationships with several countries, including former adversaries Iran and the U.S. Some information provided by Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-gets-new-parliament-speaker-after-yearlong-deadlock/7847278.html	2024-10-31T21:33:59-07:00	
College athletes push for voter turnout while largely avoiding controversy as election nears	Lily Meskers faced an unexpected choice in the lead-up to the first major election she can vote in. The 19-year-old University of Montana sprinter was among college athletes in the state who received an inquiry from Montana Together asking if she was interested in a name, image and likeness deal to support Sen. Jon Tester, a three-term Democrat seeking re-election. The group, which is not affiliated with the Tester campaign, offered from $400 to $2,400 to athletes willing to produce video endorsements. Meskers, who is from Colorado but registered to vote in Montana, decided against the deal because she disagrees with Tester's votes on legislation involving transgender athletes in sports. 'I was like, OK, I believe that this is a political move to try to gain back some voters that he might have lost,' Meskers said. 'And me being a female student-athlete myself, I was not going to give my endorsement to someone who I felt didn't have the same support for me.' Professional athletes such as LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick and Stephen Curry have taken high-profile stances on hot-button topics and political campaigns in recent years, but college athletes are far less outspoken — even if money is available, according to experts in the NIL field. Being outwardly political can reflect on their school or endanger potential endorsement deals from brands that don't want controversy. It can certainly establish a public image for an athlete — for better or for worse — or lead to tensions with teammates and coaches who might not feel the same way. There are examples of political activism by college athletes: A Texas Tech kicker revealed his support for former President Donald Trump on a shirt under his uniform at a game last week and a handful of Nebraska athletes a few days ago teamed up in a campaign ad against an abortion measure on the Tuesday's ballot. Still, such steps are considered rare. 'It can be viewed as risky and there may be people telling them just don't even take that chance because they haven't made it yet,' said Lauren Walsh, who started a sports branding agency 15 years ago. She said there is often too much to lose for themselves, their handlers and in some cases, their families. 'And these individuals still have to figure out what they're going to do with the rest of their lives, even those that do end up getting drafted,' she added. College coaches are not always as reticent. Auburn men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl has used social media to make it clear he does not support Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic opponent in next week's presidential election. Oklahoma State football coach Mike Gundy once caused a stir with a star player for wearing a shirt promoting a far-right news outlet. Blake Lawrence, co-founder of the NIL platform Opendorse, noted that this is the first presidential election in the NIL era, which began in July 2021. He said athletes are flocking to opportunities to help increase voter turnout in the 18-to-24 age demographic, adding that one of his company's partners has had 86 athletes post social media messages encouraging turnout through the first half of the week. He said athletes are shying away from endorsing specific candidates or causes that are considered partisan. 'Student-athletes are, for the most part, still developing their confidence in endorsing any type of product or service,' he said. 'So if they are hesitant to put their weight behind supporting a local restaurant or an e-commerce product, then they are certainly going to be hesitant to use their social channels in a political way.' Giving athletes a voice Many college athletes have opted to focus on drumming up turnout in a non-partisan manner or simply using their platforms to take stands that are not directly political in nature. Some of those efforts can be found in battleground states. A progressive group called NextGen America said it had signed players in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia to encourage voting among young people. Another organization, The Team, said it prepped 27 college athletes in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Michigan to lead volunteer voter participation opportunities for students. The organization also said it got more than 625 coaches to sign a nonpartisan pledge to get their athletes registered to vote. The Team's executive director is Joe Kennedy, a former coach who coordinated championship visits and other sporting events at the White House during President Barack Obama's administration. In early October, it hosted a Zoom event during which panelists such as NCAA President Charlie Baker and WNBA players Nneka Ogwumike and Natasha Cloud gave college athletes advice about using their platforms on campus. In its early days, The Team seized upon momentum from the record turnout seen in the 2020 election. The NCAA that year said Division I athletes could have Election Day off from practice and play to vote. Lisa Kay Solomon, founder of the All Vote No Play campaign, said even if the athletes don't immediately take stands on controversial issues, it's important for them to learn how. 'It is a lot to ask our young people to feel capable and confident on skills they've never had a chance to practice,' Solomon said. 'We have to model what it means to practice taking risks, practice standing up for yourself, practice pausing to think about what are the values that you care about — not what social media is feeding into your brain, but what do you care about and how do you express that? And how do you do it in a way that honors the kind of future that you want to be a part of?' Shut up and play? Two years ago, Tennessee-Martin quarterback Dresser Winn said he would support a candidate in a local district attorney general race in what experts said was very likely the first political NIL deal by a college athlete. There have been very few since. The public criticism and fallout for athletes who speak out on politics or social issue can be sharp. Kaepernick, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, hasn't played in an NFL game since January 2017, not long after he began kneeling during the national anthem at games. Meskers, the Montana sprinter, said political endorsements through NIL deals could create problems for athletes and their schools. 'I just think that NIL is going to run into a lot of trouble and a lot of struggles if they continue to let athletes do political endorsements,' she said. 'I just think it's messy. But I stand by NIL as a whole. I think it's really hard as a student athlete to create a financial income and support yourself.' Walsh said it's easier for wealthy and veteran stars like James and Ogwumike to take stands. James, the Los Angeles Lakers star, started More Than a Vote — an organization with a mission to 'educate, energize and protect Black voters' — in 2020. He has passed the leadership to Ogwumike, who just finished her 13th year in the WNBA and also is the president of the Women's National Basketball Players Association. More than a Vote is focused on women's rights and reproductive freedom this year. 'They have very established brands,' Walsh said. 'They know who they are and they know what their political stance is. They know that they have a really strong following that -- there's always going to be haters, but they're also always going to have that strong following of people who listen to everything that they have to say.' Andra Gillespie, an associate professor at Emory University who teaches African American politics, also said it is rare that a college athlete would make a significant impact with a political stand simply because they tend to have a more regional platform than national. Even celebrities like Taylor Swift and Eminem are better at increasing turnout than championing candidates. 'They are certainly very beneficial in helping to drive up turnout among their fans,' Gillespie said. 'The data is less conclusive about whether or not they're persuasive – are they the ones who are going to persuade you to vote for a particular candidate?' Athletes as influencers Still, campaigns know young voters are critical this election cycle, and athletes offer an effective and familiar voice to reach them. Political and social topics are not often broached, but this week six Nebraska athletes — five softball players and a volleyball player — appeared in an ad paid for by the group Protect Women and Children involving two initiatives about abortion laws on Tuesday's ballot. The female athletes backed Initiative 434, which would amend the state constitution to prohibit abortions after the first trimester, with exceptions. Star softball player Jordy Bahl said on social media that the athletes were not paid. A University of Montana spokesperson said two athletes initially agreed to take part in the NIL deal backing Tester. The school said one withdrew and the other declined to be interviewed. For Meskers, deciding against the offer boiled down to Tester twice voting against proposals to bar federal funds from going to schools that allow transgender athletes to play women's sports, a prominent GOP campaign topic. Tester's campaign said the proposals were amendments to government spending packages, and he didn't want to play a role in derailing them as government shutdowns loomed. 'As a former public school teacher and school board member, Jon Tester believes these decisions should be made at the local level,' a Tester spokesperson said. 'He has never voted to allow men to compete against women.' Meskers said she believes using influence as college athletes is good and she is in favor of NIL. She just doesn't think the two should mix specifically for supporting candidates. 'I think especially as student athletes, we do have such a big voice and we do have a platform to use,' she said. 'So I think if you're encouraging people to do their civic duties and get up and go (vote), I think that's a great thing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/college-athletes-push-for-voter-turnout-while-largely-avoiding-controversy-as-election-nears/7847277.html	2024-10-31T21:24:35-07:00	
Ukraine doubles down on psychological campaign against North Korean troops	Washington — As North Korean troops prepare to join Russian forces in the war on Ukraine, Kyiv is stepping up a psychological warfare campaign to target the North Korean soldiers, a high-ranking Ukraine official said. The effort is liable to get a boost from a team of South Korean military observers that Seoul’s defense minister, Kim Yong-hyun, said this week will be going to Ukraine to watch and analyze the North Korean troops on the battlefield. Last week, the Ukrainian military intelligence service-run project 'I Want to Live' released a Korean-language video message on YouTube and X. The project also posted a Korean-language text message on Telegram. The messages urged North Korean soldiers to surrender, arguing that they do not have to 'meaninglessly die on the land of another country.' It also offered to provide food, shelters and medical services. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the Center for Combating Disinformation under Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told VOA Ukrainian on Wednesday that 'in the future, additional videos featuring North Koreans will be published.' 'The North Koreans will undergo training in modern warfare and then be used in actual combat,' Kovalenko said. 'We (the Center for Combating Disinformation) are actively involved in identifying the individuals who have arrived and the units they are joining, as well as gathering evidence of their presence in Russia, their likely participation in combat against the Ukrainian army, and their presence in temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine.' Influence campaign Ukraine has been running similar psychological operations toward the Russian soldiers since the beginning of the Russian invasion, U.S. experts said. 'Ukraine has been doing that with the Russians early on in the war,' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told VOA Korean on the phone Thursday. 'They got a lot of Russians to defect, and I suspect they will try to do the same things with the North Koreans.' Bennett added that drones can also be used for sending messages in leaflets and in audio form to North Korean soldiers in the war zone. David Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel who served on the Combined Forces Command of the U.S and South Korea, said this could be 'a great opportunity' to learn how to employ psychological tactics on North Korean forces in the time of war. 'Bombing and gunfire doesn’t happen 24/7,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Wednesday. 'Military operations are also characterized by large amounts of boredom and inactivity, where soldiers are waiting for something to happen, and this is the time when loudspeakers and leaflets can really have an effect, because those messages give them something to think about.' Earlier this week, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed in a phone call 'to intensify the intelligence and expertise exchange' and 'to develop an action strategy and a list of countermeasures,' according to a statement released by the Ukrainian presidential office. Some experts in South Korea said the team of South Korean military observers headed to Ukraine will likely include psychological warfare strategists who can offer advice to the Ukrainian officials. Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification, said psychological warfare could be a real threat to the North Korean army. 'In the case of North Korean soldiers, they now have been mobilized for a war without any justification,' he told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. 'It is hardly likely that they have a strong will or high morale.' South Korea’s role Cho said the South Korean government can help Ukraine develop psychological tactics against North Korean soldiers, since the country 'has the know-how of a long-term psychological war with North Korea.' Ban Kil-joo is a senior research professor at Korea University’s Ilmin International Relations Institute. He told VOA Korean in a phone interview Tuesday that psychological warfare could help weaken the military cohesiveness between Russia and North Korea. 'The Ukrainians don't know much about North Korea, don’t understand the North Korean culture, as we do,' Ban said. 'We can provide indirect support in a more social sense, rather than military or operational support.' Ban added that it is important for the South Korean team to be 'well-integrated with the Ukrainian forces through its supporting role,' to achieve the desired political and operational effect of a psychological campaign. Other experts, however, are not convinced that psychological warfare will be effective to persuade North Korean soldiers to surrender. Mykola Polishchuk, a Ukrainian author who wrote the book Northern Korea in Simple Words, said Ukraine’s counterpropaganda will not work with North Korean soldiers. 'As for North Koreans, they are not particularly politicized,' Polishchuk told VOA Ukrainian. 'These individuals have little interest in politics.' Robert Rapson, a former charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean that South Korea should carefully make a decision about whether to be engaged in Ukraine’s psychological warfare. 'If the ROK [Republic of Korea] does decide to deploy technical personnel to Ukraine to solely monitor and help advise the Ukraine military on matters related to North Korean troops deployed to the region, they would need to ensure they do not acquire, inadvertently or otherwise, status as combatants,' he said. 'There are, of course, clear risks to ROK personnel whether they’re combatants or not.' Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has deepened military ties with North Korea. North Korea has exported dozens of ballistic missiles and more than 18,000 containers of munitions and munitions-related material to Russia since the invasion, according to the U.S. State Department. In June, the two countries signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement mandating immediate military assistance if either of them is attacked by a third country. VOA Korean’s Kim Hyungjin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-doubles-down-on-psychological-campaign-against-north-korean-troops/7847270.html	2024-10-31T21:07:13-07:00	
Bird flu infects 3 more people; number of human cases in US grows to 39	Bird flu has infected three more people from Washington state after they were exposed to poultry that tested positive for the virus, according to health authorities in Washington and in Oregon, where the human cases were identified. A total of 39 people have tested positive for bird flu in the U.S. this year, including nine from Washington, as the virus has infected poultry flocks and spread to more than 400 dairy herds, federal data show. All of the cases were farm workers who had known contact with infected animals, except for one person in Missouri. The people from Washington cleaned facilities at an infected chicken farm after birds were culled to contain the virus, the Washington State Department of Health said in an email on Thursday. Officials tested workers who had symptoms, including red eyes and respiratory issues, and those with potential exposure to the birds, the department said. People with symptoms were told to isolate and given antiviral treatment, it added. Oregon identified the three new cases after the people traveled to the state from Washington while infected, the Oregon Health Authority said in a Thursday statement. They have since returned to Washington, where public health staff are monitoring them, according to the statement. There have been no infections among people living in Oregon and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, the Oregon Health Authority said. It said the risk for infection to the general public remains low. Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak. H5N1 bird flu was confirmed in a pig on a backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-infects-3-more-people-number-of-human-cases-in-us-grows-to-39/7847242.html	2024-10-31T20:05:14-07:00	
Mystery surrounds detention of Wagner Group operative in Chad	A shadowy Russian political operator with close ties to the notorious Wagner Group and its late founder Yevgeny Prigozhin is detained in Chad on unexplained charges, adding a fresh chapter to his long career of mystery and intrigue. Russian officials and state-controlled media maintain that Maxim Shugaley, who was detained on September 19 along with two other Russians, is an innocent sociologist who was in Chad to deliver humanitarian aid and participate in a pro-Russian event in the capital, N'Djamena. But years of reporting on his exploits in countries as far-flung as Afghanistan and Libya present a picture of a master propagandist who has worked behind the scenes to advance the Kremlin's interests with some of the world's least reputable regimes. Shugaley, president of the St. Petersburg-based Foundation for National Values Protection, or FNZC, was arrested at N'Djamena's airport 'without explanation,' according to an account this week in the Russian news agency RIA Novosty. The report quoted the press attache at Russia's mission in Chad saying the three Russians are being well-treated and that she looks forward to their early release. But it offered no explanation of why they were detained and little on why they were there. However the Russian daily Kommersant and a Paris-based weekly Jeune Afrique reported in late September and early October that Chadian military intelligence was behind Shugaley's arrest, and said he was accused of espionage and influence activities on behalf of the Wagner Group. Kommersant said Shugaley maintains his innocence and 'had no knowledge of Wagner activities in N'Djamena' — this despite his reputed role in directing communications and hybrid warfare activities by the Kremlin-financed mercenary, which according to the U.S. State Department plotted to overthrow the government of Chad last year. The Russian newspaper cited people close to Shugaley as saying that the 'sociologist's mission' in Chad was 'strictly humanitarian.' It added that a suitcase in his possession at the time of his arrest 'was full of souvenirs and cookies to be handed over at the pro-Russian rally in N'Djamena.' Citing a source familiar with the case, Central African Republic-based Corbeau news Centrafrique reported that Shugaley and his companions were arrested for trying to 'infiltrate the Chadian security services.' Whatever the truth of those reports, they are not out of character with previous accounts of Shugaley's career and his own postings on Telegram — the Wagner Group's favored messaging app — where he runs his own channel with almost 18,000 subscribers. In 2019, the FNZC organization that Shugaley heads was sanctioned by the U.S. State Department for serving in a covert operation to manipulate African politics in favor of the Kremlin by 'sponsoring phony election monitoring missions,'' and promoting 'disinformation operations.' The Wall Street Journal profiled Shugaley in 2021 as a 'spy' and a 'shadowy figure' pursuing the Kremlin's strategic goals across Africa. His latest post on Telegram, dated August 23, laments the death of Prigozhin, killed in a suspicious helicopter crash a year earlier. Shugaley calls the Wagner founder a 'Russian hero' who is 'very much needed now in the Kursk Oblast.' The post coincided with Ukraine's military intrusion into Russia's Kursk region. In earlier posts dating back to May of this year, Shugaley reported he was in Chad to observe the presidential elections, which he describes as successful, 'despite the U.S. destabilizing efforts.' In June, Shugaley said in a Telegram post that he was in Chad 'for the second time in less than two months' to prepare the introduction of a Russian House in N'Djamena, which he said was a 'natural development' given the Chadians 'anti-French sentiments and mistrust of the U.S. actions in the region.' In April 2023, The Washington Post reported that leaked U.S. intelligence documents showed the Wagner Group was trying to recruit 'Chadian rebels and establish a training site for 300 fighters in the neighboring Central African Republic as part of an evolving plot to topple the Chadian government.'' The European Union sanctioned Shugaley in February 2023 for operating 'as the public relations arm' of the Wagner Group. Shugaley's role 'includes directing propaganda and disinformation campaigns in favor of the Wagner Group, particularly to improve the reputation of Wagner and support its deployment, as well as interfering in a covert manner on behalf of the Wagner group in the various countries where the group is active,' the EU said. In May 2019, Shugaley and his interpreter Samer Sueifan were jailed for 18 months in Libya on charges of espionage and election interference. Libyan officials said the mission of the two was to 'recruit Libyans to gather information and to train them on how to influence any future Libyan elections.'' Shugaley credited Prigozhin for his freedom in interviews with Russian media and in social media posts, saying that under his order, Wagner troops stormed the prison in Tripoli in December 2020 to free him. Prigozhin later commissioned an action movie lauding Shugaley and Wagner. His company, Concord, paid a $250,000 bonus to Shugaley and Sueifan. Shugaley is a common figure in Central Africa Republic, a territory where Wagner mercenaries have been deeply embedded in the security system since 2018. In February, the U.S. State Department issued a report titled, 'The Wagner Group Atrocities in Africa: Lies and Truth,' which documented violations committed by the group in CAR, Libya, Sudan, and Mali. The State Department said, 'In CAR, Wagner forces used indiscriminate killing, abductions, and rape to gain control of a key mining area near the city of Bambari, with survivors describing the attacks in detail.' A BBC documentary in 2019 reported that 'at least six candidates were offered money by Russians in the lead-up to the 2018 presidential elections in Madagascar.' The BBC reported that Shugaley was among those 'offering money' to various actors to sway the votes in favor of a Kremlin-backed candidate. According to the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, after the death of Prigozhin, Shugaley partnered with the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who was released from a U.S. jail in 2022 in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. The group said Shugaley assisted Bout in winning a seat in the regional assembly of the city of Ulyanovsk in September 2023 as part of an ultra-nationalist party. ''In updates posted on the Telegram channel, Shugaley has reported on discussing plans with Bout to export military utility vehicles and aircraft to Africa,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mystery-intrigue-surround-detention-of-wagner-group-operative-in-chad-/7847204.html	2024-10-31T20:02:25-07:00

N. Korea boasts about new long-range missile, calls it 'world's strongest'	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Friday bragged about its recently tested new intercontinental ballistic missile, calling it 'the world's strongest.' Outside experts saw the claim as propaganda, though the test did show advancement in the North's quest to build a more reliable weapons arsenal. A missile that North Korea launched Thursday flew higher and stayed in the air longer than any other weapon the country has so far fired. It signaled that the North has achieved progress in acquiring a nuclear-armed ICBM that can hit the U.S. mainland. But foreign experts said the country has still a few technological issues to master. On Friday, the North's Korean Central News Agency identified the missile as the 'Hwasong-19' ICBM and called it 'the world's strongest strategic missile' and 'the perfected weapon system.' KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un observed the launch, describing it as 'an appropriate military action' to express North Korea's resolve to respond to its enemies' moves that escalated tensions and threats to North Korea's national security. It said Kim thanked weapons scientists for demonstrating North Korea's 'matchless strategic nuclear attack capability.' South Korea's military earlier said that North Korea could have tested a solid-fuel missile, but Friday's KCNA dispatch didn't say what propellant the Hwasong-19 ICBM uses. Observers said the color of exhaust flames seen in North Korean media photos of the launch suggested the new ICBM uses solid fuels. Before Thursday's test, North Korea's most advanced ICBM was known as the Hwasong-18 missile, which uses solid fuels. Pre-loaded solid propellants make it easier to move missiles and require much less launch preparation times than liquid propellants that must be fueled before liftoffs. So it's more difficult for opponents to detect launches by solid-fuel missiles. In recent years, North Korea has reported steady advancement in its efforts to obtain nuclear-tipped missiles. Many foreign experts believe North Korea likely has missiles that can deliver nuclear strikes on all of South Korea, but it has yet to possess nuclear missiles that can travel to the mainland U.S. There are questions about whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric reentry. Many foreign analysts say North Korea also must improve altitude control and guidance systems for missiles. They say North Korea needs the ability to place multiple warheads on a single missile to defeat its rivals' missile defenses. All of North Korea's known ICBM tests, including Thursday's, have been performed at steep angles to avoid neighboring countries. South Korean military spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said Thursday that a high-angle trajectory launch cannot verify a missile's re-entry vehicle technology, though North Korea has previously claimed to have acquired that technology. Observers say that Thursday's launch, the North's first ICBM test in almost a year, was largely meant to grab American attention days before the U.S. presidential election and respond to international condemnation of North Korea's reported dispatch of troops to Russia to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. North Korea's reported troop dispatch highlights the expanding military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. South Korea. the U.S. and others worry North Korea might seek high-tech, sensitive Russian technology to perfect its nuclear and missile programs in return for joining the Russia-Ukraine war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/n-korea-boasts-about-new-long-range-missile-calls-it-world-s-strongest-/7847221.html	2024-10-31T18:55:25-07:00

Trump sues US television network for $10 billion over Harris interview	washington — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sued CBS News on Thursday over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on the network's '60 Minutes' news program this month. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Northern District of Texas, alleged that the network aired two different responses from Harris responding to a question about the Israel-Hamas war. The version that aired during the '60 Minutes' program on October 6 did not include what the lawsuit referred to as a 'word salad' response from Harris about the Biden administration's influence on Israel's conduct of the war. The lawsuit follows Trump's threats to revoke CBS's broadcasting license if elected. Trump's campaign and office did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The suit called for a jury trial and about $10 billion in damages, the filing showed. It alleges violations of a Texas law that prohibits deceptive acts in the conduct of business. A CBS News spokesperson told VOA that 'Trump's repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false' and that the interview was not doctored. '60 MINUTES fairly presented' the interview 'to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it,' the spokesperson said in an email. 'The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it.' In a statement earlier this month, CBS said '60 Minutes' gave an excerpt of the Harris interview to 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than what was aired on '60 Minutes.' 'Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,' the statement said. 'The portion of her answer on '60 Minutes' was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide-ranging, 21-minute-long segment.' And in a letter to Trump's legal counsel earlier this month, CBS said Trump has no legal basis to sue over the interview, CNN reported. Trump had also agreed to give an interview to '60 Minutes' before ultimately backing out. Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without Borders, dismissed the lawsuit as a publicity stunt. 'The lawsuit itself looks like a publicity stunt, but it reinforces the very real threats that Trump has issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn't like should he regain the White House,' Weimers told VOA. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-sues-us-television-network-for-10-billion-over-harris-interview-/7847189.html	2024-10-31T18:00:44-07:00	
Junta airstrikes lay waste to civilian lives in Myanmar's Karenni State	Paekon Township, Myanmar / WASHINGTON — In a crowded church filled with mourners on September 6, a young high school teacher sat among friends, her face streaked with tears as she gazed at the makeshift shrouds covering the small bodies laid out before her. Among them were her students — children she had taught, known and cared for deeply. 'I couldn't recognize some of them,' she whispered to me, her voice trembling. The previous night, the war refugee camp where she lives in Myanmar's Paekon Township, near the Karenni and Shan state borders, had been transformed into a scene of unimaginable loss. The ruling junta had dropped two 500-pound bombs on the camp, killing 10 people, seven of them children. The attack unfolded just before 9 p.m. local time, as families were settling in for the night. The ominous hum of a military plane filled the air, circling over the camp. Shouts of 'Run! Run!' echoed as people scrambled for safety, but there was barely time to react. The teacher described the chaos, recounting how, on its second pass, the plane released a bomb that tore through makeshift shelters filled with families. 'The children were covered in blood, wandering aimlessly in the dark,' she said, her voice heavy with grief. 'Some were hit directly — only their small hands were visible. It was horrific.' On the ground, scattered amid the rubble, lay textbooks and notebooks filled with the handwriting of the students — evidence of lives interrupted and dreams shattered. Pages written by those young hands lay torn and trampled, a haunting reminder of the futures lost in the blast. Throughout the night, Karenni Armed Revolutionary Forces and camp officials worked tirelessly to rescue survivors and tend to the wounded, but the losses were devastating. In the dim light of the following morning, the teacher's sorrow echoed through the crowd of mourners, each bearing the weight of lives cut short. 'There is no safe place, no demilitarized zone,' she told me. 'We cannot live like this, in constant fear.' State symbolizes hope Karenni State, known as Kayah, a beautiful mountainous region in eastern Myanmar, has become a powerful symbol of resistance and resilience in the country's fight for democracy and federalism. Nestled along the border with Thailand, Karenni is home to a diverse ethnic community with a distinct cultural heritage. Decades of conflict with Myanmar's military regimes, beginning with Karenni's fight for independence in 1957, have left the region deeply scarred. Yet its people push forward, determined to build a self-governing future and protect their land. Reaching Karenni involved a challenging three-week journey, crossing from Thailand along rugged mountain roads while carefully avoiding junta outposts. Travel was only possible in areas controlled by Karenni resistance forces, who provided protection along the way. Eventually, I reached Demoso, a town about 138 miles from Naypyidaw, the junta's military-built capital. In Demoso, where electricity is rare, residents depend on generators and Starlink for internet, though outages are frequent. Artillery fire and airstrikes echo through the hills, a constant reminder of the relentless conflict gripping the region. Despite these challenges, local leaders have forged ahead with efforts to establish a self-governing administration, train young resistance fighters and rebuild communities. Their successes have made them a model for other ethnic states in Myanmar striving for a future grounded in democracy and federalism. 'Feels like retaliation' The day after the airstrike, survivors and community members gathered at a Catholic cathedral about a 20-minute drive from the refugee camp to mourn the 10 lives lost in the junta's assault. Inside the church, the bodies of six children lay surrounded by grieving friends and neighbors; outside, makeshift graves marked the final resting places of others who had perished in the attack. The crowd gathered in silence, their faces clouded with sorrow as they paid their last respects. A Catholic priest who also volunteers as a health worker voiced his suspicions about the timing of the bombing. 'The junta's soldiers are dying in battles at the front. Just days ago, their chairman, Min Aung Hlaing, visited Loikaw and was fired upon,' he said. 'This [bombing] feels like retaliation against innocent refugees who had no way to defend themselves,' he said, his voice filled with quiet anger. 'No time to run' As I spoke with the survivors, their tragic stories weighed on me. I met a 14-year-old girl with severe injuries to her face and thigh when I visited a makeshift hospital whose exact location cannot be disclosed for security reasons. Her younger brother, just 2 years old, had been hit in the head and could not be saved. 'We were all sitting in our tent. I heard the plane but had no time to run,' she said. Two sisters, both young students, lay nearby with broken bones and deep wounds. Their parents had sent them to the camp to protect them from the fighting. I spoke to another seriously injured patient, the wife of a police officer who was injured in an earlier bombing that same morning. Her husband, standing next to her, told me, 'They dropped two bombs on the building, then opened fire with machine guns. My wife is four months pregnant, and we lost the baby.' Junta denies responsibility At Dosei Middle School, located west of Demoso, the principal described to me the devastating attack on February 5 that leveled all three of the school's buildings. 'The school, once filled with the lively shouts of students, fell silent within minutes as the sound of an approaching plane grew louder,' she recounted. 'The roar of bombs exploding was quickly followed by the rattle of machine gunfire, leaving the classroom lifeless — the last refuge of four middle school students. There was no time to reach a bomb shelter.' She added, 'The elementary school children were incredibly lucky — they were outside for physical activities when the junta's jet dropped bombs on the other side of the building. Otherwise, every child, including my youngest daughter, who studies here, would have been buried beneath the rubble.' The junta consistently denies responsibility for civilian deaths caused by airstrikes in Karenni. Following the jet attack on February 5, the junta's information team stated, 'There were no Tatmadaw [Myanmar army] flights in Demoso Township on that day.' Since the military seized power on February 1, 2021, Karenni State has become a battlefield, with civilians trapped between junta forces and Karenni resistance fighters. Just one day before the September 5 airstrike, General Min Aung Hlaing arrived in Loikaw to meet with his troops. In response, the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force fired artillery toward Loikaw. The following night, junta forces shelled northern areas of Demoso, forcing families to flee again. Pleas for protection Throughout Karenni State, survivors echo the same plea — a desperate call for protection from relentless airstrikes and shelling. The Interim Executive Council of Karenni State, or IEC, condemned the bombing as 'unprovoked violence' targeting civilians, including children. At the site of the attack, the head of the Interior Department of the IEC expressed his outrage: 'I absolutely condemn this. It's pure bullying — a brutal act of violence that I cannot accept. This is Karenni territory, where our people live and work. The damage is not only to property but to lives.' The principal of Dosei Middle School also made a heartfelt appeal for action by the international community, including a halt to the sale of jet fuel to the junta and for stronger international pressure to stop the use of airstrikes against civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/junta-airstrikes-lay-waste-to-civilian-lives-in-myanmar-s-karenni-state/7846878.html	2024-10-31T17:39:26-07:00	
Chinese student convicted in US returned to China	washington — Xiaolei Wu, a Chinese student who had been serving a nine-month prison sentence for threatening pro-democracy activists in Boston, received an early release on September 16 and returned to China, according to federal documents obtained by VOA’s Mandarin Service. U.S. and Chinese officials have not commented publicly on Wu and whether he may have been part of a prisoner swap, but his return to China came about the time that American pastor David Lin was released and returned to the United States after serving 18 years in prison. Documents from the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts and the U.S. Justice Department confirm Wu's release and that President Joe Biden signed a clemency document on September 12, reducing Wu's total sentence to time served, saying that it was in the 'national interest' of the United States for him not to serve his full sentence. The pardon document states that Wu began serving his sentence on June 7. The conditions for the commutation said Wu must leave the United States and never again set foot on U.S. soil and territories, and that he must not commit any crimes against the U.S. or violate U.S. laws again. Wu, a former student of Berklee College of Music, was found guilty in January of stalking and threatening a pro-democracy activist in Boston in fall 2022. On April 24, Wu was sentenced to nine months in prison and three years of supervised release. Prosecutors said Wu, 26, threatened to chop off the hands of a Chinese pro-democracy activist known as 'Zooey,' a pseudonym that the Berklee student has used to avoid retaliation. Wu threatened to report Zooey’s family to Chinese police and asked others to find out where she lived. He also published Zooey’s email address. Two of Zooey's friends told VOA Mandarin on Wednesday that Zooey learned from prosecutors in September that Wu had been released and reciprocally exchanged for Lin. The two friends, who requested anonymity, citing security concerns, said Zooey was shocked and puzzled by this and worried about her safety. One of Zooey's friends said he received a threatening message from Wu on Instagram a few days ago. The message said: 'Do you really think that I won't be able to find you if you wear a mask and change your voice on Voice of America?' Another friend said that Wu recently posted a video of himself playing guitar on WeChat, China’s biggest social media platform. The location indicated it was published in Beijing. Zhou Fengsuo, a former student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement in China and co-founder of the NGO Humanitarian China, told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview that while Wu had gotten off easy, his case may serve as a deterrent against future similar cases. 'This is a very important case. We have observed that the Chinese pro-CCP nationalists have been restrained a lot on American campuses,' Zhou said. 'I have participated in activities in many American universities this year and have not encountered any of these people. I believe this has a lot to do with Wu’s conviction. Of course, his early release is not the result we want to see.' Zhou also said that if Wu's release is indeed part of an exchange for David Lin, it could mean that Wu has certain connections in China. He also told VOA Mandarin the swap is still beneficial. 'Pastor David Lin was detained in China for a very long time, so it is still very precious to exchange for his return,' Zhou said. VOA was unable to independently confirm whether Wu's early release was directly related to the release of Lin. VOA contacted the U.S. State Department and the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's Office in charge of Wu's case but has yet to receive a response. The White House declined to comment to VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-student-convicted-in-us-returned-to-china-/7846888.html	2024-10-31T17:20:05-07:00	
Germany closes 3 Iranian consulates following Iran's execution of German Iranian national	Germany will close three Iranian consulates in response to Iran’s announcement of the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a German Iranian national and a U.S. resident, earlier this week. 'We have repeatedly and unequivocally made it clear to Tehran that the execution of a German citizen will have serious consequences,' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Thursday in announcing the closure of the consulates in Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg. Germany will allow Iran’s embassy in Berlin to remain open. And Germany will 'continue to maintain our diplomatic channels and our embassy in Tehran,' Baerbock said. 'The fact that this assassination took place in the light of the latest developments in the Middle East shows that [Iran's] dictatorial, unjust regime ... does not act according to normal diplomatic logic,' she said. 'It is not without reason that our diplomatic relations are already at an all-time low.' Sharmahd, 69, was accused of a role in the deadly bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in 2008. He was convicted of the capital offense of 'corruption on Earth,' a term Iranian authorities use to refer to a broad range of offenses, including those related to Islamic morals. His family has denied the charges against him. In an exclusive interview with VOA’s Persian Service, Sharmahd’s daughter Ghazaleh Sharmahd warned that her father's execution on Monday would not silence the movement for justice. 'They made a huge mistake, thinking that by killing my father and the people of Iran, these movements would end. But they were wrong — killing only makes these movements stronger, more intense and more energized. ... The Islamic Republic made a huge mistake,' she said. Ghazaleh Sharmahd also said she is seeking the truth of her father’s death. She told VOA that the Islamic Republic informed the U.S. and Germany about her father’s death. 'They accept the words of terrorists and send me their condolences?' she said. 'They have a duty to investigate what really happened.' VOA’s Persian Service contributed to this report.

Russia fines Google $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000	Russia has fined Google an amount larger than the entire world's gross domestic product over restricting Russian propaganda channels on YouTube. Russian business newspaper RBC reported this week that legal claims brought by 17 Russian TV channels against Google in Russian courts, which have imposed compound fines on Google, had reached $20 decillion — an incomprehensible sum with 34 zeros. By comparison, the International Monetary Fund estimates the world's total gross domestic product to be $110 trillion. Google's parent company Alphabet, meanwhile, has a market value of around $2 trillion. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov admitted to reporters that he 'can't even pronounce this figure right.' But he said the fine was 'filled with symbolism.' 'Google should not restrict the activities of our broadcasters, and Google is doing this,' he said. The Russian state-run outlet Tass reported this week that a Russian court had previously ordered Google to restore the blocked YouTube channels or face rising charges. The fine has grown so high because it doubles every week. Earlier this year, Russia experienced a mass YouTube outage in August. The platform is considered one of the few remaining sites where audiences can access independent information in Russia, where Moscow blocks independent news sites and press freedom has all but disappeared. Google did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-fines-google-20-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000/7846846.html	2024-10-31T15:58:46-07:00	
US: 8,000 N. Korean troops expected to join Ukraine fight 'in coming days'	state department — Most of the North Korean troops sent to Russia are now deployed near the Ukrainian border and are expected to join the fight against Ukraine 'in the coming days,' according to top U.S. and South Korean diplomats and military officials. 'We now assess that there are some 10,000 North Korean soldiers in total in Russia, and the most recent information indicates that as many as 8,000 of those North Korean forces have been deployed to the Kursk region,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin co-hosted South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun in Washington on Thursday to discuss pressing security threats as they closely monitor North Korea's deployment of thousands of troops to Russia. 'Our assessment is that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's forces have trained these North Korean soldiers in artillery operations, UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] operations and basic infantry operations,' Austin said during a joint press conference. He also noted that Putin has provided the North Korean troops with Russian 'uniforms and equipment,' and 'all of that strongly indicates that Russia intends to use these foreign forces in front-line operations in its war of choice against Ukraine,' Austin added. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, over half a million Russian troops have been killed or wounded, according to U.S. officials. Facing an estimated 1,200 casualties daily, Russia is now turning to North Korea, a pariah state, to bolster its forces. While Russia has used foreign volunteers and mercenaries in the Ukraine war, the current deployment marks the first time in 100 years that Russia has invited regular forces of another nation onto its soil. Should these North Korean troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets, U.S. officials said. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is in talks with North Korea to deploy a 'large number of civilians' to work at Russian weapons production facilities. Zelenskyy said he plans to discuss air defense assistance with South Korea. Western nations have also expressed concerns about what North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs. No evidence of Russian technology Earlier Thursday, North Korea test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time in nearly a year, demonstrating a potential advancement in its ability to launch long-range nuclear attacks on the mainland U.S. It prompted swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States, which accused Pyongyang of raising tensions and risking the destabilization of regional security. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated through a spokesperson that North Korea's missile launches using ballistic technology violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea announced it would impose new sanctions on North Korea, including export controls on materials essential for producing solid-fuel missiles. 'It’s very early in our assessment phase, and we don't see any indication at this point that there was Russian involvement,' said Austin. Meanwhile, visiting South Korean officials in Washington noted that, although they cannot confirm Russian technical support in North Korea's latest ICBM launch, they remain concerned about the potential transfer of technology and arms from Russia to North Korea. Through a translator, Foreign Minister Cho told reporters, 'We also need to watch what kind of quid pro quo the DPRK will receive from Russia' before deciding on weapons support to Ukraine. 'Currently, we're not in a position to share the specifics,' he added. Cho was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. The South Korean government indicated it would consider sending 'weapons for defense and attack' and may also dispatch military and intelligence personnel to Ukraine to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and assist in interrogations of captured North Koreans. U.S. officials said additional security assistance for Ukraine will be announced soon, with continued support from over 50 countries to strengthen Ukraine's defense in the coming months. China’s silence Washington and Seoul also urged Beijing to use its influence over Pyongyang to curb North Korea’s provocative activities. This week, senior U.S. officials engaged in 'a robust conversation' with Chinese officials, according to Blinken. He voiced alarm about Russia's possible efforts to strengthen North Korea's military capabilities, which 'should be a real concern to China because it's profoundly destabilizing in the region.' Through a translator, Defense Minister Kim told reporters, 'China still continues to be silent,' noting that a clearer assessment is that Beijing is watching and waiting. However, if the situation worsens, China may intervene, either as a mediator or in some other capacity. 'There will be a point where the interests of China will be violated, and it is at that point that China will begin to play a certain role,' Kim added. Domestic instability Some experts suggest that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is facing domestic instability. Although he has managed to alleviate some of these issues by securing money and food from Russia through the sale of munitions, his dwindling stockpiles have led him to shift to selling soldiers as a new source of revenue. 'The Russians are running 1,200 casualties a day in their fight in Ukraine,' said Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. 'If they use the North Koreans the same way — likely they will — there are going to be massive casualties in the North Korean forces.' 'This is a really dire development for the [North Korean] families whose kids have been sent to Ukraine. There could be some real instability that's generated by his action,' Bennett told VOA. VOA reporter Kim Lewis contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-8-000-n-korean-troops-expected-to-join-ukraine-fight-in-coming-days-/7846858.html	2024-10-31T15:55:22-07:00	
Thousands of passenger flight signals jammed over war zones in Ukraine, Middle East	The navigation systems of thousands of passenger aircraft are being disrupted every day as they fly close to conflict zones, according to researchers, who warn that the blocking or spoofing technology could one day put lives at risk. There has been a big increase over the past two years in the use of electronic warfare technology, which is frequently used to disrupt drones or missiles that use global positioning system or other satellite navigation technology to home in on their targets. However, the blocking or spoofing of GPS signals also affects commercial aircraft, explained Raphael Monstein, a research associate at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. 'Spoofing is when an actor sends out malicious signals to all the receivers that are in the coverage area. And it tricks the receiver into believing that it is in a different position than it actually is. And particularly in aviation, that has quite some consequences, which can be quite negative,' he told VOA. 'It has a lot of side effects in the cockpit, and they can range from spurious warnings — obviously the loss of situational awareness because you're not quite sure when your GPS indicates you're somewhere else. You can have very different reactions of the aircraft, depending a bit on the aircraft type,' Monstein said. Conflict zones Monstein and his team in Zurich track GPS interference of civilian aircraft in real time and publish it on an online map. They have detected a big increase in such incidents since the beginning of the year. 'And they are mainly around conflict zones. One of them would be the Middle East. One would be the Black Sea and around Russia,' he said. 'We talk about on an average day about 1,000 aircraft at least being affected by that. And that is a very big scale. That is novel. We haven't seen that kind of [interference] anywhere in the world so far.' Commercial aircraft The disruption isn’t only happening above war zones. In April, Finnair, Finland’s national carrier, suspended flights to Tartu in eastern Estonia near Russia after GPS disruptions prevented two aircraft from landing at the airport. Finnair resumed the flights in June after the airport installed navigation systems that do not rely on GPS. Experts say most airports have such alternative equipment already installed. Finnair previously reported similar problems when flying close to the Finland-Russia border and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The interference began in 2022, the year Finland applied to join NATO, after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February of that year. At the time, Estonia’s defense minister said it was a deliberate Russian tactic. 'We all understand that these hybrid attacks are still very acute. We have to be ready also for these,' Hanno Pevkur told reporters on May 15. Russia denies seeking to disrupt GPS signals of commercial aircraft. Passenger dangers How dangerous is GPS disruption for air travelers? 'It's not that an aircraft is going to fall out of the sky because it loses its GPS signal,' Monstein explained. 'There are a lot of systems in aviation that were built in for a reason, and one of them is, for example, the ground proximity warning system. And if you have to deselect that one because it gives you spurious warnings, it chips away on the safety margins, and that is not good. And in the long run, there can be a high risk for something to happen,' he added. GPS blocking and spoofing also affects navigation systems on the ground. Residents of Moscow have recently complained of malfunctioning smartphone applications, such as map, taxi-hailing or food delivery apps. Experts have linked the disruption to Russian attempts to defend against Ukrainian drone attacks. Moscow has not commented on the issue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-of-passenger-flight-signals-jammed-over-war-zones-in-ukraine-middle-east-/7846589.html	2024-10-31T15:07:24-07:00

Anti-China sentiment said to be growing in Myanmar	bangkok — A recent attack on a Chinese consulate in Myanmar reflects growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the country fed by Beijing's support of the ruling junta, experts say. On October 18, the Chinese consulate in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, was struck by a small explosive device. Reports say the building was damaged but there were no casualties. It was the first attack was on a Chinese diplomatic facility in Myanmar since anti-China riots in Yangon in 1967. In a statement to journalists, the nation's military authorities said the blast damaged tiles on the roof of the two-story building and that they were seeking to identify and arrest the 'terrorists' who were responsible. Two weeks later, no one has been caught and no group has claimed responsibility, but anti-China sentiment exists, experts say. Ye Myo Hein, a visiting senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace and global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said strong anti-China sentiment has been brewing since Myanmar's military seized power on February 1, 2021. 'Immediately following the coup, the public perceived China as supportive of the junta, resulting in strong anti-Chinese sentiment among the general population,' he told VOA. Anti-Chinese sentiment grows Myanmar has been in chaos since General Min Aung Hlaing and his military forces overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Backers of the ousted government have joined forces with various ethnic armies to resist the junta's rule. China distanced itself from the junta for a time, but recently renewed its support. When it did, Ye Myo Hein said, anti-Chinese sentiment began to rise again. 'It is difficult to determine who was responsible for the attacks on the Chinese consulate, but if China continues its pro-junta stance, it will likely face growing public animosity,' he said. The military has been sanctioned and condemned by the U.S. and Western countries, but it has retained some support from countries such as China and Russia. 'Whoever was behind the consulate bombing, it suggests that there are multiple strands of anti-Chinese anger, against the support for the regime and against the perceived support of China for the Kokang occupation of Lashio,' David Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst with more than two decades of experience focusing on Myanmar, told VOA. Kokang, which is in northern Myanmar's Shan State, sits on the border with China. It is home to 90% ethnic Chinese and is an important trade route between the two countries. In the past year, three allied pro-democracy ethnic groups have captured the city from Myanmar military forces. Beijing negotiated a cease-fire between the allied brotherhood and the junta in January but it was short-lived. China did succeed in getting the ethnic groups to assist in a crackdown on Chinese crime rings in northern Shan state that had been targeting Chinese citizens with online scams. China now appears to be backing both sides of the conflict. But with rebel forces capturing more territory over the past year, Beijing is showing its concern over the rapid deterioration of the junta's position. In late July, after ethnic groups captured Lashio, a town in the northeast, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyitaw. China also recently closed its borderlands and key trade routes under the control of Myanmar's rebel groups, Reuters reported. One Chinese national who lives in Myanmar told VOA's Mandarin Service that he believes the consulate attack was not a terrorist incident, but an expression of dissatisfaction with China. He added that since the coup, there have been protests against China's government in various parts of Myanmar. In March 2021, several Chinese factories in Myanmar were burned and destroyed during mass protests against the coup. 'China has to take this rising public anger very seriously, as it could potentially descend into violence in urban areas and against Chinese nationals and economic assets, but also Myanmar-Chinese communities as well,' Mathieson told VOA this week. 'Has Beijing really thought through all these dilemmas? Or is its cynically arrogant support for the SAC at such levels the Chinese leadership don't care about consequences?' The SAC is short for the State Administration Council, a reference to the junta. History of supporting military Over the last three decades, Beijing has supplied the Myanmar military with major arms. The military has used those arms to crush those opposing their rule, with nearly 6,000 people killed, according to rights groups. China is also Myanmar's biggest trade partner and has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector. 'Since the junta is widely despised, Beijing's support for it will almost certainly fuel anti-Chinese sentiment,' Ye Myo Hein said. Nevertheless, diplomacy is continuing between the two regimes, as Myanmar junta boss Min Aung Hlaing is expected to pay a return visit to China in November.

UN warns global hunger hot spots growing	new york — A new U.N. report warned Thursday that conflict, climate and economic stress are driving severe hunger and in some cases famine conditions, in 22 countries and territories, with no likelihood for improvement in the next six months. 'So, you have conflict impacts, climate impacts in the same countries, as well as both the combination of the two turns into economic devastation for people,' Arif Husain, chief economist of the World Food Program, said of the main drivers of the hunger crises to reporters in a video briefing. The situation is most severe in the Gaza Strip, Sudan, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali, where millions of people are in the highest levels of food insecurity, meaning famine, risk of famine or starvation are happening. In Gaza, U.N. food agencies have been warning about the critical situation for months. It is fueled by the nearly 13-month war between Israel and Hamas, which has made it dangerous and difficult for humanitarians to get food and other assistance to about 2 million Palestinians trapped in the crossfire. WFP’s Husain said 91% of Gazans are at crisis levels or worse for hunger, with about 345,000 of them in faminelike conditions. 'And the report says basically that there is a risk — there's a persistent risk — of famine for the entire Gaza Strip,' Husain said. The situation in Sudan is even worse because the numbers of people are dramatically higher. 'Time is running out to save lives,' Rein Paulsen, director of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Office of Emergencies and Resilience, told reporters of Sudan. 'People are facing total collapse of livelihoods and starvation in areas where conflict is hitting the hardest across the country, including in Darfur, in Jazira, in Khartoum and in Kordofan,' he said. Paulsen noted that famine levels of food insecurity were reported two months ago in the Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where several hundred thousand internally displaced people are sheltering. Fighting has escalated in recent months in that region between the army and a rival paramilitary group. 'And those famine conditions are likely — highly likely — to persist unless something changes,' he said. In the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is in the grip of a serious hunger crisis because of the rampant violence from armed gangs whose kidnappings, killings, rapes and looting have left Haitians in the capital and some outlying areas afraid to leave their homes. Two million people do not have enough to eat, and about 6,000 of them are experiencing famine levels of food insecurity, Paulsen said. 'Immediate action is imperative to save lives, to prevent starvation, and to help vulnerable populations restore their livelihoods amidst unprecedented violence and displacement,' he added. In Africa, Mali and South Sudan are also at the top of the list of hunger hot spots. WFP’s Husain said about 2,500 people are at catastrophic or famine levels of hunger in Mali and another 121,000 are right behind them. In South Sudan, affected by the war in Sudan and severe flooding, the number of people facing starvation and death was projected in the report to nearly double between April and July to 2.3 million, compared with the same period in 2023. Hunger is expected to worsen when the next lean season begins in May. A step behind these most affected countries are those of 'very high concern' for humanitarians, including Chad, Lebanon, Myanmar, Mozambique, Nigeria, Syria and Yemen. 'These are classified and categorized in this context where we have a high number of people facing particular acute food insecurity, and where we also see drivers that are expected to further intensify life-threatening conditions in the coming months,' Paulsen said. Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and Niger are new to the list of hunger hot spots this year, joining Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, Zambia and Zimbabwe to round out the list. WFP’s Husain said humanitarians need both resources and safe access to assist the millions of people in need to bring the high rates of hunger and malnutrition down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-global-hunger-hot-spots-growing/7846797.html	2024-10-31T14:35:03-07:00	
Residents in Ethiopia’s Oromia region report network disruptions as government forces fight rebels	ADAMA, ETHIOPIA — Residents in Ethiopia’s Oromia region say access to phone communication and internet service has been disrupted for months as government forces fight against two rebel groups. The disruption of mobile phone calls and internet data has been concentrated in conflict-hit Oromia zones, where government forces have engaged in fighting against the Oromo Liberation Army, or the OLA. A resident from South Oromia of Guji Zone Wadera Wereda, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for safety reasons, said phone and internet data connections have been cut in his area due to the fighting. He said there was fighting on Monday and the week before in Wadera Wereda, where regional security personnel including local police were killed. Other residents confirmed the same clashes without giving specific casualty figures. Local authorities could not be reached for comment. The data outage and network disruptions were also reported in the North Shewa Zone administration of Oromia region. 'The zone has been under network blockade for the last two months due to the insurgency,' said a second resident from Dera Wereda in North Shewa, who also sought anonymity due to safety reasons. Residents also said people who lost their SIM cards or want replacements could not do so at local telecom offices because the conflict has affected supplies. Network disruptions also impacted schools in the area that access materials online. He says his school had to transfer all its grade-12 students this year to neighboring Wereda due to a lack of service. 'We cannot manage to send their details and credentials to relevant bodies,' with the downed service, he told VOA in a phone interview. Journalists have waited for hours to speak to residents in Kelem Welega Zone, whose network is down during morning hours. One resident traveled to Dembi Dolo, about 620 kilometers west of the capital, Addis Ababa, to speak with the media about the network outages. The disruptions have been present since the yearslong fighting between federal forces and the OLA began in 2019. In one of the latest deadliest attacks, suspected OLA fighters killed as many as 17 pro-government militiamen in the West Showa zone of Oromia on October 17, according to residents and local officials. A second rebel group, Fano, is also fighting in the neighboring Amhara region, which spills over on either side. Residents say as the intensity of the clashes increases, the network situation becomes worse, as the government resorts to shutting down communication. 'It's a very unfortunate tactic that is usually used by governments that are struggling with legitimacy issues,' said Horn of Africa security analyst Samira Gaid. 'It only serves to convince the masses that the government has something to hide. Rather than controlling the narrative or news reporting, it elevates mistrust in government, adds to misinformation and disinformation, and contributes to groups becoming more covert with their communications,' she told VOA. Ethiopia’s state-run communication outlets have not responded to repeated VOA requests for comment. Speaking at a press conference in Addis Ababa last month, Frehiwot Tamiru, CEO of Ethio Telecom, admitted that such problems exist in conflict areas. She declined to give specific answers, referring reporters to other government entities. In June, the company said it has repaired and restored service to dozens of mobile stations that had previously been damaged in the western region of the country.

Harris, Trump trade barbs over treatment of women	U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump sparred over how women should be treated in society as they looked for votes Thursday in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest political battleground states. Polling shows Harris, the Democratic candidate, and Trump, the Republican candidate, are virtually tied in the two states. Arizona and Nevada are among seven closely contested states across the 50-state country that are likely to determine the national outcome in next Tuesday’s election. In the other 43, polling shows Trump or Harris with either decisive or comfortable leads. Appeals to Latino voters are central to the campaigns in both Arizona and Nevada. Trump won Arizona in his successful 2016 campaign for the presidency but lost it to President Joe Biden in 2020. Democrats won Nevada in both elections. Migrants crossing from Mexico into the United States across the border in Arizona are at the center of the political debate in the state. Trump has pledged to finish the border wall he started during his 2017-2021 White House tenure. He has also vowed to round up and deport undocumented migrants living in the U.S., while accusing Harris of being weak on controlling the influx of migrants. Harris has said she will look to enact legislation calling for tougher asylum rules at U.S. entry points to curb the tens of thousands of migrants crossing into the U.S. She supports an immigration bill drafted by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators that Trump leaned on Republican lawmakers to kill earlier this year. Pop icon Jennifer Lopez is to join Harris on stage Thursday night at a rally in Las Vegas, the U.S. gambling mecca. Trump has scheduled an interview in Arizona with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson and a rally in neighboring Nevada. Harris and Trump met only once face to face in a debate, but trade insults and taunts every day from rally stages, in campaign ads and over the airwaves. Their latest dispute is over the treatment of women. Trump said at a rally on Wednesday in the Midwest state of Wisconsin that he would protect American women 'whether the women like it or not.' He cast the remark as paternal, but it served to remind his critics of his history of misogynistic statements and a civil court case that found him liable for sexual abuse of a New York writer in the 1990s. Trump told supporters that his advisers had urged him to stop proclaiming his desire to protect women, saying they had called it 'inappropriate.' But he told rally-goers, 'I said, ‘Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.’' Polls show Harris with a wide lead among female voters; Trump substantially leads with men. Harris quickly jumped on Trump’s remark, writing on X, 'Donald Trump thinks he should get to make decisions about what you do with your body. Whether you like it or not.' On Thursday, she said that Trump’s views on women showed that he does not understand 'their rights and their ability to make decisions about their own lives.' Nearly 62 million people have already voted at polling stations or by mail. More than 155 million voted in the 2020 election, about two-thirds of them early or by mail and a third of them on the official Election Day. The importance of battleground states like Arizona, Nevada and the five others cannot be overstated. U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50 state-by-state contests, with 48 of the states awarding all their electoral votes to the winner in that state. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs by both statewide and congressional district vote counts. The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population, so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall national outcome, with the winner needing 270 of the 538 electoral votes to claim the presidency. Polls show either Harris or Trump with substantial or comfortable leads in 43 of the states, enough for each to get to 200 electoral votes or more. Barring an upset in one of those states, the winner will be decided in the remaining seven states, where both Harris and Trump have staged frequent rallies, all but ignoring the rest of the country for campaign stops. Polling in the seven states is easily within the margins of statistical error, leaving the outcome in doubt in all seven.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-trade-barbs-over-the-treatment-of-women-/7846803.html	2024-10-31T14:31:43-07:00

Accused of interference in Georgia, Russia pumps up anti-US propaganda	Tbilisi and Moscow have exchanged harsh rhetoric about the results of the October 26 parliamentary elections in Georgia that brought thousands to the streets protesting the victory of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili, who is aligned with the pro-Western opposition, accused Russia of running a 'special operation' to 'falsify' the election results in favor of the ruling party, which is widely seen as increasingly pro-Kremlin and authoritarian. In response, Russia denied involvement and framed the United States and European Union as destabilizing powers. In doing so, Moscow’s network of officials and state-owned outlets engaged in disinformation and conspiracy theories, going so far as to allege on a state-controlled news agency that the U.S. and Ukraine were secretly deploying snipers to shoot at protesters in Tbilisi to escalate the situation. Zourabichvili also told Reuters that Russian 'methodology and the support of most probably Russian FSB [Federal Security Service] types is shown in this election.' 'The propaganda that was used ahead of the election ... was a direct duplication, a copy-paste, of Russian clips and videos used at the time of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's election,' said Zourabichvili, whose position as president is largely ceremonial. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian interference in the election and accused Zourabichvili of 'attempting to destabilize the situation.' Peskov had earlier alleged it was the European countries that 'tried to influence the outcome of this vote.' Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called Zourabichvili a 'puppet president' who 'refused to accept the election and went against the Constitution by calling for a coup.' 'The standard practice in such cases is removal from office and arrest,' Medvedev wrote on X. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the U.S. of engaging in 'neo-colonialism' after U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller warned the Georgian government could face 'consequences' if it did not 'walk back its anti-democratic actions and return to its Euro-Atlantic path.' Russian state media went further, spreading a conspiracy theory that the West was seeking to foment violence in Georgia. 'In their attempts to knock off balance the internal political situation in Georgia following the October 26 election and set off another color revolution, Westerners stop at nothing,' the Russian state-owned Sputnik news agency said, quoting unnamed 'sources in the region.' 'Ukraine-trained snipers are arriving in the republic to organize provocations during mass protests,' Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency reported Monday, citing a 'regional official familiar with the matter.' The term 'color revolution' was widely adopted after the 2004-05 Orange Revolution in Ukraine was sparked by a corruption-ridden presidential runoff that saw the pro-Russian candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, emerge victorious. Russia typically uses the term when accusing the West of orchestrating movements to destabilize or overthrow Kremlin-preferred governments. In the months leading up to Georgia’s parliamentary poll, Russian state media ran reports alleging the U.S. was seeking to foment a color revolution or 'a Ukraine-style coup.' In July, Russia’s state-run Sputnik news agency cited an anonymous Russian intelligence official who claimed U.S. authorities were planning a 'sacred sacrifice' from among the protest participants. The disinformation narrative in Sputnik’s report reflects a well-worn Kremlin conspiracy theory going back to the 2013-14 pro-Europe rallies in Ukraine, when the Russians claimed that American-trained Georgian 'mercenaries' were responsible for shooting protesters in Kyiv during the 2014 demonstrations at the city’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, widely known as the Maidan or Independence Square. Russian state media and top officials, including Putin, falsely claimed that the U.S. organized protests in Ukraine to propagate a coup. That narrative included a conspiracy theory that Victoria Nuland, an American diplomat and former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, had ordered 'American specialists' to lead the 'snipers, who shot people at the Maidan.' Amid ongoing protests in Georgia, the U.S. and the EU have joined calls from international and local observers to investigate alleged election-related violations. On Thursday, Georgian authorities launched an investigation into election-fraud allegations. The EU and U.S. have repeatedly warned Georgia about what they call its 'democratic backsliding,' even freezing financial support to the country’s government, focusing instead on supporting civil society initiatives. In June, Georgian Dream officials signed into law a bill that required nongovernmental agencies receiving at least 20% of their funding from abroad to label themselves as foreign agents 'pursuing the interests of a foreign power.' In response, Brussels paused Georgia’s accession process to the EU, saying the foreign agent law is incompatible with EU membership. Georgia’s opposition has nicknamed Tbilisi’s new foreign agent law the 'Russian law,' a reference to similar legislation enacted in Russia in 2012 that has been used to silence civil society and independent media. The EU also warned it may freeze visa-free travel with Georgia if it finds the parliamentary poll neither free nor fair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/accused-of-interference-in-georgia-russia-pumps-up-anti-us-propaganda-/7846721.html	2024-10-31T13:09:01-07:00	
Hundreds in Turkey protest arrest, ouster of opposition mayor	ISTANBUL — Hundreds gathered Thursday in Istanbul to protest the arrest and removal from office of a mayor from Turkey's main opposition party for his alleged links to a banned Kurdish militant group. Ahmet Ozer, mayor of Istanbul's Esenyurt district and a member of the Republican People's Party, or CHP, was detained on Wednesday by anti-terrorist police over his alleged connection to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Turkey's government on Thursday replaced Ozer with Istanbul's deputy governor, a move the CHP's leader, Ozgur Ozel and other politicians described as a 'coup.' The mayor's arrest comes as Turkey is debating a tentative peace process to end a 40-year conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state that has led to tens of thousands of deaths. Demonstrators filled a square in Esenyurt after the government banned a rally outside the municipality building. Some carried banners that read: '(We want) an elected mayor not an appointed mayor' and called for the resignation of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. 'In our view, this (government), which acts against the law and violates the constitution, has carried out a political coup. We will never accept it,' said Tulay Hatimogullari, the leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party, whose supporters joined the rally in a show of solidarity. Ozel, whose CHP made significant gains in local elections earlier this year, called for early elections. Ozer, 64, is a former academic originally from Van in eastern Turkey. He was elected mayor of Esenyurt, a western suburb in Istanbul's European side, in March local elections. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said an investigation found Ozer had maintained contacts with PKK figures for more than 10 years, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Politicians and members of Turkey's pro-Kurdish movement have frequently been targeted over alleged links to the PKK, which is considered a terror organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Legislators have been stripped of their parliamentary seats and mayors removed from office. Several lawmakers as well as thousands of party members have been jailed on terror-related charges since 2016. Other opposition parties have been largely unscathed but the CHP metropolitan mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, is currently appealing a prison sentence and political ban imposed by a court in December 2022 for 'insulting' members of Turkey's election board in 2019. Imamoglu accused Erdogan's government of 'plotting a dirty game' to snatch Esenyurt municipality away from the opposition 'by declaring [Ozer] a terrorist for fictitious reasons.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-in-turkey-protest-arrest-and-ouster-of-opposition-mayor/7846538.html	2024-10-31T10:46:53-07:00	
Hungary's Orban finds key ally in Georgia amid Western concerns	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Standing side by side with Georgia's prime minister, Hungary's Viktor Orban was among the first to congratulate the ruling Georgian Dream party on its recent electoral victory. This endorsement came as much of the Western world raised questions about the legitimacy of the election and tens of thousands of Georgians were in the streets to protest it. Orban's swift acknowledgment underscored his bond with Georgia's government. 'I congratulate the prime minister on his election victory,' Orban declared, adding, 'I see that nobody dares to question that this election was a free and democratic choice.' For many observers, this alliance was hardly surprising. Both leaders have shown authoritarian tendencies in their governance styles, said Irakli Porchkhidze, senior fellow at the Georgian Institute for Strategic Studies. 'They reinforce each other's positions,' he told VOA. Orban's enthusiastic embrace of the Georgian Dream victory stands in contrast to the stance of the European Union, which expressed concerns over the election's fairness. The EU noted that Orban was not speaking on its behalf. Analysts argue that the alliance between Orban and Georgia's ruling party is not based on any ideological commitment but rather on mutual convenience. Aka Zarqua, editor-in-chief of Realpolitik, described it to VOA as 'a marriage of convenience between two autocrats.' Hungary has reportedly lobbied against EU sanctions on Georgia's leadership and pushed Brussels to grant Tbilisi EU candidate status ahead of the elections. Notably, in 2012, Orban stood next to then-President Mikheil Saakashvili in Georgia, who is now Georgian Dream's chief adversary. 'As a Hungarian friend, believe me — don't go back. ... I would like to ask you to keep your country on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration,' Orban said on October 27, 2012, standing next to Saakashvili. That year, Saakashvili lost the elections, and Georgian Dream came to power. 'That was a different Orban,' Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA in a phone call. Twelve years later, when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, EU and NATO members criticized Orban for his determination to remain friendly with Russia, something Georgia's ruling party has also done. Hungary, under Orban's leadership, has become a template for Georgia's leaders as they seek to consolidate power while maintaining the appearance of democracy, Zarqua said. 'One of them is leading, offering lessons to [former Prime Minister Bidzina] Ivanishvili and his Georgian Dream party on how to control civil society and establish what political scientists call competitive authoritarianism,' Zarqua said. Georgian Dream's ties to Russia have been widely discussed, with Rohac referring to the party as 'Russia's fifth column' in Georgia, underscoring the growing perception that Georgian leadership is aligning itself with Moscow. '[Georgian Dream] is a political force that has dragged Georgia into Russian and, to a lesser extent, Chinese spheres of influence. And Viktor Orban, since his transformation, since 2010, has been doing the same for Hungary,' Rohac said. Pro-Russian narratives have increasingly shaped Georgian politics, much like Hungary under Orban. Both governments have cast themselves as challengers to Western liberalism, amplifying Kremlin talking points to rally domestic support. They've also enacted Russian-inspired foreign agent laws to target foreign-funded organizations, a tactic critics see as a way to silence opposition. 'They have copied each other in how they manage elections,' Porchkhidze said. 'They are hostile toward the dissent. Let it be the opposition, media or civil society organizations,' he said. However, the differences are significant. Hungary is already a member of NATO and the European Union, providing it with a certain degree of protection and a security umbrella. 'It's much more dangerous for Georgian society to follow these tendencies than it is for Hungarian society,' Zarqua cautioned. Hungary and Georgia have experienced Russian aggression — Hungary during the Soviet crackdown of 1956 and Georgia in the 1990s and again in 2008, with Russian forces still occupying 20% of Georgia's territory. Both countries have since invoked these fears, warning of potential Russian threats if they lose power. 'They are exploiting the trauma of Russia's aggression,' Zarqua said, calling it 'just political technology.' Orban’s Fidesz party and the Georgian Dream party have also tapped into anti-Western narratives that have gained traction across Europe. The rhetoric often centers on portraying the West as decadent and in decline, a narrative that finds strong echoes in Russian propaganda. 'There's a common thread running through the messaging of Russian propaganda, Georgian Dream and Orban — that the West is decadent, and these countries should place their bets elsewhere rather than in the West,' Rohac said. This anti-Western sentiment is often couched in the language of 'traditional values' and opposition to LGBTQ rights, a tactic aimed at appealing to domestic audiences, said the AEI’s Rohac. 'For Orban, the most important consideration is staying in power,' Rohac said. 'Sometimes that means turning against LGBTQ rights. Georgian Dream is doing the same. I don't think this really reflects a deep commitment to cultural conservatism.' The West's lack of a coherent strategy for the post-Soviet space has also contributed to the rise of leaders like Orban and their allies, Zarqua said. 'The West is not as attractive as it was during the unipolar moment of the 1990s and 2000s,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hungarys-orban-finds-key-ally-in-georgia-amid-western-concerns/7846516.html	2024-10-31T10:44:54-07:00

Kenyan court lifts orders blocking swearing-in of deputy president nominee	Nairobi, Kenya — A Kenyan court has lifted orders blocking the swearing-in of Deputy President nominee Kithuri Kindiki — dealing a blow to former DP Rigathi Gachagua who was impeached and removed from office in mid-October amid accusations of gross misconduct and undermining the president. Gachagua's lawyers filed about 30 court cases arguing against his ouster in the last two weeks. The three-judge bench appointed to hear the case by the deputy chief justice, made the highly anticipated announcement Thursday. 'Public interest in this matter favors giving way to the constitution, which in any event is the will of the people,' said Judge Antony Mrima, who heard the case along with Eric Ogola and Freda Mugambi. 'We choose to abide by that calling, as such public interest demands that the office of the deputy president should not remain vacant.' President William Ruto, who had 14 days after Gachagua removal to replace him, took less than a day to nominate Interior Minister Kindiki. The selection was approved by lawmakers at the National Assembly a few hours later. However, the court suspended any further action until it could hear the case. Since then, the three-judge bench has faced questions and petitions from Gachagua's lawyers contesting the validity of their appointment and their own impartiality. Those challenges were rejected. Gachagua was convicted on five of the 11 charges against him, which included accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth and undermining the president. Gachagua denied all the charges. Public opinion has been mixed, with some telling VOA they agree with the removal of Gachagua while others found it distasteful, especially because the deputy president fell ill while the proceedings were happening. 'The outgoing deputy president was too abrasive. He couldn't tone down his language. He seemed divisive,' said James Chege. 'It wasn't good, especially when you are impeaching someone who's in the hospital. It was so untimely,' Edwin Mugalo said. Gachagua was Ruto's running mate in the 2022 election but had recently complained of about being left out, highlighting the friction and tension between him and his former boss. Kenneth Ombongi said he was surprised the Ruto-Gachagua partnership lasted as long as it did. Ombongi is the former chair of the department of history and archeology and is now associate dean of postgraduate studies at the University of Nairobi. 'If I look at historical patterns, what’s happening is not new and was expected. The office of the vice president or the deputy president has always been as delicate as it is now,' Ombongi said. 'The two are of the same characteristics … I know our president ... He's strong, determined, opinionated, same thing with Gachagua. We say two bulls cannot share the same corral.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-court-lifts-orders-blocking-swearing-in-of-deputy-president-nominee/7846440.html	2024-10-31T09:37:24-07:00	
Moroccan authorities detain human rights activist who accused government of 'blackmailing' France	RABAT, Morocco — A Moroccan economist known for his work defending human rights was detained after criticizing the government in remarks posted on social media during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the North African kingdom. Prosecutors apprehended Fouad Abdelmoumni in Casablanca on Wednesday and announced he was under investigation on suspicion of disseminating false information and accusing others of crimes on social media, Morocco's state news agency reported. If charged and convicted, he could face up to five years in prison under cybercrime statutes. 'This arbitrary arrest is part of a series of harassments targeting Abdelmoumni, as a measure aimed at retaliating against his bold positions in expressing his opinions and defending human rights,' the Moroccan Association in Support of Political Prisoners said in a statement Wednesday. 'This arrest represents a further escalation in the authorities' policy of repression against human rights and political activists in the country.' Abdelmoumni, a former political prisoner, is the group's coordinator. While Macron toured Rabat with Moroccan leaders including King Mohammed VI, the activist alleged in a post that Morocco was attempting to 'blackmail' France using methods including espionage and withholding cooperation on managing illegal immigration. Abdelmoumni is yet to be officially arraigned. When he appears in court on Friday, he will likely be charged with crimes related to the post, one of his attorneys, Souad Brahma, said. In Morocco, authorities can hold people under investigation for 48 hours without charging them. Brahma said Abdelmoumni was arrested for expressing his opinion and called his detention a violation of his right to freedom of expression. She said she was denied a chance to visit him on Thursday despite receiving authorization from the court. Officials have not responded to allegations that the arrest was politically motivated. Macron throughout his visit referred to opening a new chapter in relations between France and Morocco after years of strain. The causes of friction included the 2021 'Pegasus Affair,' in which Amnesty International and the Paris-based nonprofit group Forbidden Stories published a report alleging that Moroccan authorities had used the Israeli software Pegasus to infiltrate the electronic devices of human rights activists including Abdelmoumni and politicians all the way up to Macron. Morocco strenuously denied the allegations and sued, claiming defamation. Abdelmoumni, 66, has been prominent in defending human rights since he was imprisoned and tortured alongside other left-wing activists during King Hassan II's era of repression known as the 'Years of Lead.' He has publicly supported pro-democracy efforts in the country, including during the Arab Spring and Morocco's 2017 'Hirak' movement. After the investigation into Pegasus software, Abdelmoumni was among the activists profiled in a 2022 Human Rights Watch report on Morocco's targeting of critics. The report said an anonymous person distributed a video of him and his then-partner-now-wife having sex, likely shot from a hidden camera inside his home's air conditioner. In Morocco, non-marital sex is a crime and information about their relationship later appeared in pro-government media as part of an effort that Abdelmoumni said was designed to intimidate him. This week, he participated in a vigil demanding justice for a Moroccan nationalist who was 'disappeared' in France in 1965, and appeared at a courthouse where Morocco's ex-human rights minister was facing trial. He was going to a meeting of the Moroccan Association for the Support of Political Prisoners when he was apprehended. Macron's political party helped push through a 2023 resolution in the European Union's Parliament condemning human rights abuses in Morocco. But the two countries have recently deepened political and economic ties. This week, they announced economic agreements and lucrative contracts on projects ranging from transportation to desalination infrastructure, and Macron reiterated his support for Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara. During his three-day visit, Macron did not mention human rights in speeches at a business forum, to the country's French community or at the country's parliament.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moroccan-authorities-detain-human-rights-activist-who-accused-government-of-blackmailing-france/7846302.html	2024-10-31T08:40:16-07:00	
Analysts see Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel weakened	Recent attempts by Iran to establish deterrence through direct strikes on Israel have mainly failed, according to analysts, leaving the Islamic Republic more vulnerable to its prime foe. Israel’s recent retaliatory airstrikes on Iran are said to have dismantled all of Iran’s S-300 defense missile system. The strikes came in response to Iran's October 1 ballistic missile attacks against Israel. Iran says it is still assessing damage from the strikes. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy told VOA that the airstrikes showed Israel has 'the qualitative military edge when it comes to war with Iran,' impacting the Muslim nation’s deterrence strategy. 'They struck advanced S-300 anti-air systems — which allowed them to evade Iranian air defenses and sites that are important for building vehicles for intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as the fuel for ballistic missiles, which is a key component of Iran’s deterrent strategy,' Heras said. 'They fundamentally wanted to send a signal to the Iranians that the Iranians are far behind the Israelis when it comes to the tech war,' he said. Writing in the online Diwan publication, Nicole Grajewski, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace fellow in its nuclear program, said, 'Iran’s attempts to deter Israel through direct attacks have proven counterproductive, instead revealing gaps in its own defenses that Israel is increasingly willing to target … [and] likely places Iran in an even more precarious position than before October 1.' Thomas Newdick, writing in The War Zone, agreed. 'Putting the Iranian S-300s out of action leaves the door open to follow-up strikes by Israel, including larger scale direct attacks.' This, he said, 'serves as both a contingent opportunity for the Israel Defense Forces and a deterrent against a response from Iran.' 'It is almost inevitable that Israel has several follow-up options already planned should Iran respond with another barrage,' Newdick said. Another component of Iran’s deterrent strategy has been the development of relationships over the years with Syria as well as regional militant groups, including those in Iraq, Hamas in Gaza, Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. Israel assassinated Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, chief among them Yahya Sinwar and Hassan Nasrallah. Analyst Steven Simon of Washington’s Quincy Institute, during an online presentation, said there are many unknowns about Iran’s 'axis of resistance.' Simon questioned 'how much is left of this axis of resistance for advancing Iran’s objectives, let alone their own.' 'Hamas is destroyed, basically, as a military organization,' Simon said. 'Hezbollah has been very badly wounded. They took a serious beating: the pager attacks, the assassination of Nasrallah and [Hezbollah official Hashem] Safieddine, and others in their hierarchy. 'I don’t know how accurate the latest Israeli assessments are of the destruction they’ve inflicted on Hezbollah’s missile and rockets inventories,' he said, but 'they are now saying that 80% of those rockets and missiles have either been expended or destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.' Simon added that Hezbollah will find it difficult to replenish its Iranian arms supplies because Syria, as a conduit, is incapable of ensuring weapons can cross its borders into Lebanon. Carnegie’s Grajewski said she believes Iran’s response options are now 'severely constrained,' given the weakening of its proxy network and now that its own 'missile arsenal proved both limited in scope and questionable in its reliability.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-see-iran-s-deterrence-vis-a-vis-israel-weakened/7846212.html	2024-10-31T07:36:56-07:00	
Chinese online retailer Temu faces EU probe into rogue traders, illegal goods	LONDON — The European Union is investigating Chinese online retailer Temu over suspicions it's failing to prevent the sale of illegal products, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm said on Thursday. The European Commission opened its investigation five months after adding Temu to the list of 'very large online platforms' needing the strictest level of scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Services Act. It's a wide-ranging rulebook designed to clean up online platforms and keep internet users safe, with the threat of hefty fines. Temu started entering Western markets only in the past two years and has grown in popularity by offering cheap goods — from clothing to home products — that are shipped from sellers in China. The company, owned by Pinduoduo Incorporated, a popular e-commerce site in China, now has 92 million users in the EU. Temu said it 'takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform.' 'We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers,' the company said in a statement. European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said in a press release that Brussels wants to make sure products sold on Temu's platform 'meet EU standards and do not harm consumers.' EU enforcement will 'guarantee a level playing field and that every platform, including Temu, fully respects the laws that keep our European market safe and fair for all,' she said. The commission's investigation will look into whether Temu's systems are doing enough to crack down on 'rogue traders' selling 'noncompliant goods' amid concerns that they are able to swiftly reappear after being suspended. The commission didn't single out specific illegal products that were being sold on the platform. Regulators are also examining the risks from Temu's 'addictive design,' including 'game-like' reward programs, and what the company is doing to mitigate those risks. Also under investigation is Temu's compliance with two other DSA requirements: giving researchers access to data and transparency on recommender systems. Companies must detail how they recommend content and products and give users at least one option to see recommendations that are not based on their personal profile and preferences. Temu now has the chance to respond to the commission, which can decide to impose a fine or drop the case if the company makes changes or can prove that the suspicions aren't valid. Brussels has been cracking down on tech companies since the DSA took effect last year. It has also opened an investigation into another e-commerce platform, AliExpress, as well as social media sites such as X and Tiktok, which bowed to pressure after the commission demanded answers about a new rewards feature. Temu has also faced scrutiny in the United States, where a congressional report last year accused the company of failing to prevent goods made by forced labor from being sold on its platform.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-online-retailer-temu-faces-eu-probe-into-rogue-traders-illegal-goods/7846144.html	2024-10-31T06:44:33-07:00	
Pakistan says China's remarks on safety of its citizens 'perplexing'	Islamabad — Pakistan pushed back Thursday against China's criticism of the safety of Chinese personnel in the country, calling the comments 'perplexing' and contrary to established diplomatic traditions between the neighbors. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch said at a weekly news conference in Islamabad that the government is dedicated to ensuring the security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in Pakistan. Baloch was responding to a rare public warning from the Chinese ambassador to the country, Jiang Zaidong, who urged Islamabad to take action against militants responsible for several deadly attacks on Chinese workers. Jiang labeled the violence 'unacceptable' and cautioned that it poses 'a constraint' on Beijing’s investments under its Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. 'The statement of the Chinese ambassador is perplexing and is not reflective of the diplomatic traditions between Pakistan and China,' Baloch said. 'We will continue to engage with our Chinese brothers to reassure them of Pakistan’s complete commitment to their security and well-being in Pakistan,' she added. Jiang, while addressing a seminar in Islamabad, referenced suicide car bombings in March and October of this year, which resulted in the deaths of seven Chinese personnel. It raised the number of Chinese workers killed in Pakistan to 21 since the countries launched a massive infrastructure project as part of the BRI about a decade ago. 'It is unacceptable for us to be attacked twice in only six months,' the Chinese diplomat stated, speaking through his interpreter. He stressed the need for Islamabad to take 'effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such terror acts and ensure that perpetrators are identified, caught, and punished.' It is unprecedented for Pakistan to respond publicly to China’s criticism, and it is extremely rare for the Chinese ambassador to admonish Islamabad for alleged security lapses against Chinese engineers and workers. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, considered the flagship project of the BRI, has brought more than $25 billion in Chinese investment to enhance Pakistan’s infrastructure, facilitating improved bilateral trade and further integrating the broader South Asian region. Jiang urged Pakistan to take action against 'all anti-China terrorist groups,' stating that 'security is the biggest concern' for Beijing. He added that 'without a safe and sound environment, nothing can be achieved.' Baloch said investigations into attacks on Chinese workers are ongoing and said the findings have been communicated to Beijing. She did not elaborate. CPEC has resulted in roads, highways, primarily coal-fired power plants, and the strategic deepwater Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while addressing Tuesday’s seminar organized by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan-China Institute, assured the Chinese ambassador that his country was taking action against terrorists and tightening the security of Chinese nationals. Dar stated that Pakistan would share the progress with China in high-level talks next month. 'The Chinese are very clear; no matter how lucrative an investment is anywhere, if the security issue is there, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,' he told the audience, quoting Chinese leaders as telling Pakistani counterparts in recent meetings. Critics argue that Pakistan's financial difficulties and political instability have discouraged China from making new investments in the CPEC. After the launch of CPEC projects, Pakistan’s military formed a specially trained unit of over 13,000 troops to safeguard the initiatives nationwide. But the attacks on Chinese nationals have led to doubts about the effectiveness of the military unit. Most of the recent attacks on Chinese workers and engineers have been claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, a prominent separatist group waging insurgent attacks in Balochistan. The group, which is made up of militants from the Baloch ethnic minority, accuses China of helping Pakistan exploit the province’s natural resources and has been calling for Beijing to withdraw its CPEC and other investments. Both countries reject the allegations, saying Baloch insurgents are on a mission to subvert development in the impoverished province and undermine Pakistan’s close ties with China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-says-china-s-remarks-on-safety-of-its-citizens-perplexing/7846101.html	2024-10-31T06:34:45-07:00	
IMF: Mideast conflicts to leave 'lasting scars'	Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan will take decades to recover from the conflicts raging on their soil, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday after downgrading the region's growth forecast. Israel's military actions against Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Sudan's civil war would have enduring impacts, the IMF said. 'The damage caused by these conflicts will leave lasting scars at their epicenters for decades,' the global lender said in a statement. The IMF has lowered its predicted growth for the Middle East and North Africa to 2.1 percent for 2024, a drop of 0.6 percent due to the wars and lower oil production. Depending on the conflicts, growth should rise to 4.0 percent next year, according to the IMF's Regional Economic Outlook which was compiled in September. 'This year has been challenging with conflicts causing devastating human suffering and lasting economic damage,' Jihad Azour, the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department director, told reporters in Dubai. 'The recent escalation in Lebanon has greatly increased the uncertainty in the whole MENA region.' IMF forecasts for Lebanon, where conflict with Israel has sharply escalated this month, have been suspended. But 'conservative' estimates show a 9.0-10 percent contraction this year, Azour said. 'The impact (on Lebanon) will be severe and it will depend how long this conflict will last,' said the former Lebanese finance minister. Saudi-led oil cuts through the OPEC+ cartel, aimed at propping up prices, 'are contributing to sluggish near-term growth in many economies', the IMF said. For the region's oil exporters, 'medium-term growth is projected to moderate, as economic diversification reforms will take time to yield results', it added. Downside risks continue to dominate, the lender said, including fluctuating commodity prices, conflicts and climate shocks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imf-mideast-conflicts-to-leave-lasting-scars-/7846098.html	2024-10-31T05:57:00-07:00	
Papua New Guinea to boycott 'waste of time' UN climate summit	Papua New Guinea on Thursday declared a boycott of next month's UN climate summit, branding the global warming negotiations a 'waste of time' full of empty promises from big polluters. While plenty have criticized the annual COP summit in the past, it is rare for any government to so totally dismiss the UN's premier climate talks. 'There's no point going if we are falling asleep because of jet lag because we're not getting anything done,' Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko told AFP ahead of November's COP29 summit in Azerbaijan. 'All the big polluters of the world promise and commit millions to assist in climate relief and support. And I can tell you now it's all going to consultants.' The island of New Guinea is home to the third-largest expanse of rainforest on the planet, according to the World Wildlife Fund, and has long been celebrated as one of the 'lungs of the earth.' Impoverished, flanked by ocean, and already prone to natural disasters, Papua New Guinea is also considered to be highly vulnerable to the unfolding perils of climate change. 'COP is a total waste of time,' Tkatchenko said. 'We are sick of the rhetoric as well as the merry-go-round of getting absolutely nothing done over the last three years.' 'We are the third-biggest rainforest nation in the world. We are sucking up the pollutants of these major countries. And they are getting away with it scot-free.' 'Talk fest' The COP summit in 2015 hammered out the landmark Paris Agreement, under which almost every country in the world has agreed to slash emissions to limit soaring global temperatures. But subsequent gatherings have been dogged by growing criticism, stoked by a perception that big polluters are using their sway to limit further climate action. Meanwhile, adaptation funds set up through COP to help developing nations have been accused of sluggish bureaucracy that fails to grasp the urgency of the crisis. Civil society groups banded together last year to urge a boycott of the COP summit hosted by the United Arab Emirates, claiming the meeting would 'greenwash' the petrostate's poor climate credentials. Underwhelmed by proposed emissions cuts, dozens of African nations led a temporary walkout of developing nations during the 2009 COP talks in Copenhagen. And Ukraine has pressed its allies to avoid this year's summit if Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows face. But Papua New Guinea is among the first nations to have voiced such a full-throated call to boycott the COP summit altogether. 'Why are we spending all this money going to the other side of the world going to these talkfests,' said Tkatchenko. 'No traction' Papua New Guinea is one of five Pacific nations involved in a pivotal International Court of Justice case that will soon test whether polluters can be sued for neglecting their climate obligations. Low-lying Pacific nations such as Tuvalu could be almost entirely swallowed by rising oceans within the next 30 years. Tkatchenko said the decision to pull out of COP talks had been applauded by others within the Pacific bloc. 'I'm speaking up on behalf of the smaller island states that are worse off than Papua New Guinea. They were getting no traction and acknowledgement at all.' Papua New Guinea would instead seek to strike its own climate deals through bilateral channels, said Tkatchenko, flagging that negotiations were already under way with Singapore. 'With like-minded countries like Singapore, we can do 100 times more than COP. 'They have a big carbon footprint, and we would like to think about how they can work with Papua New Guinea to fix that up.' A key meeting ahead of COP29 ended in frustration earlier this month, with countries making little progress on how to fund a new finance deal for poorer nations. COP -- or conference of parties -- is the top United Nations climate change conference, an annual summit in which nations look to determine legally binding climate commitments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/papua-new-guinea-to-boycott-waste-of-time-un-climate-summit/7845979.html	2024-10-31T04:17:35-07:00	
Vatican tribunal explains conviction of cardinal and others in 'trial of the century'	The Vatican tribunal said Wednesday it convicted a cardinal of aggravated fraud and other charges because of his 'objectively inexplicable behavior' in paying a self-styled intelligence analyst over a half-million euros in Vatican money that she then spent on luxury items and vacations. The city-state’s tribunal issued 816 pages of written motivations from its Dec. 16 verdicts in the Vatican’s 'trial of the century.' The two-year trial of 10 people was borne out of the Holy See’s $380 million investment in a London property but grew to include a host of other financial dealings. Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a once-powerful cardinal who was the No. 3, or 'substitute,' in the Vatican’s secretariat of state, was the most prominent of the nine people convicted. He faces five and a half years in prison after being convicted of embezzlement, fraud and other charges. He and the eight other defendants have announced appeals, as has the Vatican prosecutor. With the tribunal’s written explanations now filed — nearly a year after the convictions were handed down — both sides can elaborate the basis of their appeals. The trial focused on the Vatican secretariat of state’s participation in a fund to develop a former Harrod’s warehouse into luxury apartments. Prosecutors alleged Vatican monsignors and brokers fleeced the Holy See of tens of millions of euros in fees and commissions and then extorted the Holy See for 15 million euros to cede control of the building. Becciu was convicted of embezzlement stemming from the original Vatican investment of 200 million euros into the fund that invested in the London property. The tribunal determined that canon law prohibited using church assets in such a speculative investment. Becciu was also convicted of aggravated fraud for his role in paying a self-proclaimed intelligence expert from his native Sardinia, Cecilia Marogna, 575,000 euros in Holy See money. He had said the payments were authorized by Pope Francis as ransom to free a Colombian nun held hostage by al-Qaida-linked militants in Mali. The investigation showed, however, that Becciu essentially double-billed the Vatican, with the same amount of money being sent to a British security firm that actually has expertise in liberating hostages. The nun was subsequently freed, but there is no indication Marogna had anything to do with it, the tribunal noted. The tribunal, headed by Judge Giuseppe Pignatone, said Becciu never provided a reasonable explanation for why he paid Marogna the same amount of money, or why he never asked her for any updates on her alleged efforts to liberate the nun. Even when told by Vatican gendarmes that Marogna had instead spent the Vatican’s money on luxury vacations and purchases at Prada, Becciu didn’t file a complaint with prosecutors or keep his distance from Marogna. Instead, they continued to communicate via a family friend. 'An objectively inexplicable behavior, all the more for someone in a position of the defendant, a cardinal prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and for seven years the substitute in the secretariat of state, who for a long period enjoyed the full trust of the pope,' the tribunal wrote. 'A behavior, moreover, that the defendant has never explained in any way.' Marogna, for her part, was tried in absentia and provided contradictory and inconclusive explanations in her written defense, the tribunal said. She too was convicted and sentenced to three years and nine months in prison. The bulk of the written motivations were devoted to deciphering the complicated transactions at the heart of the London deal. The text also repeated the tribunal’s previous rejection of defense arguments that the trial itself was fundamentally unfair.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-tribunal-explains-conviction-of-cardinal-and-others-in-trial-of-the-century-/7845950.html	2024-10-31T03:52:37-07:00	
China tells carmakers to pause investment in EU countries backing EV tariffs, sources say	China has told its automakers to halt big investment in European countries that support extra tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, two people briefed about the matter said, a move likely to further divide Europe. The new European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% came into effect on Wednesday after a year-long investigation that divided the bloc and prompted retaliation from Beijing. Ten EU members including France, Poland and Italy supported tariffs in a vote this month, in which five members including Germany opposed them and 12 abstained. Chinese automakers including BYD, SAIC, and Geely were told at a meeting held by the Ministry of Commerce on Oct. 10 that they should pause their heavy asset investment plans such as factories in countries that backed the proposal, said the people. They declined to be named, as the meeting was not public. Several foreign automakers also attended the meeting, where the participants were told to be prudent about their investments in countries that abstained from voting and were 'encouraged' to invest in those that voted against the tariffs, the people said. Geely declined to comment. SAIC, BYD and the commerce ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The move by Chinese authorities to suspend some investment in Europe would suggest the government is seeking leverage in talks with the EU over an alternative to tariffs, keen to avoid a sharp fall in EV exports to the key market. Europe accounted for more than 40% of EVs shipped from China in 2023, according to Reuters' calculations using data from the China Passenger Car Association. Given 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs in the United States and Canada, a drop in EV exports to Europe would risk deepening overcapacity Chinese automakers face in their home market. Investments in Europe During a visit to China by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez last month, a Chinese company agreed to build a $1 billion plant in Spain to make machinery used for hydrogen production. Spain was one of the 12 EU states that abstained. Italy and France are among EU countries that have been courting Chinese automakers for investments, but they have also warned of the risks that a flood of cheap Chinese EVs pose to European manufacturers. State-owned SAIC, China's second-largest auto exporter, is choosing a site for an EV factory in Europe and has been separately planning to open its second European parts center in France this year to meet growing demand for its MG-brand cars. An aide to France's junior trade minister Sophie Primas said they had no comment to make ahead of her trip to China next week. The Italian government is in talks with Chery, China's largest automaker by exports, and other Chinese automakers, including Dongfeng Motors, about potential investments. Italy's industry ministry declined to comment. Dongfeng didn't immediately respond, while Chery declined to comment. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, which voted against the tariffs. The Chinese EV giant has also been considering relocating its European headquarters from the Netherlands to Hungary due to cost concerns, two separate people with knowledge of the matter said. Even before Beijing issued its guidance, Chinese companies were cautious about independently setting up production sites in Europe, as it requires large sums of investment and a deep understanding of local laws and culture. The automakers were also told at the Oct. 10 meeting that they should avoid separate investment discussions with European governments and instead work together to hold collective talks, the people said. The directive follows a similar warning in July when the commerce ministry advised China's automakers not to invest in countries such as India and Turkey, and to be cautious with investments in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tells-carmakers-to-pause-investment-in-eu-countries-backing-ev-tariffs-sources-say/7845941.html	2024-10-31T03:39:30-07:00	
Low consumer spending in China hinders economy there and abroad	U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has joined several independent economists to express her frustration about low consumer spending and the property crisis in China. Some experts have expressed disappointment over Beijing's limited measures to stimulate consumer spending, which is one of the biggest hurdles in the Chinese economy. 'Our view has been that raising consumer spending in China as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) is really important, along with measures to address problems in the property sector,' Yellen said recently. 'So far, I would say, I haven't really heard any policies on the Chinese side that address that.' Yellen has criticized China for its focus on subsidizing large state-owned companies instead of working to revive the wider economy, the world's second largest. Analysts have suggested that China should stop subsidizing manufacturing companies with the money of households. The World Bank has predicted that China's GDP growth will be 4.8% this year, short of the country's 5% goal. It will slip further to 4.3% in 2025, the bank predicted. Low consumer demand in China can bring down the rate of growth in the global economy and affect the prospects of businesses in the U.S. and other parts of the world. 'For U.S. companies like Apple, Nike, Microsoft, KFC, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Tesla or General Motors, to name a few, China is a big market. Any increase or decrease in consumption in China can influence their bottom line,' Lourdes Casanova, director at Cornell University's Emerging Markets Institute, told VOA. There are serious fears about the U.S. and the European Union slipping into recession, said Francesco Sisci, an expert on China affairs and director of Appia Institute, an Italy-based think tank. 'In China, there's deflation and no sign of getting out of it. If China doesn't get out of deflation, it could multiply recessionary forces worldwide. It might actually happen,' Sisci said. Tendency to save, not spend China has taken several measures to revive the economy in recent weeks. They include lowering mortgage rates and cutting the reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to encourage banks to lend more money. The idea is to support households repaying home loans and encourage people to purchase more houses from the crisis-hit property business. However, analysts are not convinced about the effectiveness of the move. 'Housing demand is unlikely to see any meaningful revival just because of lower mortgage rates and down payment requirements, as experience shows,' the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) said in a commentary. Casanova thinks low consumer demand is not an easy problem to resolve because the average Chinese believes in savings more than spending. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) as a percentage of GDP stands at 68% in the United States, 53% in Europe and 39% in China. Americans represent 31% of global PCE, while China's people represent just 11%. 'There is room for improvement in China but, you can't change consumers' habits overnight and, clearly, Chinese consumers are much thriftier than the American ones,' she said. Americans often keep their cars outside the garage because garages are full of household items, clothes, toys, garage tools and other things, she pointed out. One way to increase consumer demand is to increase salaries and take additional social security measures. But for companies that would increase production costs and hurt exports, Sisci said. 'What China needs is transformative reforms that would have a political price, and the ruling Communist Party is not eager to pay it,' he said. Contradicting the World Bank's view, China's Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min said the economy was responding positively to a series of stimulus measures taken by the government. 'These initiatives aim to leverage government spending to stimulate overall social investment and consumption, thereby increasing effective market demand,' Liao said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/low-consumer-spending-in-china-hinders-economy-there-and-abroad/7845928.html	2024-10-31T03:22:43-07:00	
North Korea leader says ICBM test 'appropriate military action' against enemies	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA/TOKYO — North Korea said it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, upgrading what it called the 'world's most powerful strategic weapon,' as Seoul warned Pyongyang could get missile technology from Russia for helping with the war in Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the test was a warning to enemies that have been threatening the country's security, KCNA state news agency said. 'The test-fire is an appropriate military action that fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals, who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will,' Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA. The muscle-flexing comes amid international outcry and rising alarm over what the U.S. and others say is North Korea's deployment of 11,000 troops to Russia -- 3,000 of them close to the western frontlines with Ukraine. The launch drew swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States. A day earlier, Seoul cited military intelligence suggesting the North may test-launch an ICBM or conduct a seventh nuclear test around the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, seeking to draw attention to its growing military prowess. Shin Seung-ki, head of research on North Korea's military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the launch was likely to test improved booster performance of an existing ICBM -- possibly with Russia's help. 'North Korea will want to keep getting help like this, because it saves times and costs while improving performance and upgrading the stability of weapons system,' he said. It could also be Pyongyang's response to pressure over its engagement with Russia, Shin said. 'The intention may be to show that it will not bow to pressure, that it will respond to strength with strength, and also to seek some influence on the U.S. presidential election.' New records The launch early on Thursday was the longest ballistic missile test by the North with a flight-time of 87 minutes, according to South Korea. KCNA said the test set new records of its missile capabilities. The missile took off on a sharply lofted trajectory from an area near the North's capital and splashed down about 200 kilometers west of Japan's Okushiri island, off Hokkaido. It reached an altitude of 7,000 kilometers and flew a distance of 1,000 kilometers, the Japanese government said. The so-called lofted trajectory of a projectile flying at a sharply raised angle is intended to test its thrust and stability over much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific. North Korea's last ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-18, was tested in December 2023. Fueled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher, it was also launched at a sharply raised angle and flew for 73 minutes, translating to a potential range of 15,000 kilometers on a normal trajectory. That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range. South Korea announced on Thursday new export controls on materials needed by North Korea to produce solid-fuel missiles. Asked about the missile launch, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China 'has always believed that peace and stability, and promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue are in accordance with the common interests of all sides.' Pyongyang's latest test came just hours after U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun met in Washington to condemn the North Korean troop deployment in Russia. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have directly acknowledged the deployment, but Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia on Wednesday questioned why its allies like North Korea could not help Moscow in its war against Ukraine when Western countries claim the right to help Kyiv. South Korea said the deployment directly threatened its security because the North would gain valuable combat experience in a modern warfare and was likely to be rewarded by Moscow with 'technology transfers' in areas such as tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and military reconnaissance satellites.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-leader-says-icbm-test-appropriate-military-action-against-enemies/7845919.html	2024-10-31T03:06:40-07:00	
Trump, Harris discuss China through the lens of domestic concerns	Washington — With domestic hot-button issues dominating the final week of the U.S. presidential campaign, any mention of the U.S.-China competition by candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump has been through the lens of domestic concerns, analysts say. 'American voters are more concerned about domestic issues. Polls show that the so-called China threat ranks behind the economy, immigration, abortion, climate, democracy and other issues for voters,' said Liu Yawei, director of the Carter Center's China Program. According to a survey released by YouGov, a U.S. polling organization, only a minority of voters listed U.S. foreign policy as one of the top three issues for them. The survey found Trump’s supporters cared slightly more about foreign policy than Harris’ supporters. China and domestic policies Any mention of China has largely been in the context of domestic issues. In an October 27 rally in New York City, Trump mentioned China twice, saying that if the United States and China were to go to war, the U.S. would 'beat them,' and that he would 'pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, meaning if China or any other country charges us a 100 or 200% tax or tariff, we [the United States] will then charge them a 100 or 200% tax or tariff.' Harris made no mention of China during a rally on the same day in the key swing state of Pennsylvania. Trump has focused on the potential economic effects of competition with China as it relates to American jobs, highlighting trade concerns, flooding of goods, and unfair business practices. 'China has been killing us in trade for years. If I get elected, that’s going to stop,' said Trump at a rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa, in July. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump condemned China over several matters including an accusation that Beijing has taken away jobs in the American auto manufacturing industry and that China has posed threats Taiwan. At a rally in April, Trump said many migrants coming to the U.S. from China are men of 'military' or 'fighting' age who may be coming here to form a sort of 'army.' Trump has also mentioned China in the context of the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. 'They’re flooding our country with illegal drugs like fentanyl, killing Americans. This has to end, and it’s going to end when we bring tough measures back against China,' he said at a town hall event in New Hampshire in May. Although Harris has had less to say about China on the campaign trail, she mentioned China at the Democratic National Convention in August, saying she would work to ensure the United States wins the competition on being the global leader in artificial intelligence and space. She 'advocates 'de-risking' — reducing interdependence between the United States and China in arenas of advanced technology, principally to ensure that Washington is not assisting Beijing's military modernization — but she has warned against a tariff-centric economic policy toward China,' said Ali Wyne, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group, as he described her policies on China. But the two candidates and their respective political parties have more in common than differences in their rhetoric on China, said Dennis Wilder, the CIA’s former deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific and National Security Council's (NSC) director for China under President George W. Bush. 'China has not been debated in this election because the American public and political class almost universally share the same negative views of China. Polling shows favorable views of China in the U.S. in single digits.' While Washington’s policies toward Beijing can impact domestic issues such as jobs and cost of products, conflicts in other parts of the world have also overshadowed U.S. policy toward China in the eyes of many American voters, analysts said. 'Strategic competition between the United States and China is not top of mind for American voters. They are more concerned about the state of the economy and the cost of health care, said Wyne. 'And to the extent that foreign policy issues are shaping their considerations, they are understandably focused on a raging war between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for a regional war in the Middle East.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-harris-discuss-china-through-the-lens-of-domestic-concerns/7845906.html	2024-10-31T02:39:37-07:00	
European allies face challenging times, whoever wins US presidential election	BERLIN — The United States' European allies are bracing for an America that's less interested in them no matter who wins the presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald Trump returns to the White House. The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest contribution to Kyiv's defense. There are question marks over whether that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO allies in general. A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe that support would wane. Trump's appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic growth. But it's not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead. European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right now, but the long-term priority is China. 'The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it was in Biden’s formative years,' said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. 'And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic president.' The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. 'That means Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and also become more capable of managing its own security area.' Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more on the Indo-Pacific region, 'so it is only a question of, will they do much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less.' Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said that 'above all, Europe is looking for predictability from Washington,' and that's in short supply in a turbulent world in which any administration will face other demands on its attention. 'But the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a potential Trump administration.' 'There is an assumption of essential continuity' under Harris that's probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy under Biden likely to remain. 'It's very much the known world, even if the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own.' While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means 'the potential costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago,' Lesser said. Europe's ability to deal with that depends on how quickly it happens, he said. Europe's lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the 32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago. During his 2017-21 term, Trump threatened to abandon ' delinquent ' countries if they weren’t paying their 'bills.' In campaigning this time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them. His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war fatigue emerging in Europe itself. If Trump wins, 'there's every indication that he has no interest in continuing to support Ukraine in this war' and will push quickly for some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. 'And there is also just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were to withdraw support.' 'Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game,' Lesser said. Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and British leaders. 'We cannot let up. We must sustain our support,' Biden said. 'In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace.' The times he has lived through have taught him that 'we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances,' the 81-year-old Biden added. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany's highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations, hopes Biden's compatriots are listening. 'In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us,' he said. 'And I also hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just ‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends.' Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy. 'Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away angry,' Lesser said, noting there's 'every prospect' of divided government in Washington. 'Europe is going to face a very chaotic and sometimes dysfunctional America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-allies-face-challenging-times-whoever-wins-us-presidential-election/7845899.html	2024-10-31T02:12:42-07:00	
Palestinian health officials say Israeli raid kills 3 in West Bank	Palestinian health officials said an Israeli raid Thursday in the occupied West Bank killed at least three people. The operation included airstrikes in the area of the Nur Shams refugee camp. The Israeli military said it was targeting 'terrorist infrastructure' and that it killed a Hamas militant who was involved in planning attacks. Since Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 763 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli airstrikes Wednesday hit the historic eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, killing at least 19 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Hours before it struck, Israel's military issued evacuation orders for the entire city and parts of eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, where Baalbek is located. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fled in a chaotic scene of panic, one Lebanese civil defense official said. 'The whole city is in a panic trying to figure out where to go; there's a huge traffic jam,' Bilal Raad, regional head of the Lebanese civil defense, told Reuters. Baalbek is the site of a Roman temple complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Israel's warning said it was targeting Hezbollah. It has also issued evacuation orders before military strikes in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders, saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go. U.S. President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides met at the White House on Wednesday to discuss how to bring an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Cyprus, the European Union nation closest to Gaza, has played a key role in enabling the delivery of humanitarian aid into the territory. After his meeting with Biden, Christodoulides said he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanese cease-fire deal would be reached soon. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to be in Israel on Thursday. There, they will discuss a wide range of issues, including cease-fire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon and the release of the hostages that Hamas still holds. New Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said Wednesday that the militant group would continue fighting Israel in Lebanon and northern Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it considers acceptable. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a recorded televised address. 'We will not beg for a cease-fire as we will continue [fighting] ... no matter how long it takes,' he said. His remarks came a day after being named the militant group's new leader, replacing longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in late September. Kassem had served as Nasrallah's deputy for more than three decades. Kassem's speech came as international mediators launched a new push for negotiated cease-fires in Lebanon and in Gaza, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas militants for more than a year. Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the government's security Cabinet is discussing the terms of a truce with Hezbollah in south Lebanon, where Israeli troops are conducting a ground offensive. 'There are discussions. I think it will still take time,' Cohen told Israeli public radio. Israel's Channel 12 television said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with top officials Tuesday evening on Israel's demands in return for a 60-day truce with Hezbollah. Israel is demanding that Hezbollah pull back to north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the Israeli frontier. In addition, Israel wants the Lebanese army to deploy along the border, an international intervention mechanism to enforce the truce, and that Israel will remain free to respond militarily in case of threats. The war in Lebanon erupted late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas following its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The war has killed at least 1,754 people in Lebanon since September 23, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of health ministry figures, although the actual number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. Israel's military says 37 of its soldiers have died in its Lebanon campaign since it launched ground operations on Sept. 30. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. VOA U.N.

Spain searches for bodies after flood of the century kills at least 95	BARRIO DE LA TORRE, Spain — Survivors of the worst natural disaster to hit Spain this century awoke to scenes of devastation on Thursday after villages were wiped out by monstrous flash floods that claimed at least 95 lives. The death toll could rise as search efforts continue with an unknown number of people still missing. The aftermath looked eerily similar to the damage left by a strong hurricane or tsunami. Wrecked vehicles, tree branches, downed power lines and household items all mired in a layer of mud covered the streets of Utiel, just one of dozens of towns in the hard-hit region of Valencia, where 92 people died between late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Walls of rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that ripped into the ground floors of homes and swept away cars, people and anything else in its path. 'The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it's literally smashed up,' said Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre. Regional authorities said late Wednesday it appeared there was no one left stranded on rooftops or in cars in need of rescue after helicopters had saved some 70 people. But ground crews and citizens continued to inspect vehicles and homes that were damaged by the onslaught of water. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is heading to the region to witness the destruction firsthand as the nation starts a three-day period of official mourning. Thousands of people were left without water and electricity, and hundreds were stranded after their cars were wrecked or roads were blocked. The region remained partly isolated with several roads cut off and train lines interrupted, including the high-speed service to Madrid, which officials say won't be repaired for several days. While Valencia took the brunt of the storm, another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region. Southern Andalusia reported one death. The relative calm of the day after has also given time to reflect and question if authorities could have done more to save lives. The regional government is being criticized for not sending out flood warnings to people's mobile phones until 8 p.m. Tuesday, when the flooding had already started in some parts. Spain's Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding. But this was the most powerful flash flood event in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-searches-for-bodies-after-flood-of-the-century-kills-at-least-95/7845891.html	2024-10-31T01:56:15-07:00	
Uganda struggles to feed 1.7 million refugees as international support dwindles	RWAMWANJA, Uganda — For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat. 'As a woman who's not married, life is hard,' Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals 'keep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,' said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family. Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities. Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo. Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations. Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.'s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment. In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage. The international community 'should not take Uganda's generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,' Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. 'Services here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.' He also said international support 'is urgently needed to sustain Uganda's commitment to refugees,' urging donors and humanitarian partners to 'come together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.' Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported. Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi's visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was 'overloaded' with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding. 'We are trying to be innovative,' he said. 'Given the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.' Onek said the alternative is 'to survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.' But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get. 'For us to eat, we look for work, but there's no work,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-struggles-to-feed-1-7-million-refugees-as-international-support-dwindles/7845883.html	2024-10-31T01:43:39-07:00	
Use of firecrackers renews air pollution debate in India ahead of Diwali	NEW DELHI — As India gears up for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, people are divided over whether they should celebrate by setting off firecrackers, which worsen the country's chronic air pollution. Diwali, which will be celebrated Thursday, is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many Indians light earthen oil lamps or candles. But every year the festivities are tinged with worries over air pollution, as smoke-emitting firecrackers cause toxic smog that can take days to clear. The capital, New Delhi, which is among India's worst cities for air quality, is particularly impacted by the problem and is usually shrouded in toxic gray smog a day after Diwali. Authorities there and in some other states have banned the use and sale of firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for more sustainable options like environmentally friendly firecrackers and light shows, but the rule is often flouted. Firecrackers can be easily bought from roadside stalls and stores. Some residents in New Delhi say the ban doesn't make much difference, while others see it as a necessary measure to fight pollution. Vegetable vendor Renu, who only uses one name, loves celebrating Diwali in the city. Every year her kids set off firecrackers at night. She tells them to be careful but not to refrain from using them. 'Diwali is a day of celebration and happiness for us which comes only once a year, and I feel the ban should not be there,' she said. Others are against it. Unlike most kids, Ruhaani Mandal, 13, doesn't light firecrackers. She acknowledges it is fun but says it is hazardous for people and animals. 'I have seen firsthand the struggle of my father, who has lost his sense of smell due to pollution, and I see how his health worsens after Diwali celebrations,' she said. New Delhi and several northern Indian cities typically see extremely high levels of air pollution between October and January each year, disrupting businesses and shutting schools and offices. Authorities close construction sites, restrict diesel-run vehicles and deploy water sprinklers and anti-smog guns to control the haze and smog that envelopes the skyline. This year, thick, toxic smog has already started to engulf New Delhi. On Wednesday, authorities reported an AQI of over 300, which is categorized as 'very poor.' Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. A high level of tiny particulate matter can lodge deep into the lungs and cause major health problems, including chronic respiratory diseases. New Delhi's woes aren't only due to firecrackers. Vehicular emissions, farm fires in neighboring states and dust from construction are the primary causes of the capital's air pollution woes. But health experts say the smoke emitted from firecrackers can be more hazardous. 'The smoke that is produced by firecrackers contains heavy metals like sulphur, lead and toxic gases like carbon monoxide and fumes of heavy metals that are dangerous to our respiratory system,' said Arun Kumar Sharma, a community medicine professor at New Delhi's University College of Medical Sciences. Meanwhile, authorities in New Delhi have largely failed to enforce a strict ban on the use of firecrackers to avoid offending millions of Hindus across the country, for whom Diwali is one of the biggest festivals. To sidestep the ban, many sellers offer firecrackers online, some with the convenience of home delivery. Shopkeeper Gyaanchand Goyal said the ban on firecrackers has disadvantaged sellers like him and affected their biggest source of income during the festive season. 'The government enforces a restriction on firecrackers solely to demonstrate their commitment to the environment. Other than that, I don't think there are any other consequences of this ban,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/use-of-firecrackers-renews-air-pollution-debate-in-india-ahead-of-diwali/7845877.html	2024-10-31T01:21:49-07:00	
Taiwan shuts down as strong Typhoon Kong-rey hits, 1 dead	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — A strong Typhoon Kong-rey made landfall on Taiwan's east coast on Thursday, the largest storm by size to hit the island in nearly 30 years, closing financial markets, causing hundreds of flights to be canceled and reducing rail services. The typhoon knocked out power to nearly half a million households, the government said. The storm hit the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast county of Taitung, according to Taiwan's Central Weather Administration, with strong winds and torrential rain affecting almost all the island. The fire department reported one person had died when their truck hit a fallen tree in central Taiwan. At one point a super typhoon, Kong-rey slightly weakened overnight but remained powerful as the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane packing gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph), according to Tropical Storm Risk. Taiwan's weather administration put the typhoon's size at the biggest to hit the island since 1996. 'I hope that everyone in the country will co-operate in avoiding disaster and refraining from engaging in dangerous behavior such as wave watching during the typhoon,' President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page. Administration forecaster Gene Huang said after hitting the east coast it would head toward the Taiwan Strait as a much weakened storm and urged people across the island to stay at home due to the danger of high winds. Environmental officials were working on Thursday to prevent oil leaking from a Chinese cargo ship beached against rocks on Taiwan's northern coast after losing power in turbulent weather. Warnings for destructive winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph) were issued in Taitung, whose outlying Lanyu island recorded gusts above 260 kph (162 mph) before some of the wind-barometers there went offline. 'It was terrifying last night. Many people on the island didn't sleep, worrying about something happening to their house,' Sinan Rapongan, a government official on Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, told Reuters. Some roofs had been damaged and more than 1,300 homes had lost power but so far no injuries had been reported, she added. Parts of eastern Taiwan recorded one meter (3.3 feet) of rainfall since the typhoon began approaching on Wednesday. The defense ministry has put 36,000 troops on standby to help with rescue efforts, while almost 10,000 people have been evacuated from high risk areas ahead of time, the government said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest contract chipmaker and major supplier to companies like Apple and Nvidia, said it has activated routine typhoon alert preparation procedures at all its factories and construction sites. 'We do not expect significant impact to our operations,' it said in an emailed statement. Taiwan's transport ministry said 314 international flights had been canceled, along with all domestic flights. Taiwan's high speed railway, which connects major cities on its populated western plains, continued to operate with a much-reduced service. Kong-rey is forecast to graze China along the coast of Fujian province on Friday morning. China's financial hub Shanghai is bracing for potentially the worst rains in more than 40 years. Subtropical Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons. The last one, Typhoon Krathon, killed four people earlier this month as it passed through the south of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-shuts-down-as-strong-typhoon-kong-rey-hits-1-dead/7845876.html	2024-10-31T01:04:40-07:00	
Slovak PM Fico visits China in attempt for a pro-Beijing diplomatic turn	Vienna — Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico begins a six-day visit to China Thursday that includes a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and stops in the central city of Hefei and Shanghai to attend the opening ceremony for this year's China International Import Expo. Analysts say China is hoping to use the visit to strengthen ties with Slovak’s prime minister who is an ally of Viktor Orban and, like Hungary’s leader, has been critical of Russian sanctions and the EU’s support of Ukraine. Since coming to power, Fico has been interested in a more pro-China foreign policy. His trip to China, which was scheduled for June, was aborted due to an assassination attempt in May and has not been possible until now. Fico is the longest-serving prime minister since the founding of the Republic of Slovakia in 1993. Since first taking office in 2006, Fico has stepped down twice between 2010 and 2012 and between 2018 and 2023. In 2018, he resigned and gave way to his political ally, Peter Pellegrini, because of a political crisis sparked by the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. After Pellegrini's defeat in the 2020 parliamentary elections, the Ordinary People and the Independent Personalities Party formed a new coalition government. During this period, Slovakia pushed for a more pro-Taiwan and values-oriented diplomatic line, which drew resentment in Beijing. In the 2023 parliamentary elections, Fico won again and returned to power. The Fico government advocates an 'all-azimuth' foreign policy, including strengthening cooperation with Russia and China. In addition to this year's trip to China, Fico plans to visit Russia next year to attend the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. Matej Šimalčík, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA the so-called 'all-azimuth' foreign policy is a euphemism that means 'to engage in economic relations with any country, without taking any considerations for political values, human rights, or security considerations.' Šimalčík said, 'Fico’s government has also markedly toned down the scope of interactions with Taiwan, with some of his close political allies being outright proponents of PRC’s [China’s] interpretation of the 'One-China Principle,' which holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. Filip Šebok, head of the Prague office at the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, said, 'Fico has many times declared he does not want ‘Brussels’ to dictate Slovakia on these issues, and for him, it is a way to boost his credentials in leading a ‘sovereign’ Slovak foreign policy, despite criticism. 'Actually, domestically, it is good for Fico to claim he is doing something that is opposite to what is the Western mainstream, as he can maintain the support of his electorate. It is also a way to differentiate from the previous government, which was hawkish on Russia, and on China to some extent as well.' Analysts say that Fico's visit to China also serves an economic purpose. Pavel Havlíček, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs, said Fico is seeking partnerships and investments from countries outside of Europe. 'Among them, Russia and China are playing a special place, as was repeatedly mentioned when — for example — referring to the plan of the Slovak government to restore economic relations with Russia after the war. 'In the case of the PRC, the Slovak government is seeing investments and enhanced relations, too, to compensate for the lack of economic growth.' Šebok said the Slovak government has pledged to focus more on supporting economic engagement, such as boosting Slovak exporters or attracting investments in Slovakia. 'The government has, for example, increased the number of economic diplomats around the world and also opened new embassies in Asia or Africa explaining them mostly as a way to boost economic diplomacy,' Šebok said. 'In this perspective, China is presented as a major economic partner, and Fico will be leading a relatively large business delegation to China. Fico specifically wants to engage China in PPP [public private partnership] projects for the reconstruction/construction of transport infrastructure around the country.' Fico plans to work with China to promote large-scale infrastructure projects in Slovakia, including the reconstruction of roads and bridges, the expansion of the railway between the capital Bratislava and the city of Komárno, the completion of the Bratislava highway bypass and the construction of a hydroelectric power plant. In the recent vote on European tariffs on electric vehicles from China, the Fico government voted against it. 'Slovakia, through the Volkswagen plant, has exported a large number of cars to China,' Šebok said. 'It is particularly exposed to Chinese retaliation to EU tariffs on Chinese EV imports, as China directly hinted that it might target large engine vehicles from the EU, which are exported from Germany and Slovakia. 'What is paradoxical is that tariffs on Chinese EVs can actually be also indirectly good for Slovakia, as they can push more Chinese EV producers to set up manufacturing in Europe as a way to avoid tariffs,' he added.

Musk's X ineffective against surge of US election misinformation, report says	The crowd-sourced fact-checking feature of Elon Musk's X, Community Notes, is 'failing to counter false' claims about the U.S. election, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said in a report Wednesday. Out of the 283 misleading posts that CCDH has analyzed on the digital social media platform, 209 or 74% of the posts did not show accurate notes to all X users correcting false and misleading claims about the elections, the report said. 'The 209 misleading posts in our sample that did not display available Community Notes to all users have amassed 2.2 billion views,' CCDH said, urging the company to invest in safety and transparency. X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. X launched its 'Community Notes' feature last year, which allows users to comment on posts to flag false or misleading content, in effect crowd-sourcing fact checking to users rather than a dedicated team of fact checkers. The report comes after X lost a lawsuit brought by CCDH earlier this year that faulted it for allowing a rise in hate speech on the social media platform. Social media platforms, including X, have been under scrutiny for years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including false information about elections and vaccines. Secretaries of state from five U.S. states urged billionaire Musk in August to fix X's AI chatbot, saying it had spread misinformation related to the November 5 election. Musk, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in July, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. Polls show Trump is in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-s-x-ineffective-against-surge-of-us-election-misinformation-report-says/7845866.html	2024-10-31T00:37:33-07:00	
Botswana counts votes as ruling party seeks to extend its 6-decade rule	Gaborone, Botswana — The arid and sparsely populated African nation of Botswana counted votes Thursday from elections expected to return President Mokgweetsi Masisi to office after a first term marked by growing unemployment and concerns over the diamond-dependent economy. Voting on Wednesday was orderly in a country proud of its democratic system installed on independence from Britain in 1966, making it the oldest democracy in the region although it has always been governed by the same party. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is confident the results, which are expected late Thursday, will extend its 58 years in power, although commentators said weakened support may see the country's first hung parliament. Counting for the municipal ballot started immediately as polls closed late Wednesday while the parliamentary ballot boxes were transported to separate centers. With 61 parliamentary seats up for grabs, Botswana's first-past-the-post system means the first party to 31 seats will be declared the winner and install its candidate as president. Masisi, one of four presidential candidates, said after casting his ballot Wednesday he was confident that 'victory is certain.' But many voters said it was time for a change amid allegations of government corruption, nepotism and mismanagement. Most of Botswana's financial assets are held by a wealthy 10% of its people and the gap between rich and poor is one of the largest in the world, according to the World Bank. Unemployment rose to 27% as the economy suffered from a slump in the market for diamonds, its main source of income. 'The first priority for the next government or president would be to stabilize the economy, create a degree of strategic certainty in the mining sector,' political commentator Olopeng Rabasimane said. 'The second has to be employment generation, especially for young people. The third one would be diversification of the economy away from dependency on diamonds,' he said. Masisi acknowledged concerns about a decline in Botswana's foreign reserves and weakened international diamond sales, saying the government would increase local investments as a countermeasure. 'We intend to address that by putting money into the pockets of citizens and building infrastructure,' he told reporters. But the country needs more than construction, said Rabasimane. 'You cannot build roads only where there is no money to service those roads.' In 2023 growth fell to 2.7% from 5.5% in 2022, the IMF says. It is projected at 1% in 2024. Weakened opposition Masisi was elected in 2019 with around 52% of votes. The party is not expected to win many more this time and the opposition has been weakened by division. Ahead of the election, two key parties quit the left-leaning Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), whose leader Duma Boko, 54, is also in the running. The populist Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and social democratic Botswana Congress Party (BCP) are fielding their own candidates, Mephato Reatile, 57, and Dumelang Saleshando, 53, respectively. The independent Mmegi newspaper said this week that 'historical momentum and the limping opposition' suggested that a BDP victory appeared evident. The UDC has claimed several irregularities around voting day. 'Our fear is that we are going to have another rigged election just as in 2019,' the head of a UDC monitoring group, Mike Keakopa, said. The party would decide later whether to take these complaints to court or choose other action, he said. Its attempt to have the results of the 2019 election thrown out over alleged irregularities was dismissed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-counts-votes-as-ruling-party-seeks-to-extend-its-6-decade-rule/7845861.html	2024-10-31T00:26:27-07:00	
Iran wary over US presidential election	TEHRAN, Iran — America's presidential election next week comes just after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just as high as they did then. Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described 'Axis of Resistance' — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel's strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks. Iran's currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels. In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran's mandatory law on the headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country. That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which candidate would be better for their country — if at all. 'All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change,' said Sadegh Rabbani, 65. Harris and Trump have offer hard-line views on Iran Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on Iran. In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle East even before Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad. Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that she would always 'give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.' For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results, though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023. In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth, 22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win. 'We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy,' Rezaei told The Associated Press. 'It is time for a woman ... I think she (Harris) will better since she is not after war.' Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student, agreed. 'I think Harris knows the world better,' he said. 'She and (Joe) Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This mean moving toward peace.' Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a better fit. 'I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to get a quick deal with Iran,' said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a double-glazed window workshop. 'The Biden administration including Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when they were in power.' Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops from the Mideast during his term in office. Iran's government wants sanctions gone Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the camera. Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins. While saying he wants Trump to win 'for my own reasons,' 53-year-old Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war '100%' sure to happen. A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any deals with Iran because 'men can talk to men.' 'I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for us,' said Fariba Oodi. 'We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our kids are paying a price for that,' she added. 'But I still think if it’s Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student and plans to apply' to study in America. Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions. Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling in the November election, which Tehran denies. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Pezeshkian's administration, said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the 'national sovereignty of other countries.' It also wants Washington to 'avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years,' she said. Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday. 'The talks will be a war of attrition,' Ali Soufi told the pro-reform Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such talks 'are unlikely to be fruitful.' But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 'You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents' come and go, said Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher 'He knows how to deal with the next one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-wary-over-us-presidential-election/7845855.html	2024-10-30T23:58:19-07:00	
Ukraine says Russian attack killed 1, injured dozens in Kharkiv	The governor of northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region said Thursday one person was dead and 29 others injured after a Russian missile strike on a residential building. Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram the person killed in the late Wednesday attack was 11 years old. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian attack hit a nine-story building, and he reiterated his calls for more help in defending Ukraine. 'Partners see what happens every day,' Zelenskyy said. 'In these circumstances, every delayed decision on their part means dozens or even hundreds more Russian bombs used against Ukraine. Their decisions are the lives of our people. That is why we must stop Russia together — and do so with all possible force.' Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said Thursday that Ukrainian air defenses downed a wave of drones targeting the Ukrainian capital overnight. Popko reported on Telegram that falling debris from downed drones damaged two residential buildings and an administrative building. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down 21 Ukrainian drones. The intercepts took place over the Rostov, Kursk, Volgograd, Bryansk, Belgorod and Voronezh regions, and over the Black Sea, the ministry said. North Korean troops U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-hyun, urged North Korea on Wednesday to withdraw from Russia an estimated 10,000 troops, which both countries believe are headed to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine. 'They're doing this because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has lost a lot of troops, a lot of troops. And, you know, he has a choice of either getting other people to help him, or he can mobilize. And he doesn't want to mobilize, because then the people in Russia will begin to understand the extent of his losses, of their losses,' Austin said during a joint news conference at the Pentagon. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials say. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. 'Kim Jong Un didn't hesitate to sell out his young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,' Kim Yong-hyun said. 'I believe such activities are a war crime that is not only anti-humanitarian but also anti-peaceful.' Western nations have expressed concerns about what Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear ballistic missile programs. The South Korean defense minister said it was likely that North Korea would seek nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile technology in exchange for the troops, escalating security threats on the peninsula and across the globe. UN Security Council meeting At the United Nations, Ukraine — with the support of the United States, Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, Slovenia and Malta — requested the Security Council meet to discuss the development. Russia's envoy dismissed the meeting, saying it was convened to tarnish Moscow with more lies and disinformation, adding it was 'bare-faced lies' that North Korean soldiers are in Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's comments appeared to contradict Putin, who last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, saying it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Nebenzia went on to assert that the Western nations were making accusations about North Korean troops assisting Moscow to lure South Korea into providing Ukraine with arms. 'We can see the Western spectacle in the Security Council today pursuing another goal. The Zelenskyy regime and collaborators for two years have been trying to compel the Republic of Korea [South Korea] to more actively cooperate with the Kyiv regime, and to have them provide and supply the much-needed lethal weapons. And here, the anti-Pyongyang frenzied rhetoric is very convenient for Washington, London and Brussels, because their own supply is something that the Kyiv regime has drained,' Nebenzia said. 'We do hope that our South Korean colleagues will be wise enough not to fall for this trick.' Since the war started, Seoul has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and sent both humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv but has not sent weapons, in line with its policy of not arming countries actively engaged in conflicts. On Tuesday, Seoul said it could consider sending weapons to Ukraine in response to the North dispatching troops to Russia. Troop estimates Ukraine's ambassador said as many as 12,000 North Korean troops are being trained at five training grounds in Russia's eastern military district. 'This contingent includes at least 500 officers of the DPRK army, with at least three generals from the general staff,' Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's full name. 'Subsequently, it is planned to form at least five units or formations from DPRK military personnel, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 servicemen each.' The troops' identities are expected to be concealed, Kyslytsya said, and they will be provided with Russian military uniforms and weapons and identity papers. They are likely to be integrated into units with ethnic minorities from the Asian part of Russia, he said. 'According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia's border with Ukraine,' Kyslytsya said, adding that they are expected to begin directly participating in combat operations against Ukrainian troops in November. The Pentagon said Tuesday that a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia's Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. Kyslytsya told the Security Council that they number about 400. Pyongyang and Moscow are in close contact and are entitled to develop bilateral relations in many fields, said North Korea's envoy, citing their strategic partnership treaty. 'If Russia's sovereignty and security interests are exposed to and threatened by continued dangerous attempts of the United States and the West, and if it is judged that we should respond to them with something, we will make a necessary decision,' Ambassador Kim Song told the council. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-attack-killed-1-injured-dozens-in-kharkiv/7845848.html	2024-10-30T23:09:27-07:00	
Americans are anxious and frustrated about the presidential campaign, an AP-NORC poll finds	WASHINGTON — Most Americans are feeling a lot of emotions heading into Election Day, but excitement is not one of them. A new poll from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about the 2024 presidential campaign, and a similar share say they're interested. Only about one-third say they feel excited. There's a broad feeling of uncertainty hanging over the 2024 presidential contest during the last week of the campaign. The race is competitive nationally and in key swing states, according to recent polls, with neither Democrat Kamala Harris nor Republican Donald Trump showing a measurable advantage. At the same time, the candidates have offered closing arguments that are in stark contrast with each other, with Harris arguing that Trump is obsessed with revenge and his own personal needs, while Trump referred to Harris at a rally on Sunday night as 'a trainwreck who has destroyed everything in her path.' Some groups are even more anxious than they were four years ago, even though that election took place in the midst of a deadly pandemic. In 2020, an AP-NORC poll found that about two-thirds of Americans were anxious about the election, which is not statistically significant from the new result. But for partisans, anxiety is dialed a little higher. About 8 in 10 Democrats say anxious describes how they are feeling now, up slightly from around three-quarters in the last election. About two-thirds of Republicans are anxious, a moderate uptick from around 6 in 10 in 2020. Independents, by contrast, haven't shifted meaningfully, and they're also feeling less worried than Democrats or Republicans. About half say they are anxious, similar to the finding in 2020. Other emotions have gotten more intense compared to past election cycles, including excitement. About one-third of Americans report feeling excited about the 2024 campaign, up from around one-quarter in 2016. But a majority of Americans say they are not excited about this year's race. One thing has stayed fairly constant, though: Americans' level of frustration with the campaign. Roughly 7 in 10 Americans say frustrated describes their emotional state, similar to 2020. For those Americans, though, there is light on the horizon — soon, the election will be over. The poll of 1,233 adults was conducted Oct. 24-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.	https://www.voanews.com/a/americans-are-anxious-and-frustrated-about-the-presidential-campaign-an-ap-norc-poll-finds-/7845844.html	2024-10-30T22:31:54-07:00	
2 Mexican journalists shot dead in past 24 hours	MEXICO CITY — Two Mexican journalists were shot dead in less than 24 hours in western states, according to authorities, as the country faces a flare-up of violence in the region. A Mexican journalist was shot dead in the western state of Colima on Wednesday afternoon, the state persecutor's office told Reuters. Her name was Patricia Ramirez, also known by her nickname Paty Bunbury, and she worked as an entertainment reporter, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based rights group. It was the second journalist shot dead in less than 24 hours in Mexico, ranked as one of the deadliest countries for journalists by press freedom groups, after the head of an online news outlet in Mexico was killed late on Tuesday. The killings marked the first of a journalist under President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office at the beginning of this month and has pledged to combat violence and crime. Mauricio Cruz was shot dead Tuesday in the city of Uruapan, in the violence-plagued western state of Michoacan, according to the state prosecutor's office. Another person, who the prosecutor did not identify, was wounded in the shooting. Uruapan is known for brazen crimes such as beheadings stemming from fighting between drugs cartels or face-offs with law enforcement. Cruz's news outlet, MinutoXMinuto Michoacan, posted a tribute to the journalist on its Facebook page featuring his last live video recorded minutes before his death. While the nation has been rocked by a wave of violence, Sheinbaum has followed the work of her predecessor and mentor, former president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, stating that her government would not wage a new war on Mexico's drug cartels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-journalists-shot-dead-in-past-24-hours/7845835.html	2024-10-30T22:05:10-07:00	
Dozens of North Korean defectors caught by secret police 'vanish,' rights group says	seoul, south korea — More than 100 North Koreans have gone missing after being caught by secret police while trying to defect from the isolated country or even for trying to call relatives in South Korea, a Seoul-based human rights group said Thursday. The Transitional Justice Working Group (TJWG) released a report detailing patterns of enforced disappearances through its study based on interviews with 62 North Korean escapees in South Korea. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have defected in the decades since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, with many of those caught or repatriated sent to prison camps or other detention facilities before being released. The group identified 113 people in 66 disappearance cases, including the cases in an archive run with other international organizations, as well as maps depicting transfer routes. Of the 113, 80%, or 90, were arrested inside North Korea and the rest in China or Russia, with about 30% disappearing since leader Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011. Almost 40% of them went missing after being caught trying to flee the country, while 26% took responsibility for another family member's crime. Nearly 9% were accused of being in touch with those in South Korea or other countries. More than 81% vanished after being transferred to and detained by the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the North's secret police known as 'bowibu,' according to the report. An interviewee who defected to the South in 2018 from the Chinese border city of Hyesan said his friend was arrested by the MSS while trying to recover a Chinese mobile phone hidden in the mountains and was now rumored to have died. 'Once (the MSS) finds call records with South Korea, they are considered serious offenses,' the interviewee was quoted in the report as saying. Kang Jeong-hyun, director of the project, said the report was intended to underscore enforced disappearances committed by the Kim regime as transnational crimes also involving China and Russia. The report was published just days before the U.N. Human Rights Council is due to issue its Universal Periodic Review on North Korea. The United Nations estimates up to 200,000 people are held in a vast network of gulags run by the MSS, many of them for political reasons. A 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report said the prisoners faced torture, rape, forced labor, starvation and other inhumane treatment. Pyongyang has long denounced defectors as 'human scum,' and Kim has further tightened border controls over the past few years. The North's Korea Association for Human Rights Studies this month rejected a U.N. report on its human rights violations including forced disappearances, calling them 'fabrications' and a conspiracy by the West to escalate confrontation and tarnish the country’s image. Beijing has denied there are any North Korean defectors in China, instead describing them as illegal economic migrants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-north-korean-defectors-caught-by-secret-police-vanish-rights-group-says/7845827.html	2024-10-30T21:53:30-07:00	
Los Angeles Dodgers win World Series, defeating New York Yankees in five games	The Los Angeles Dodgers roared back from a 5-0 deficit late Wednesday to beat the New York Yankees 7-6 and win baseball’s 2024 World Series in five games. The championship is the eighth in the Dodgers’ 140-year history and was clinched in front of nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium in New York, most of whom hoped the Yankees could pull out a victory and take the series back to Los Angeles. The Yankees, trying to hold off elimination, jumped out to an early lead on the strength of home runs from sluggers Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton. But the Dodgers tied the game with five runs in the fifth inning, aided by an error in center field by Judge, who dropped what appeared to be an easy fly ball off the bat of the Dodgers’ Tommy Edman. After the Yankees scored in the next inning, Los Angeles went ahead for good with two runs in the top of the eighth, with the go-ahead run coming via a sacrifice fly from star outfielder Mookie Betts. Walker Buehler, normally a starting pitcher, entered the game in relief to shut down the Yankees in the bottom of the ninth inning and clinch the title. Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman was named the World Series’ Most Valuable Player after hitting four home runs and driving 12 runs during the five-game series. The Series drew high TV ratings not only in the United States but also in Japan because of the Dodgers’ Shohei Otani, who began his career in his native land and is a lock to be named National League Most Valuable Player after hitting a league-topping 54 home runs this season. The Dodgers won the first three games of the Series before the Yankees claimed game four. No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series. This was the Dodgers’ first championship since the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. Fans of the Yankees, baseball’s most successful and renowned franchise, were hoping for an end to a 15-year title drought. This was the first time the Yankees had reached the World Series since winning the championship in 2009.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-dodgers-win-world-series-defeating-new-york-yankees-in-five-games/7845833.html	2024-10-30T21:53:15-07:00	
Bolivia president calls for end of blockades, says costs exceed $1.7 billion	LA PAZ, Bolivia — Bolivian President Luis Arce on Wednesday called for the end of costly highway blockades that have paralyzed parts of the South American country and fueled an increasingly volatile conflict with his main political rival. The economic costs of the blockades over 17 days run into over $1.7 billion, Arce said in a message to the nation. Arce also said 70 people, including 61 police officers, have been injured in the blockades, organized by supporters of former President Evo Morales. 'We demand the immediate lifting of all blockade points for the re-establishment of normalcy in our country,' Arce said, adding that the government will implement the necessary measures to safeguard Bolivians if protesters do not follow that request. Arce's conference is his latest attempt to curb the growing tensions in the country, as Morales supporters have blocked key highways and prevented the delivery of food and fuel, particularly in the center of the country, the Cochabamba tropics. Coca growers, peasants and miners who make up many of the demonstrators have clashed with security forces trying to clear the obstacles from the roads. Morales criticized Arce, an ally turned rival, for not seeking dialog to solve the protests and holding him responsible for violence. 'Only sincere dialog will solve the serious problems that the country is currently facing,' Morales said on social media X after Arce's address, adding that the president had threatened the demonstrators. Morales told Reuters on Monday that Arce's government was behind an alleged gun attack on his convoy, lashing out at what he called a 'dark plot to destroy' him. Arce's government denied the accusations it had led an attack on Morales, calling it 'theater' and claiming the former leader's convoy had instead fired on special anti-narcotics police who were carrying out a patrol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bolivia-president-calls-for-end-of-blockades-says-costs-exceed-1-7-billion/7845812.html	2024-10-30T20:31:01-07:00

Dominant parties maintain hold in parliament election for Iraq’s Kurdish region	IRBIL, Iraq — Election results from the vote for the regional parliament in Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region show the two dominant Kurdish parties have maintained their hold while an opposition party has made inroads, officials said Wednesday. According to the Independent High Electoral Commission, the Kurdistan Democratic Party — with its base of support in the regional capital, Irbil, and in the city of Dohuk — made the strongest showing, securing 39 seats. The rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan won 23 seats, continuing its influence over the city of Sulaymaniyah. In the 2018 elections, the two parties won 45 and 21 seats, respectively. A relatively new opposition party, New Generation, won 15 seats, a significant increase from the eight seats it got in 2018, when the party was first established. The Kurdistan Islamic Union, which came in fourth with seven seats, announced it will join the New Generation in opposition in the regional, 100-seat parliament. Other minor parties took a smattering of seats. Despite some technical issues at the polls, voters turned out in large numbers, with 72% of eligible voters casting ballots. The surge in support for the New Generation appeared to stem from growing disillusionment among younger voters, who are increasingly frustrated with the region's ongoing economic challenges, including delays in salary payments, high unemployment, and perceived corruption within the traditional political leadership. Economic concerns remain at the forefront — widespread dissatisfaction over delayed payments to civil servants, fluctuating oil prices, and ongoing budget disputes with the central government in Baghdad have fueled calls for reform. Three Assyrian Christian candidates and two Turkmen candidates secured the five remaining quota seats for minorities, despite the Iraqi federal court's controversial elimination of the reserved seats for ethnic and religious minorities earlier this year. These seats are usually filled by candidates backed by the major political parties, leading some to say that they do not offer genuine minority representation. 'We no longer have true representation in the parliament or the government; our voices are being silenced,' said Toma Khoshaba, an Assyrian ethnic activist. Khoshaba argued that that these 'so-called independent Assyrian representatives occupying the quota seats are largely supported by the Kurdistan Democratic Party' or by Shiite factions. 'Their loyalty lies with these dominant political groups, not with our communities,' he said. The election outcome will also play a pivotal role in determining how Kurdish leaders handle ongoing disputes with Baghdad, particularly over oil revenue sharing and budget allocations, as well as the region's broader economic challenges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dominant-parties-maintain-hold-in-parliament-election-for-iraq-s-semi-autonomous-kurdish-region/7845793.html	2024-10-30T19:43:02-07:00	
North Korea long-range ballistic missile test splashes down between Japan and Russia	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired a long-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast on Thursday, South Korea and Japan said, a day after Seoul reported the North was making preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch, at a sharply raised angle, was from an area near the North's capital, Pyongyang, at 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT), the Joint Chiefs said in a statement. The Japanese government later said the missile dropped into the sea at 8:37 a.m. (2337 GMT). 'It is believed the North Korea ballistic missile is a long-range ballistic missile fired at a high angle,' the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Earlier, the Japanese government said the missile was expected to land about 300 kilometers west of its Okushiri Island off its northern Hokkaido region, outside its exclusive economic zone and toward the Russian coast. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later said there had been no reported damage from the launch. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Japan strongly condemns the North's action, which threatened not only Japan but also the international community. He said the flight time was likely the longest of North Korean missile launches and could be a new type of missile. On Wednesday, South Korea's Defense Intelligence Command said the North had placed a mobile launcher at a location making preparations to launch what could be an ICBM around the time of the U.S. presidential election, which takes place Tuesday. North Korea has conducted a series of ICBM test launches at a sharply steep trajectory to let the projectiles drop within much shorter distances relative to the designed range, partly for safety and to avoid the political fallout of sending a missile far into the Pacific. But a launch with a flatter, standard trajectory is considered essential for ICBM development to ensure the warhead is capable of making a reentry into the atmosphere while maintaining control to hit an intended target. The North last test launched an ICBM in December last year, a projectile fueled by solid-propellant and fired from a road launcher. That launch was also at a sharply raised angle and gave a flight time that could translate to a potential range of 15,000 kilometers on a normal trajectory. That is a distance that puts anywhere in the mainland United States within range. North Korea has come under international condemnation after South Korea and the United States said Pyongyang had dispatched 11,000 troops to Russia for deployment in the war in Ukraine, with 3,000 of them already moved close to the front lines. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-hyun condemned the deployment at a meeting in Washington on Wednesday. North Korea's move to make its troops co-belligerents fighting alongside the Russians has the potential to lengthen the already 2 ½-year Ukraine conflict and draw in others, Austin said. North Korea has already been supplying arms to Russia including missiles, artillery and anti-tank rockets in more than 13,000 containers since August last year, according to the South's intelligence agency. Ukraine authorities have also said some of missiles fired by Russia were from the North. At a summit in June in Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive partnership treaty that included a mutual defense pact. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang directly acknowledged the supply of weapons from North Korea or the deployment of North Korean troops to the Ukraine war. Putin has said how Russia implements its partnership with North Korea is its own business. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will hold strategic consultations in Moscow with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Russia said Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-long-range-ballistic-missile-test-splashes-down-between-japan-and-russia/7845788.html	2024-10-30T19:31:09-07:00	
Mexico Supreme Court judges resign after judicial reforms	mexico city — A majority of Mexico's Supreme Court judges have submitted their resignations and declined to stand for election under controversial judicial reforms, the top court said Wednesday. In a move that has sparked opposition street protests and diplomatic tensions, Mexico is set to become the world's only country to allow voters to choose all judges, at every level, starting next year. Eight of 11 Supreme Court justices — including court president Norma Pina — decided not to seek election in June 2025, a statement said, adding that most of the resignations would take effect next August. The announcement came as the Supreme Court prepares to consider a proposal to invalidate the election of judges and magistrates. President Claudia Sheinbaum, however, has said that the court lacks the authority to reverse a constitutional reform approved by Congress. 'Eight people intend to change a reform about the people of Mexico... Do they realize the magnitude?' she told a news conference Wednesday. A day earlier Sheinbaum suggested the judges' real motive was to protect their retirement benefits. 'If they resign now, they will leave with all their retirement benefits,' Sheinbaum said. 'If they do not resign now, they will no longer have their retirement benefits... which is a lot of money,' she added. Former president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who enacted the reforms in September before leaving office, argued the changes were needed to clean up a 'rotten' judiciary serving the interests of the political and economic elite. Critics fear that elected judges could be swayed by politics and vulnerable to pressure from powerful drug cartels that regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials. During his six years in office, Lopez Obrador often criticized the Supreme Court, which impeded some of his policies in areas such as energy and security. Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador who became Mexico's first woman president on October 1, strongly supported the judicial reforms. The changes sparked diplomatic friction with key economic partners the United States and Canada, upset financial markets and prompted a series of protests by judicial workers and other opponents. Washington warned the reforms threatened a relationship that relies on investor confidence in the Mexican legal framework.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-supreme-court-judges-resign-after-judicial-reforms/7845790.html	2024-10-30T19:29:14-07:00	
Bidens host Halloween celebration at White House; first lady dresses as panda	washington — President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who dressed as a giant panda, hosted trick-or-treaters on the White House South Lawn on Wednesday for the last time. The first lady had participated in the National Zoo's announcement earlier this year that pandas would be returning to Washington. They arrived in the nation's capital in mid-October and Jill Biden donned the panda suit Wednesday as a 'welcoming gesture,' the White House said. Jill Biden added an educational theme to the event and named it 'Hallo-Read' to help encourage reading. She has been a teacher for 40 years. Earlier Wednesday, she read a short story about spooky pumpkins to a group of costumed children gathered on the lawn. She and the president later ventured outside at sunset and spent about an hour handing out treats. Biden, in a suit and tie, dropped boxes of White House Hershey's Kisses chocolates in the kids' tote bags while the first lady handed out copies of '10 Spooky Pumpkins.' Up to 8,000 people, including students and children tied to the military, were expected to pass through the White House gates during the day. A large orange moon and a sign that said 'Hallow-Read at the White House' decorated the south face of the executive mansion. The decorations also included cardboard representations of Willow, the family cat who is rarely seen in public, and stacks of books. Giant pumpkin decorations flanked the door. Biden dropped his bid for reelection in July. He leaves office in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bidens-hosted-their-final-halloween-trick-or-treat-event-first-lady-came-as-a-giant-panda-/7845758.html	2024-10-30T18:43:56-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes target historic Lebanese city	Israeli airstrikes hit the historic eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek on Wednesday, killing at least 19 people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Hours before it struck, Israel’s military issued evacuation orders for the entire city and parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, where Baalbek is located. Tens of thousands of Lebanese fled in a chaotic scene of panic, one Lebanese civil defense official said. 'The whole city is in a panic trying to figure out where to go; there's a huge traffic jam,' Bilal Raad, regional head of the Lebanese civil defense, told Reuters. Baalbek is the site of a Roman temple complex listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Israel’s warning said it was targeting Hezbollah. It has issued evacuation orders before military strikes in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders, saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go. U.S. President Joe Biden and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides met at the White House on Wednesday to discuss how to bring an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza. Cyprus, the European Union nation closest to Gaza, has played a key role in enabling the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza After his meeting with Biden, Christodoulides said he was 'quite optimistic' that a Lebanese cease-fire deal would be reached soon. Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein are scheduled to be in Israel on Thursday. There, they will discuss a wide range of issues, including cease-fire agreements in Gaza and Lebanon and the release of the hostages that Hamas still holds. New Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said Wednesday that the militant group would continue fighting Israel in Lebanon and northern Israel until it is offered cease-fire terms it considers acceptable. 'If the Israelis decide to stop the aggression, we say that we accept, but according to the conditions that we see as suitable,' Kassem said, speaking from an undisclosed location in a recorded televised address. 'We will not beg for a cease-fire as we will continue (fighting) ... no matter how long it takes,' he said. His remarks came a day after being named the militant group’s new leader, replacing longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb in late September. Kassem had served as Nasrallah's deputy for more than three decades. Kassem’s speech came as international mediators launched a new push for negotiated cease-fires in Lebanon and Gaza, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas militants for more than a year. Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the government’s security Cabinet is discussing the terms of a truce with Hezbollah in south Lebanon, where Israeli troops are conducting a ground offensive. 'There are discussions, I think it will still take time,' Cohen told Israeli public radio. Israel's Channel 12 television said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with top officials Tuesday evening on Israel's demands in return for a 60-day truce with Hezbollah. Israel is demanding a Hezbollah pullback to north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers from the Israeli frontier. In addition, Israel wants the Lebanese army to deploy along the border, an international intervention mechanism to enforce the truce, and that Israel will remain free to respond militarily in case of threats. Cohen, a former intelligence minister, said, 'Thanks to all the army's operations these past months and particularly these past weeks ... Israel can come in a position of strength after the entire Hezbollah leadership was eliminated and over 2,000 Hezbollah terrorist infrastructures were hit.' Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Tuesday that Hezbollah's 'residual capabilities in terms of missiles and rockets' were estimated to be at 20% of what they had been. He said Hezbollah had been 'pushed back from all villages' on the border with Israel. Israeli media reported that U.S. President Joe Biden's Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, and special envoy Amos Hochstein, are headed to the Mideast Wednesday to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to discuss conditions for a cease-fire with Hezbollah. The war in Lebanon began late last month, nearly a year after Hezbollah began low-intensity cross-border fire into Israel in support of Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The war has killed at least 1,754 people in Lebanon since Sept. 23, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of health ministry figures, although the actual number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. Israel's military says it has lost 37 soldiers in its Lebanon campaign since it launched ground operations on September 30. Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings Wednesday for people in parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, warning of military actions against Hezbollah targets in the area. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said people in Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris should leave their homes. Israeli forces have frequently followed such warnings with airstrikes as they carry out a campaign Israeli officials say is meant to push Hezbollah back from the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has used the same methods in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go in the midst of the war. UNRWA ban U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has written to Netanyahu expressing his concern over new Israeli legislation that would ban the main U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees. 'Obviously, if it is implemented, it is clear that it will have a devastating impact on the humanitarian situation of Palestinians in the occupied territory,' U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. He said Guterres has also written to the president of the U.N. General Assembly, which created UNRWA, the Palestinian relief agency, in December 1949. Guterres called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, said 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas' and accused Guterres of ignoring that 'indisputable fact.' The new Israeli legislation bans the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and forbids Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Norway's prime minister said Tuesday his government will submit a resolution to the U.N. General Assembly for it to request a ruling from the International Court of Justice on whether Israel would be violating international law. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. VOA U.N.

Pentagon, South Korea urge North Korea to withdraw troops from Russia	Pentagon and United Nations — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-hyun, urged North Korea on Wednesday to withdraw from Russia an estimated 10,000 troops, which both countries believe are headed to fight alongside Russia in its war in Ukraine. 'They're doing this because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has lost a lot of troops, a lot of troops. And, you know, he has a choice of either getting other people to help him, or he can mobilize. And he doesn't want to mobilize, because then the people in Russia will begin to understand the extent of his losses, of their losses,' Austin said during a joint news conference at the Pentagon. More than a half-million Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022, U.S. officials say. Russia, they say, is now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces. 'Kim Jong Un didn't hesitate to sell out his young people and troops as cannon fodder mercenaries,' Kim said. 'I believe such activities are a war crime that is not only anti-humanitarian but also anti-peaceful.' Western nations have expressed concerns about what Kim Jong Un's regime will get in return from Moscow for its troops. North Korea is under international sanctions for its illicit nuclear ballistic missile programs. The South Korean defense minister said it was likely that North Korea would seek nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missile technology in exchange for the troops, escalating security threats on the peninsula and across the globe. UN Security Council meeting At the United Nations, Ukraine — with the support of the United States, Britain, France, Japan, South Korea, Slovenia and Malta — requested the Security Council meet to discuss the development. Russia's envoy dismissed the meeting, saying it was convened to tarnish Moscow with more lies and disinformation, adding it was 'bare-faced lies' that North Korean soldiers are in Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's comments appeared to contradict Putin, who last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, saying it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. Nebenzia went on to claim that the Western nations were making accusations about North Korean troops assisting Moscow to lure South Korea into providing Ukraine with arms. 'We can see the Western spectacle in the Security Council today pursuing another goal. The Zelenskyy regime and collaborators for two years have been trying to compel the Republic of Korea [South Korea] to more actively cooperate with the Kyiv regime, and to have them provide and supply the much-needed lethal weapons. And here, the anti-Pyongyang frenzied rhetoric is very convenient for Washington, London and Brussels, because their own supply is something that the Kyiv regime has drained,' Nebenzia said. 'We do hope that our South Korean colleagues will be wise enough not to fall for this trick.' Since the war started, Seoul has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and sent both humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv but has not sent weapons, in line with its policy of not arming countries actively engaged in conflicts. On Tuesday, Seoul said it could consider sending weapons to Ukraine in response to the North dispatching troops to Russia. Troop estimates Ukraine's ambassador said as many as 12,000 North Korean troops are being trained at five training grounds in Russia's eastern military district. 'This contingent includes at least 500 officers of the DPRK army, with at least three generals from the general staff,' Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's full name. 'Subsequently, it is planned to form at least five units or formations from DPRK military personnel, consisting of 2,000 to 3,000 servicemen each.' The troops' identities are expected to be concealed, Kyslytsya said, and they will be provided with Russian military uniforms and weapons and identity papers. They are likely to be integrated into units with ethnic minorities from the Asian part of Russia, he said. 'According to available information, between October 23 and 28, at least seven aircraft carrying military personnel of up to 2,100 soldiers flew from the Eastern Military District to Russia's border with Ukraine,' Kyslytsya said, adding that they are expected to begin directly participating in combat operations against Ukrainian troops in November. The Pentagon said Tuesday that a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia's Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. Kyslytsya told the Security Council that they number about 400. Pyongyang and Moscow are in close contact and are entitled to develop bilateral relations in many fields, said North Korea's envoy, citing their strategic partnership treaty. 'If Russia's sovereignty and security interests are exposed to and threatened by continued dangerous attempts of the United States and the West, and if it is judged that we should respond to them with something, we will make a necessary decision,' Ambassador Kim Song told the council.

Georgia investigates election rigging claims	State prosecutors in the country of Georgia said Wednesday that they had initiated an investigation into Saturday’s parliamentary election amid claims that the vote was rigged. The Georgian Dream ruling party won the election with 54% of the vote, according to the electoral commission, a figure that would give the party a clear majority in Parliament. The opposition alleged the election was rigged. Western countries and international observers also raised concerns, citing instances of voter intimidation, vote buying, double voting and violence. The opposition took its protest to the streets of Tbilisi early this week in a rally condemning the results. Prosecutors have summoned President Salome Zourabichvili, who is aligned with the pro-Western opposition, to testify, but she questioned why she should provide testimony about election rigging. 'It's not up to the president to provide proof of election fraud,' she told reporters Wednesday. 'Observers and everyday citizens have shown proofs of how massive the rigging of elections was.' The investigative body, she said, 'should have found the evidence itself.' Zourabichvili charged in an interview with Reuters on Monday that Georgian Dream used a Russian methodology to falsify some election results. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, a member of Georgian Dream, has called on Zourabichvili to turn over any evidence of rigging to authorities. He said he believed she did not have such evidence. Zourabichvili said the opposition was calling for an investigation 'conducted by an international mission with the adequate mandate and qualification' to look into how the election was conducted. Until that can be done, she said, 'this election cannot and will not have legitimacy or trust.' Some election observers have been cautious about labeling Georgia’s vote as rigged. Some observers, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, admitted there were reports of voter irregularities, but the organization stopped short of labeling the election as rigged. Russia has denied any interference in Georgia’s election. Georgia’s election came at a crucial moment for the former Soviet republic as it seeks to join the European Union. However, Georgian Dream is seen by many as more aligned with Russia than with the EU.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-investigates-election-rigging-claims-/7845431.html	2024-10-30T16:41:18-07:00	
Fears of major oil spills as Russia grows its aging 'shadow fleet'	There are growing fears that Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of aging oil tankers, which it uses to bypass the Western price cap, poses an environmental threat.

China-Russia cooperation blocks Antarctic conservation proposals	taipei, taiwan — China and Russia are deepening cooperation in Antarctica in a trend that analysts say could undermine marine conservation efforts and disrupt the long-standing status quo in the resource-rich region. China and Russia were accused of collaborating to block key proposals that would establish new marine protected areas and revise the krill fishery management plan in the Southern Ocean, during the annual conference of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Australia last week. The commission was established in 1982 and is a part of the Antarctic Treaty System, which establishes the legal status of Antarctica and comprises four different treaties. CCAMLR focuses on preserving marine life and other resources in the Antarctic. The commission has 26 members, including China, Russia, the United States, Australia and the European Union. Any member state can veto a proposed measure, and Russia and China have repeatedly used that power to block proposed conservation efforts by the council over the years. Some member states said every proposed measure at this year’s conference, including the establishment of four new marine protected areas and an extension of existing krill management measures, was blocked by China or Russia or both. 'Most concerning was the failure of some members to support the extension of existing krill management measures while the harmonization process is progressed,' a spokesperson of the Australian Antarctic Division told VOA in a written response. 'This is a backwards step for CCAMLR and puts krill, and the ecosystems and predators it supports, at risk,' the spokesperson added. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans that play a crucial role in the marine food chain. Limit on krill fishing The measure that CCAMLR member states hope to preserve is the mechanism that limits krill fishing in a protected area near the Antarctic Peninsula to no more than 620,000 tons. Another 620,000 tons of fishable krill are redistributed across several subareas to prevent overconcentration of krill fishing in one area. The measure needs to be renewed annually during the CCAMLR meeting with the approval of all the commission’s member states. Analysts said China's and Russia’s move to block the rollover of the krill measure will affect the sustainability of a crucial food source for species such as penguins, seals and whales. 'If there’s too much krill fishing in one small region of Antarctica, it will restrict the amount of food available to the seal and penguin populations,' Tony Press, an expert on Antarctic affairs at the University of Tasmania, told VOA in a video interview. In his view, other countries within CCAMLR should try to collectively challenge China's and Russia’s decisions to block the proposed conservation measures through diplomatic means or decide to implement the proposed measures without involving Beijing or Moscow. 'Other countries could decide that Russia and China’s behaviors mean they would have to start implementing decisions among themselves,' Press said. Experts say China and Russia refuse to support the proposed measures because they think setting up more marine protected areas will lead to more areas in the Antarctic becoming unavailable for use or development. 'They think once a marine protected area is adopted, it creates a snowball effect and generates more support behind the development of additional marine protected areas, which both countries think could lead to all marine living resource exploitation in the Southern Ocean being completely prohibited,' said Donald Rothwell, professor of international law at Australian National University. Lynda Goldsworthy, a research associate at the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, said one of China’s objectives in increasing its fishery footprint in the Southern Ocean is to 'increase geopolitical influence in the Antarctic region.' But since Russia is not as invested in the Southern Ocean as before, Goldsworthy said its decision to block marine conservation efforts in Antarctica is driven by an attempt to challenge the rules-based world order. 'Russia is playing the disruptor and [the objections] are part of their global disruption approach,' she told VOA by phone. The Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian Embassy in the U.S. have not responded to VOA’s request for comments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese Embassy in Australia also have not responded to requests for comments from VOA. CCAMLR successfully established two marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean in 2009 and 2017, but no new zones have been established since then. The four new zones proposed during the 2024 meeting would increase the protected area in the Southern Ocean to 26%. Antarctic status quo The deepened cooperation between China and Russia in Antarctica comes as Beijing expands its presence across the continent. In February, China inaugurated a new scientific research station near a U.S. research station. The development raises concerns among some security analysts that China may collect intelligence or develop its dual-used capabilities through the station. China’s increased presence in Antarctica has allowed Beijing to more boldly assert its agenda in some regional bodies such as CCAMLR, said Press. China’s behavior at last week’s conference 'is a reflection of their confidence because they are now a party with a significant presence in the Antarctic,' he told VOA. 'A lot of what they [China and Russia] are doing points to the idea that the actions they take now are to ensure there are no curbs on any future actions they might take,' Press added. Goldsworthy said the growing synergy between China and Russia in Antarctica could create potential challenges for the Antarctic Treaty System. 'There had been blockages for the protection of penguins on the Antarctic continent, and I do think both Russia and China are positioning themselves for [mineral mining] when or if the current mining ban is lifted,' she told VOA. While Beijing and Moscow have been consistently blocking CCAMLR’s proposals, Rothwell said it is unclear whether that trend has 'totally infected decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty,' which designates the continent as a demilitarized zone for peaceful purposes and scientific research. Even if China and Russia can’t easily challenge the treaty, Rothwell said that China 'will find it advantageous to align itself with Russia,' in order to fulfill its aspirations to exercise control and influence in Antarctica. Goldsworthy added that if China and Russia maintain their 'combative approach' in the Antarctic Treaty System, which includes CCAMLR, it could turn 'a safe and secure region' into a 'much less peace-oriented' continent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-cooperation-blocks-antarctic-conservation-proposals/7845395.html	2024-10-30T15:56:37-07:00	
Somalia's leaders agree on framework for universal suffrage	WASHINGTON — Political leaders in Somalia agreed Wednesday on a framework for the country’s first national one-person, one-vote elections, a government statement said. The decision followed marathon monthlong talks led by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud that saw the withdrawal of Jubaland President Ahmed Mohamed Islam, also known as Madobe, from the National Consultative Council meeting in Mogadishu. Somalia's government and federal member states said Wednesday that direct universal suffrage would be introduced with local elections set for June 2025. The agreement signed by Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre, the leaders of three regional states and Mogadishu’s governor laid out a path to nationwide one-person, one-vote elections. 'The leaders agreed to introduce national elections, where citizens will vote for their leaders, starting with the local, regional and municipal elections set for June 2025,' read a communique released at the end of the meeting in Mogadishu. 'The election of parliamentary and presidential leaders of the Federal Member states will be held on September 2025,' the statement said. The members of NCC also have ordered the completion of Somalia's National Independent Electoral Commission to facilitate the electoral process. Opposition stand In March, Somalia's parliament unanimously approved a bill overhauling the country's electoral system to reintroduce universal suffrage, a plan that has been criticized by some leading politicians. The leaders of two federal member states, the Puntland President Said Abdullahi Deni and Jubaland President Islam, opposed Wednesday’s decision. Unlike Islam, who stepped out of the NCC meetings two weeks ago, Deni repeatedly said that Puntland no longer would recognize federal institutions, accusing President Mohamud of violating the constitution and losing his legitimacy. Additionally, prominent Somali opposition leaders, including former President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, former Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire, and MP Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, have vehemently condemned Wednesday’s decision, calling it illegal. 'The decision illegally extends the terms of the regional presidents, threatens the national stability, the efforts of building good governance,' according to a statement from the opposition. 'We will never accept it.' The country has not had nationwide one-person, one-vote elections since 1969, when dictator Siad Barre seized power. Mohamud was elected by lawmakers in May 2022 and previously said the next national elections would be by universal suffrage. Currently, voting follows a complex, indirect model where state legislatures and clan delegates pick lawmakers for the national parliament, who in turn choose the president. UN Security Council Wednesday’s agreement comes on the heels of another significant development for Somalia. The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Wednesday facilitating the transition of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Somalia, or UNSOM, to the U.N. Country Team, or UNCT. This shift, prompted by a formal request from the Somali government, presented by the United Kingdom, received unanimous support from all 15 member states of the council. It establishes that during this transition phase, the U.N.'s support activities in Somalia will be rebranded as the U.N. Transitional Mission in Somalia, or UNTMIS. According to the resolution, the transfer of responsibilities from UNSOM to UNTMIS, alongside national authorities, will commence on November 1, and is anticipated to conclude by October 31, 2026. U.K. Ambassador to the U.N. Barbara Woodward characterized the passage of the resolution as the 'beginning of a crucial period for Somalia.' 'UNSOM has played an important role since its inception in 2013, supporting peace building and state building in Somalia through implementing its good offices, policy guidance, coordination, technical assistance and capacity building functions,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-s-leaders-agree-on-framework-for-universal-suffrage/7845398.html	2024-10-30T15:32:31-07:00	
Militant attacks in Pakistan hinder polio immunization campaigns	washington — Militant groups have intensified attacks against polio vaccination teams and their police escorts in Pakistan amid a dramatic resurgence of polio cases in the country. Officials say because of the deteriorating security situation, polio vaccination teams cannot reach communities in high-risk areas where polio is endemic. On Tuesday, militants attacked two health centers in the tribal districts of Orakzai and Waziristan that are being used in the polio vaccination campaign. Two police officials were killed in the attack in the restive region along the Afghan border. According to local officials in North Waziristan, militants took guns from the police officers guarding the polio team and warned the health workers not to take part in the anti-polio campaign. Pakistan Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in reaction to the latest violence, said in a statement, 'The terrorists' attack on the polio team is an attack on the safe future of Pakistan.' Violence has heightened safety concerns among front-line polio workers in the country. 'When I go out as part of [a] polio vaccination team, I am not sure I will return home safely,' Fahima Bibi, a front-line polio worker supervising vaccinations in northwestern Pakistan, told VOA. But Bibi said she is determined to do the job. 'The cause is bigger and needs bigger commitment and sacrifice,' she told VOA. Bibi's concerns for safety are shared by many of her co-workers. According to the Pakistan National Emergency Operations Center for Polio Eradication, 225,440 female vaccinators are working in the immunization workforce, going door to door to administer polio drops to children. They travel to hard-to-reach and remote, conservative regions in Pakistan, breaking cultural barriers. Ihtesham Ali, minister of health in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, expressed concern Wednesday over the surge in attacks. He told VOA that the 'security situation in the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is quite bad. And it is affecting access to communities. It is creating difficulties in our access for polio vaccinations.' 'A fearful environment' Most of the recent cases in Pakistan were reported in southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. World Health Organization officials in southern Balochistan province say militant violence has affected polio campaigns in the province. 'Polio teams go house to house in a fearful environment,' said Dr. Nayyar Khan Loni, a WHO official in Balochistan. He said that the recent attacks in Balochistan have forced polio teams to rush the vaccination of children in some areas. He said immunization campaigns have been modified because of security concerns. He attributed the recent polio outbreak in Balochistan to several factors, including cross-border mobility with Afghanistan and misinformation among certain parents about polio vaccines. Campaign against polio vaccinators Pakistan's hard-line extremist group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has sustained a violent campaign against polio vaccinators and security forces guarding polio team workers in Pakistan for nearly 15 years. Militants spread false claims that polio vaccines are part of a Western agenda to sterilize Muslim children. Also, militants target polio teams suspected of being government spies. In January, at least five policemen were killed and more than a dozen injured in a major attack on polio teams and security personnel in northwestern Pakistan. According to the Emergency Operations Center in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, militants have carried out 23 attacks against polio teams and security escorts in Pakistan this year. Overall, militant-sponsored violence has increased in Pakistan since the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021. According to independent think tanks tracking violence in Pakistan, militant violence has killed more than 1,000 Pakistanis, half of them security forces, in the first 10 months of this year. The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition identified 16 incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care in Pakistan in 2022, an increase from seven in 2021. Nearly 90% of these incidents involved threats and violence against polio vaccination workers, undermining health care providers' ability to meet vaccination targets. Experts say the TTP has ignored local and international religious scholars' fatwa (edicts) that support polio vaccination in Pakistan. Fakhar Hayat Kakakhel, a Pakistan-based researcher on militancy, said that because of military operations, militants lost space and polio vaccination teams gained more access to conflict areas. 'After August 2021, when the Pakistani Taliban regrouped in the region and got space, they restarted their anti-polio vaccination campaigns. And now we are seeing a sudden surge in cases of polio,' he said. Sindh province health officials say the security situation in Sindh is not like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but police are providing security to polio teams in Karachi and other parts of the province. 'Police are patrolling the streets in Karachi so that polio teams feel safe. We do not have any security issue, but [the] police department is with us,' Shumaila Rasool, spokesperson for Emergency Operations Center in Sindh, told VOA. Afghanistan and Pakistan launched synchronized polio immunization campaigns on Monday. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.

China warns security threats to its nationals impede BRI investments in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — China has increased diplomatic pressure on close ally Pakistan to take action against the militants responsible for repeated attacks on Chinese workers, warning that the violence is 'unacceptable' and poses 'a constraint' on Beijing’s investments under its Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. The rare public warning accusing Islamabad of consistent security lapses concerning Chinese workers was issued by Beijing’s ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, while addressing a seminar in Islamabad this week. Analysts said the remarks reflect China's increasing frustration with the security risks facing its workers in the South Asian nation. Jiang referenced suicide car bombings in March and October of this year, which resulted in the deaths of seven Chinese personnel. It raised the number of Chinese workers killed in Pakistan to 21 since the countries launched a massive bilateral connectivity project as part of the BRI about a decade ago. 'It is unacceptable for us to be attacked twice in only six months,' the Chinese diplomat stated, speaking through his interpreter. He stressed the need for Islamabad to take 'effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such terror acts and ensure that perpetrators are identified, caught, and punished.' The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, considered the flagship project of the BRI, has brought more than $25 billion in Chinese investment to enhance Pakistan’s infrastructure, facilitating improved bilateral trade and further integrating of the broader South Asian region. Jiang urged Pakistan to take action against 'all anti-China terrorist groups,' stating that 'security is the biggest concern' for Beijing and 'a constraint on CPEC' projects. He added that 'without a safe and sound environment, nothing can be achieved.' The CPEC has built roads, highways, primarily coal-fired power plants, and the strategic deepwater Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea in the country’s southwestern Balochistan province. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while addressing Tuesday’s seminar organized by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan-China Institute, assured the Chinese ambassador that his country was taking action against terrorists and tightening the security of Chinese nationals. Dar stated that Pakistan would share the progress with China in high-level talks next month. 'The Chinese are very clear; no matter how lucrative an investment is anywhere, if the security issue is there, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,' he told the audience, quoting Chinese leaders as telling Pakistani counterparts in recent meetings. Critics argue that Pakistan's financial difficulties and political instability have discouraged China from making new investments in the CPEC. Michael Kugelman, an expert on South Asian affairs based in Washington, told VOA that Beijing's security concerns have made it challenging for the mega project to regain momentum anytime soon. 'When the Chinese envoy publicly upbraids Pakistan for not providing proper security, you know there is a big problem,' said Kugelman, who directs the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. 'I imagine the objective moving forward will be carefully working to maintain and advance existing projects but being cautious about agreeing to new ones until China feels less concerned about security risks,' he added. After the launch of CPEC projects, Pakistan’s military formed a specially trained unit of over 13,000 troops to safeguard these initiatives nationwide. But the attacks on Chinese nationals have led to concerns regarding the effectiveness of this military unit. Hasnain Javed, a Beijing-based Pakistani foreign research associate, noted that China had never before publicly criticized Islamabad. 'This is a strong rebuttal and a serious dissatisfaction over the poor security around CPEC,' Javed told VOA in written comments. 'Now, when the military is the main guarantor, particularly for security, the Chinese seem to be running on low patience.' Most of the recent attacks on Chinese workers and engineers have been claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, a prominent separatist group waging insurgent attacks in Balochistan. The group, which is made up of militants from the Baloch ethnic minority, accuses China of helping Pakistan to exploit the province’s natural resources and has been calling for Beijing to withdraw its CPEC and other investments. Both countries reject the allegations, saying Baloch insurgents are on a mission to subvert development in the impoverished province and undermine Pakistan’s close ties with China. The BLA, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has lately intensified guerrilla attacks in Balochistan, killing hundreds of Pakistanis, primarily security force members, in recent months. During his visit to Pakistan earlier in October, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also highlighted the significance of security for economic development and cooperation. A post-visit joint statement quoted the Chinese side as stressing 'the need and urgency to take targeted security measures in Pakistan to jointly create a safe environment for cooperation between the two countries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-warns-security-threats-to-its-nationals-impede-bri-investments-in-pakistan-/7845351.html	2024-10-30T14:31:16-07:00	
Cartoonist sentencing shows Saudis' 'determination to silence any voice,' analysts say	The decision by Saudi authorities to sentence a cartoonist to an extra 23 years in prison marks an escalation in the kingdom’s suppression of dissent, analysts say. Mohammed al-Ghamdi, a cartoonist for Qatar-based Lusail newspaper, was already serving six years on a range of charges. But a court in October reopened the case and sentenced him to an additional 23 years without the possibility of appeal. Known as al-Hazza, al-Ghamdi gained prominence for cartoons that critiqued Saudi policies and highlighted sociopolitical issues in the Gulf. But his work, considered by some as sympathetic to Qatar during a politically tense period, was labeled as anti-state by Saudi authorities. Al-Ghamdi was arrested in 2018 on charges including alleged sympathy for Qatar and for producing what Saudi authorities said were 100 insulting drawings. At the time, he was sentenced to six years in prison and a travel ban. His case, along with that of blogger and podcast host Hatem al-Najjar, who was detained in January, suggest a broader strategy of repression that contradicts Saudi Arabia’s outward image of reform and modernization, analysts say. 'The Saudi authorities’ conflation of journalistic activities with threats to national security reveals their determination to silence any voice that deviates from the state narrative,' said Yeganeh Rezaian, a researcher at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. 'The severity of al-Ghamdi’s punishment underscores how this crackdown has expanded to include nontraditional journalists such as cartoonists, who globally often critique political power,' she told VOA. Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman assumed greater powers in 2017, Saudi Arabia has seen an intensified crackdown on dissent. One of the most widely publicized cases is that of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who in 2018 was killed and dismembered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in an operation that U.S. intelligence concluded had been approved by the crown prince. The country is the ninth worst jailer of journalists, according to CPJ data, and ranks 166 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment. Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, says independent media are 'non-existent … and Saudi journalists live under heavy surveillance, even when abroad.' The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s requests for comment sent via email and the embassy’s website. Abdullah Alaoudh, senior director for countering authoritarianism at the U.S.-based nonprofit Middle East Democracy Center, told VOA that under the crown prince’s leadership, targeting and detaining journalists, activists and even royal family members has become routine. 'Many journalists and activists have been targeted and detained. This has been continuous because there were no real consequences for such actions,' Alaoudh said. 'We have documented and proved that many activists have been electrocuted, sexually harassed and tortured in jail. There are even businessmen and princes tortured. People have died under torture, and others have succumbed to medical negligence,' Alaoudh said. He believes the cases are intentionally publicized to create a chilling effect. Reports from rights organizations indicate that al-Ghamdi has been mistreated in custody, including allegations of torture and forced confessions. Alaoudh said international influence could help bring change. But 'unfortunately, international leverage is being channeled into deals and transactions with the Saudi government, not human rights protections,' Alaoudh said. Reports of torture and forced confessions are prevalent in cases involving detained journalists in Saudi Arabia. 'Authorities frequently employ these tactics to extract confessions and validate harsh sentences against individuals who have merely exercised their right to press freedom,' Rezaian said. Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told VOA that the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has also flagged a troubling pattern of arrests in Saudi Arabia. 'The documented pattern of suppression has already broadly extended from activists and political opponents to ordinary citizens,' Dijkstal said. She cited the case of a person sentenced to death in 2023 for tweeting about government policy to just a small number of followers. 'The U.N. and international community must insist that Saudi Arabia comply with the remedies accompanying the U.N. findings, and that it genuinely respect and protect these most basic rights,' Dijkstal said. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United States and several European Union countries. Recently, Salman attended the EU-Gulf Summit in Brussels. 'It is disheartening that the U.S. and the EU, who purport to champion press freedom globally, are not prioritizing the press freedom situation in the kingdom in their dealings with MBS,' said Rezaian, referring to the crown prince by his initials. 'They have failed to publicly criticize the sentencing of a cartoonist without legitimate justification.' Rezaian believes the silence emboldens the Saudi government and exposes a troubling double standard in international diplomacy. 'This hypocritical stance on Saudi Arabia's abysmal record on press freedom only emboldens MBS to further tighten his control over media expression in the kingdom,' she said. In December, Saudi Arabia will host the Internet Governance Forum, an international event that focuses on human rights and inclusion in the digital age. 'It is deeply concerning to see Saudi Arabia hosting such a forum while simultaneously incarcerating journalists who express their ideas online,' Rezaian said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cartoonist-sentencing-shows-saudis-determination-to-silence-any-voice-analysts-say-/7845329.html	2024-10-30T14:13:37-07:00	
US detects H5N1 bird flu in pig for first time	CHICAGO, ILLINOIS — H5N1 bird flu had been confirmed in a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday. Pigs represent a particular concern for the spread of bird flu because they can become co-infected with bird and human viruses, which could swap genes to form a new, more dangerous virus that can more easily infect humans. The USDA said there is no risk to the nation's pork supply from the Oregon case and that the risk to the public from bird flu remains low. Pigs were the source of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009-2010, and have been implicated as the source of others, said Richard Webby, a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and birds for the World Health Organization. The finding of the virus in a small farm makes the pig infection less of a concern than if it had been detected in a commercial pig farm, he said. 'I think it probably doesn't increase the risk much, but surely, if this virus starts transmitting in pigs, that absolutely increases the risk,' he said. The Oregon farm has been quarantined, and other animals there, including sheep and goats, are under surveillance, the USDA said. Pigs and poultry on the farm were culled to prevent the spread of the virus and enable additional testing of the swine, the USDA said. Tests are still pending for two of the pigs, the agency said. The swine case originated with wild birds and not from a poultry or dairy farm, a USDA spokesperson said. Wild bird migration has carried bird flu to poultry flocks and cattle herds. The case was one factor that prompted the USDA to broaden its bird flu surveillance to include nationwide bulk milk testing, which the agency announced on Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters in an interview. 'While it’s a different variation of the virus and it is tied to wild birds, it is a factor to make sure that we understand and appreciate exactly where the virus is in dairy and in bovine,' he said. The pigs on the Oregon farm were not intended for the commercial food supply, the USDA said. The agency said that poultry and swine on the backyard farm shared water sources, housing and equipment, which have all served as pathways for transmitting the virus between animals in other states. The detection is a warning for pig farmers to be on the lookout for further infections, said Marie Culhane, a professor of veterinary population medicine at the University of Minnesota who has researched flu viruses in swine. 'People need to start increasing their plans to deal with it if it should happen in another herd and another herd,' Culhane said. 'Pigs are just really good at picking up influenza viruses.' This year, 36 people have tested positive for bird flu as the virus has spread to nearly 400 dairy herds. All but one of the people were farm workers who had known contact with infected animals. Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-detects-h5n1-bird-flu-in-pig-for-first-time/7845250.html	2024-10-30T12:44:39-07:00	
Chinese steel plant: Zimbabwe's economic boon or environmental nightmare?	harare, zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is aiming to be home to Africa’s largest steel plant, but disputes over the project continue even as it ramps up production. Over the past few months, villagers have been accusing the Chinese steel plant’s subsidiary Dinson Iron and Steel Company, or DISCO, of taking over their land without compensation, damaging the environment and not helping them relocate. There are also concerns that the project, along with the impact of the climate crisis, is impacting food security for villagers who live in areas near the plant. Chokutaura Chananda, 81, head of Mushenjere, a village in central Zimbabwe, told VOA that villagers are asking all stakeholders for help. They are also urging the Chinese steel company to honor its promises of compensation and relocation. 'We are appealing to all parties involved to intervene, to come together and support our cause,' Chananda said. 'As the rightful owners of the land, we deserve to be treated fairly by DISCO. We seek development, not destruction.' DISCO, which is a subsidiary of Tsingshan Holding Group of China, touted as one of the world’s largest producers of stainless steel, denies any wrongdoing. In June, some local villagers staged a protest and attempted to block DISCO’s trucks from entering the plant. The villagers accused the company of forcing residents off their farmland with no compensation, resulting in food shortages and severe dust pollution. Chananda told VOA that while the company welcomes investments and business development, residents felt the company’s behavior had been disrespectful and insensitive. The giant steel and mining company is erecting a wall around farmland and pastures in the area, further isolating families in Mushenjere Village from the traditional sources of livelihood. Before 2021, when the steel mine came to Manhize, residents in the area relied primarily on subsistence farming for their livelihood. Villagers said the plant has displaced more than 100 families, leaving them impoverished and food insecure according to villagers. A September report released by Centre for Natural Resource Governance concluded that Chinese mining operations in Zimbabwe are not necessarily mutually beneficial. 'Evidence on the ground shows a widening rift between Chinese nationals and their Zimbabwean employees and host communities. Increasingly, ordinary Zimbabweans are accusing China of exhibiting colonial traits,' the report said. The villages near the DISCO 'plant have been conspicuously excluded from engagement platforms' by the Chinese company, the report found. The report adds that 'this lack of meaningful engagement and consultation has led to feelings of disenfranchisement and marginalization among the affected communities.' Promises of economic benefits The $1.5 billion plant started production in July and is expected to create 10,000 new jobs when it reaches the final phase of production. It is currently operating at 60% of its capacity and aims to be at 75% sometime early next year. Anticipated to be an economic boon to Zimbabwe, the country hopes to reap financial benefits from the project when steel can be exported from the plant in the future. The steel industry could contribute approximately $5 billion to the national economy, said Winston Chitando, Zimbabwe’s Minister of Mines and Mining Development, after touring the plant in June. Wilfred Motsi, project director for the Dinson Group, said the development marks a huge milestone in Zimbabwe's manufacturing industry. 'We are going back to our glory days when Zimbabwe was known as one of the industrial hubs in southern Africa because of the opening of the steel industry,' said Dinson Group project director, Wilfred Motsi, told Chinese state news agency, Xinhua in June. Food insecurity and the environment Despite promises of infrastructure development, including roads and housing, residents said there has been a lack of progress. There is fear that the displacement is exacerbating an already fragile existence among the villagers. In August, the UN described levels of food insecurity in Zimbabwe as 'rapidly deteriorating after it was hit with historic droughts.' Chenjerai Mushore, chairman of three affected villages, echoed these concerns, highlighting the ongoing environmental challenges and a slow compensation process. Mushore claimed that the mine’s road resurfacing project has led to dust pollution. He emphasized the urgent need to complete the road project to mitigate these risks. Response to concerns DISCO’s spokesperson, Joseph Shoko has denied any wrongdoing and told VOA the company is committed to environmental compliance and is investing in state-of-the-art sewage ponds and chimneys. Since the villagers' farmlands are now within the perimeter of the steel plant, Shoko said DISCO has also been supporting 22 seniors who are considered the head of households with US $200 a month for food since February until they are relocated to a new place to live. Shoko told VOA there are also plans to support six additional heads of households. Shoko added that younger residents are offered job opportunities instead of monetary assistance. Additionally, the company is prioritizing these residents for employment opportunities as they await relocation, he said. According to Mushore and Shoko the mine is building new homes in a designated relocation area to accommodate the displaced community. Shoko further explained that compensation evaluations involving government ministries are currently underway. 'The final compensation amount will be determined by these ministries following a thorough assessment,' Shoko concluded. Chitando, Zimbabwe’s minister of mines, has not responded to VOA’s request for comment. Zimbabwe-Sino relationship Zimbabwe and China have maintained a strong alliance over the years. The relationship deepened significantly when Western nations imposed economic sanctions on Zimbabwe during Robert Mugabe's presidency. As international funding and investment declined, China emerged as a major supporter. Under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe and China elevated their partnership to a strategic level in 2018. This move facilitated increased Chinese investment, particularly in the extractive industries. However, the DISCO steel plant has been criticized by environmental and human rights activists for its potential negative impact on the environment. Zimbabwe’s environmental standards agency, the Environmental Management Authority, or EMA, is working with the Steel Mine in addressing the issues which were raised by activists and villagers said the agency’s Environmental Education and Publicity manager, Amkela Sidange. She said EMA is closely overseeing the implementation of abatement measures outlined in a previous environmental audit. In response to VOA's request for comment, the EMA said that there are currently no environmental violations at the Dinson-Manhize plant; however, 'monitoring the progression on implementation of abatement measures proposed on environmental compliance during a previous Environmental Audit by the Agency at the same plant' was conducted a few months ago. The EMA said the steel company has been addressing issues identified in the audit, including upgrades to the access road from Dinson to Mavise into a tarred road to further reduce dust. The company is applying for necessary environmental licenses, including for effluent disposal and air emissions, the EMA said, adding that it will continue to monitor the plant 'to ensure they are completed within set time frames and ensure the project development is done in a manner that does not harm the environment or health of the public.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-steel-plant-zimbabwe-s-economic-boon-or-environmental-nightmare-/7845150.html	2024-10-30T11:45:21-07:00	
Concerns about Musk, Putin conversations still cause concern	WASHINGTON — Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has been talking on a consistent basis with Russian President Vladimir Putin are still reverberating among current and former U.S. officials, almost a week after news of the conversations first surfaced. Musk, who owns electric car maker Tesla and the X social media platform, also owns SpaceX, a commercial spaceflight company that has numerous contracts with the U.S. government, doing work for the Department of Defense and U.S. space agency NASA. Some of that work is so sensitive that the United States has given Musk high-level security clearances due to his knowledge of the programs, raising concerns among some that top secret U.S. information and capabilities could be at risk. According to current and former U.S., European and Russian officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, such concerns may be warranted. During one conversation, those officials said, Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary that provides satellite internet services, over Taiwan as a favor to China. 'I think it should be investigated,' NASA administrator Bill Nelson told the Semafor World Economy Summit on Friday, a day after The Journal published its report. 'I don’t know that that story is true,' Nelson said, adding, if it is, 'I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.' Russia and Musk deny frequent calls Musk has previously denied frequent calls with Putin. In 2022, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader just once, but The Journal said there have been repeated conversations since then. Musk has not commented or responded to the Journal article on X. Russia has also denied there have been frequent conversations between Putin and Musk. The Pentagon has so far declined to refute or confirm the allegations. 'We have seen the reporting from The Wall Street Journal but cannot corroborate the veracity of those reports,' Defense Department spokesperson Sue Gough told VOA in an email late Friday. '[We] would refer you to Mr. Musk to speak to his private communications,' Gough said, adding that, by law, the department does not comment on the details or status of anyone’s security clearance. 'We expect everyone who has been granted a security clearance, including contractors, to follow the prescribed procedures for reporting foreign contacts,' she said. Former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to VOA said the reported conversations, since confirmed by other U.S. news organizations citing their own confidential sources, raise significant questions. 'There is no doubt that Russia is cultivating many possible channels of influence in the United States and other Western countries,' said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University. 'Russia would regard a wealthy and influential business mogul such as Musk as potentially a highly useful channel and thus a relationship worth nurturing,' he said. Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior director of the White House Situation Room, is also wary. 'It does get the spider-sense tingling,' he told VOA. 'If the reports of Musk’s repeated conversations with Vladimir Putin are true, I would definitely have some concerns,' Pfeiffer said. 'Russia under Putin will cultivate support wherever it can be bought, cajoled or coerced. 'Putin has equal opportunity security services that will take advantage of any opportunity to get foreign business leaders to influence their governments to align with Russian interests,' he said. Concerns don't equal wrongdoing Former officials like Pillar and Pfeiffer, though, caution there is a difference between concerns and actual wrongdoing. Other former officials note that even if Musk engaged in conversations that could make some in government uncomfortable, just having those conversations is not necessarily illegal. 'Americans are allowed to talk to essentially whomever they want,' said a former national security prosecutor, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. 'There's no inherent limitation.' And in the case of a high-profile individual who oversees companies with global reach, conversations with foreign officials could be unavoidable. 'For a businessman, there may be commercially legitimate reasons to have those communications,' the former prosecutor said. 'It's when a businessman is having those communications, perhaps for political reasons or even proto-diplomatic reasons, that it gets probably more concerning from a counterintelligence perspective.' There also may not be any legal issues with a potential failure by someone like Musk to voluntarily disclose conversations with foreign leaders. Hiding such conversations when asked about them, however, could wade into criminal territory. Still, given the value the U.S. gets from Musk’s companies, U.S. officials may feel like they have little recourse. 'It is one of those unfair things in life that if the government has a unique need for you, you can get away with more and still get a security clearance,' the former prosecutor said. 'Someone who has unique value is going to get more accommodation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/concerns-about-musk-putin-conversations-still-cause-concern/7845082.html	2024-10-30T10:56:11-07:00	
Rival campaign merchandise sellers try lowering political temperature	In the U.S. presidential campaign, there is little to agree on between supporters of Kamala Harris and supporters of Donald Trump.

Botswana's president defends electoral body as nation votes	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi is defending the country’s electoral body amid criticism of its preparedness as voting began Wednesday. Critics said some polling stations opened late, there weren’t enough stations to handle the number of voters, and lines were long. Masisi, who is seeking a second and final term, told journalists after casting his vote in his home village of Moshupa, southwest of Gaborone, that he is confident of victory. The election will determine the makeup of parliament, and lawmakers will later elect the president. Masisi also said he was content with the conduct of the Independent Electoral Commission, which has faced criticism from opposition parties on how it has handled the pre-election period. He said any appearance that the IEC is not independent of his executive branch is 'really almost cosmetic,' explaining that the government budget process requires the executive branch to present a budget on behalf of all other areas of the government, including the judiciary. 'Some are suggesting for the IEC to be independent,' Masisi said, '[that] they must go to parliament to present [their own] budget. But they are not members of parliament. How do you get an independent body to account to politicians?' Voting began with some polling stations opening late. IEC spokesperson Osupile Maroba acknowledged the difficulties but said they were resolved early enough to allow voters to cast their ballots. On the eve of the election, opposition parties took the IEC to court, questioning the electoral commission’s readiness. Maroba said the parties were within their rights to seek the intervention of the courts. 'We are dealing with a sensitive emotive process that will always bring about complaints,' Maroba said. 'It will bring about challenges that will lead to going to the courts. As the laws of Botswana allow, anybody who is not happy with a process has a way to try and seek redress.' Meanwhile, Masisi said the time spent at the polling stations could be improved through a digital voting system. Some voters were at the polling stations as early as 4 a.m. One voter, Mosedi Kenosi, said he ran out of patience due to the slow process. 'Maybe I will go back later,' he said. 'The process has been slow. I waited for more than three hours to vote. The verification process takes forever, which discourages voters.' The elections come as the country faces an economic downturn due to weak global diamond sales. The opposition has criticized Masisi’s party, the Botswana Democratic Party, for failing to provide solutions. Polling stations were expected to close at 7 p.m., with early results expected Thursday morning. This story includes information from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-president-defends-electoral-body-as-nation-votes/7845002.html	2024-10-30T10:12:34-07:00	
Britain identifies its first case of new mpox variant	LONDON — Britain has detected its first case of new mpox variant clade Ib, the country's health security agency (UKHSA) said Wednesday, adding that the risk to the population remained low. The clade Ib variant is a new form of the virus that was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in August after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to neighboring countries in Africa. The case, in a patient who had recently traveled to affected countries in Africa, was detected in London and the individual has been transferred to a specialist hospital, the UKHSA said. Close contacts of the case are being followed up by UKHSA and partner organizations, the UKHSA added. There have been cases of mpox clade Ib reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Sweden, India and Germany, as well as Congo. It is a different form of the virus from clade II, which spread globally in 2022, largely among men who have sex with men. Mpox is a viral infection that typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and while usually mild it can kill. Clade Ib is thought to cause more severe disease than clade II. Both forms can be transmitted through close physical contact, including sexual contact. The United Kingdom authorities said they would not provide any more details about the patient, but added that the person's contacts were being followed up and would be offered testing and vaccination as needed, as well as further care if they test positive or have symptoms. According to the latest WHO figures, there have been more than 44,000 confirmed and suspected cases of mpox in Africa this year, and more than 1,000 deaths, largely in Congo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-identifies-its-first-case-of-new-mpox-variant/7844927.html	2024-10-30T09:12:21-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic State militants	The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group. The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of large swaths of the two countries. U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt the group's ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-target-multiple-sites-in-syria-killing-up-to-35-islamic-state-militants/7844913.html	2024-10-30T09:09:32-07:00	
Indians mark Diwali by lighting record number of earthen lamps	LUCKNOW, INDIA — Millions of Indians began celebrating the annual Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, by symbolically lighting a record 2.51 million earthen oil lamps at dusk on Wednesday on the banks of the Saryu River in a northern Indian city they believe to be the birthplace of the deity Lord Ram. Diwali is the most important festival of the year in India — for the Hindu majority in particular. It is marked by socializing and exchanging gifts with loved ones. Many light earthen oil lamps and candles, and fireworks are set off. In the evening, a special prayer is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring luck and prosperity. A Guinness World Records team presented a certificate to Uttar Pradesh state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, acknowledging the unprecedented number of oil lamps, exceeding last year's 2.2 million. Drone cameras closely monitored the event. The celebrations took place within the northern city of Ayodhya where Prime Minister Narendra Modi nine months ago opened a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque following a Supreme Court decision, seen as a political win for the populist leader. The establishment of the temple dedicated to Lord Ram fulfilled a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus. On Wednesday, thousands of volunteers lit lamps, called 'Diyas,' along riverbanks, lanes, fronts and roofs of homes. 'More than 30,000 volunteers, primarily college students, worked meticulously to maintain the systematic pattern of burning lamps for the prescribed time,' said Dr. Pratibha Goyal, vice chancellor of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, who coordinated the massive effort. The earthen lamps lit along 55 riverfront steps of the river Saryu created a captivating display throughout 1.5 kilometers (1 mile). As the lamps remained lit for over five minutes, government spokesperson Shishir Singh said Ayodhya achieved its seventh consecutive world record for the largest display. Singh said that around 91,000 liters of mustard oil were used to light the lamps. The event transformed Ayodhya into a city of lights amid devotional bhajan singing. A laser show depicting scenes from the epic Ramayana added to the immersive experience, and an eco-friendly fireworks show lit the skyline. Traditional decorations, including elaborate arches and grand gateways along the main highways, were in abundance, capturing the festive atmosphere as folk cultural performances drew pilgrims to the streets. The festival also featured a massive praying ceremony performed by 1,100 priests along riverbanks. Security was tightened across the city. Paramilitary commandos, bomb detectors, dog squads, face-recognition technology and monitoring drones were deployed throughout the city, police officer Rajkaran Nayyar said. Major Hindu festivals such as Dussehra and Diwali are associated with tales of Lord Ram extolling the virtues of truth, sacrifice and ethical governance. Diwali's main festival celebrations will be held across the country on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indians-mark-diwali-by-lighting-record-number-of-earthen-lamps/7844903.html	2024-10-30T09:07:00-07:00	
Harris promises to 'represent all Americans' after Biden 'garbage' remark	WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris said she disagrees 'with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,' reacting after U.S. President Joe Biden's reference to Donald Trump's supporters and 'garbage.' 'I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me,' the vice president said. Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, made the comment to reporters as she prepared to campaign in three states. Her words were an attempt to blunt the controversy over Biden's rhetoric with less than a week until the end of the campaign. The tumult began Tuesday night around the time that Harris was delivering a unifying message in a speech near the White House. Inside the building, Biden was criticizing Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian described Puerto Rico as an 'island of garbage.' 'The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American,' Biden said in a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino. 'It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.' Biden and the White House rushed to explain that the president was talking about the rhetoric on stage, not Trump's supporters themselves. But Republicans seized on Biden's comments, claiming they were an echo of the time when Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nominee against Trump in 2016, said half of Trump's supporters belong to a 'basket of deplorables.' In attacking Biden, and by extension, Harris, Republicans are glossing over Trump's own history of insulting and demonizing rhetoric, such as calling the United States a 'garbage can for the world' or describing political opponents as 'the enemy within.' Trump has also described Harris as a 'stupid person' and 'lazy as hell,' and he's questioned whether she was on drugs. Trump has also refused demands to apologize for the comment about Puerto Rico at his rally, acknowledging 'somebody said some bad things' but 'I can't imagine it's a big deal.' Political attack lines have a history of occasionally boomeranging back on people who use them. For example, Ohio Senantor JD Vance, now Trump's running mate, once described Democrats as beholden to 'a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.' Vance's three-year-old comments were resurfaced once he became the vice presidential nominee, energizing Harris supporters who repurposed the label as a point of pride on shirts and bumper stickers — much like Trump's supporters once cheerfully branded themselves as 'deplorables.' On Wednesday morning, Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, downplayed Biden's comments in television interviews. He told 'CBS Mornings' that Biden 'was very clear that he's speaking about the rhetoric we heard,' not the supporters themselves. Walz made a similar comment on ABC's 'Good Morning America,' where he emphasized that Democrats' inclusive message.

US cracks down on Russia’s sanctions evasion in fresh action	WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday imposed curbs on hundreds of targets in fresh action against Russia, taking aim at sanctions circumvention in a signal that the U.S. is committed to countering evasion. The action, taken by the U.S. Treasury and State departments, imposed sanctions on nearly 400 entities and people from over a dozen countries, according to statements from the Treasury and State departments. The action was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion, a State Department official told Reuters. It included sanctions on dozens of Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian companies, the most from those countries to be hit in one package so far, according to the official. Also hit with sanctions were targets in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland and elsewhere. The action comes as Washington has sought to curb Russia's evasion of the sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble. The U.S. has repeatedly warned against supplying Russia with Common High Priority Items — advanced components that include microelectronics deemed by the U.S. and European Union as likely to be used for Russia's war in Ukraine. 'This should send a serious message to both the governments and the private sectors of these countries that the U.S. government is committed to countering the evasion of our sanctions against Russia and to continue putting pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine,' the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 274 targets, while the State Department designated more than 120. The U.S. Commerce Department added 40 companies and research institutions to a trade restriction list over their alleged support of the Russian military. 'The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine,' Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement. A senior administration official said Wednesday's action was designed to signal the U.S. would act against Indian companies if progress were not made through communication. 'With India, we have been very direct and blunt with them about the concerns we have about what we see as sort of emerging trends in that country that we want to stop before they get too far down the road,' the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. India-based Futrevo was among the companies targeted by the State Department, which accused it of being involved in the supply of high-priority items to the Russia-based manufacturer of Orlan drones. The Treasury also targeted Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited, which it said since 2023 has sent hundreds of shipments of U.S.-trademarked technology to Russia, totaling tens of millions of dollars. A second senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday that more than 70% of the high-priority goods getting to Russia was from China, more than an estimated $22 billion worth since the start of the war. 'That's over 13 times the next largest supplier,' the official said, which as of the end of 2023 was Turkey. Among those targeted Wednesday were Hong Kong and China-based companies involved in the shipment of tens of millions of dollars’ worth of high-priority items to Russia-based companies or end-users, the State and Treasury departments said. The U.S. also took actions on a variety of entities supporting Russia's Arctic project, which is 60% owned by Russia's Novatek and was to become Russia's largest liquefied natural gas plant. Novatek has been forced to scale back Arctic, which had been planned to reach an eventual output of 19.8 million metric tons per year, following a raft of U.S. sanctions starting in 2023 with additional measures in August and September. But the U.S. held back from using an executive order signed by President Joe Biden last year that threatened penalties for financial institutions that help Russia circumvent sanctions. The senior administration official said banking sectors had taken notice of the authority and sort of moved into compliance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cracks-down-on-russia-s-sanctions-evasion-in-fresh-action/7844808.html	2024-10-30T08:06:41-07:00	
Supreme Court allows Virginia to resume purge of voter registrations	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to resume its purge of voter registrations that the state says is aimed at stopping people who are not U.S. citizens from voting. The justices, over the dissents of the three liberal justices, granted an emergency appeal from Virginia's Republican administration led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The court provided no rationale for its action, which is typical in emergency appeals. The justices acted on Virginia's appeal after a federal judge found that the state illegally purged more than 1,600 voter registrations in the past two months. A federal appeals court had previously allowed the judge's order to remain in effect. Such voting is rare in American elections, but the specter of immigrants voting illegally has been a main part of the political messaging this year from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Trump had criticized the earlier ruling, calling it 'a totally unacceptable travesty' on social media. 'Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote,' Trump wrote. The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued the state earlier in October, arguing that Virginia election officials, acting on an executive order issued in August by Youngkin were striking names from voter rolls in violation of federal election law. The National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day 'quiet period' ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls so that legitimate voters are not removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or last-minute mistakes that cannot be quickly corrected. Youngkin issued his order on Aug. 7, the 90th day before the election. It required daily checks of data from the state Department of Motor Vehicles against voter rolls to identify people who are not U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles said elections officials still could remove names on an individualized basis, but not through a systematic purge. Court records indicated that at least some of those whose registrations were removed are U.S. citizens. Giles had ordered the state to notify affected voters and local registrars by Wednesday that the registrations have been restored. Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. In a similar lawsuit in Alabama, a federal judge this month ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-allows-virginia-to-resume-purge-of-voter-registrations-/7844785.html	2024-10-30T07:45:57-07:00	
RFE/RL journalist marks 5 months jailed in Azerbaijan	An Azerbaijani journalist with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty on Wednesday marked five months since he was detained in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, on charges his employer rejects. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist for RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service, Radio Azadliq, was abducted in Baku by unidentified men on May 30 and has been in pretrial detention since June 1. 'Today marks five months since RFE/RL journalist and economist Farid Mehralizada was unjustly detained in Azerbaijan. We are deeply concerned by his continued imprisonment on false charges,' RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement Wednesday. On June 1, a Baku court placed Mehralizada under pretrial detention for 'conspiring to smuggle foreign currency' in connection with a case brought against the independent media outlet Abzas Media. Then in August, authorities brought new charges against Mehralizada, accusing him of 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He faces up to 12 years behind bars for all the charges against him. RFE/RL has called for Mehralizada’s release. 'We call for his immediate release so he can return home to his wife and newborn daughter,' Capus said in the statement. On the day of Mehralizada’s initial detention, authorities raided his home and seized a car, a computer and mobile phones, according to RFE/RL. In September, Mehralizada’s pretrial detention was extended until mid-December. The indictment, which doesn’t mention Radio Azadliq, also fails to establish a clear link between Mehralizada and Abzas Media. Meanwhile, Abzas Media has said Mehralizada’s involvement with the outlet was limited to offering expert commentary. Abzas Media is one of the few remaining independent outlets in Azerbaijan. It is known for its coverage of corruption, including allegations linked to the country’s ruling family. More than a dozen journalists are jailed in Azerbaijan on charges viewed as politically motivated, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Several Abzas Media journalists are among those jailed. Twenty-five civil society groups, including CPJ and Reporters Without Borders, have called for all the defendants in the Abzas Media case to be released. Mehralizada’s jailing underscores the poor state of press freedom in Azerbaijan, where the government has long cracked down on criticism. On the 2024 Global Press Freedom Index, Azerbaijan ranks 164 out of 180 countries in terms of media freedom. Azerbaijan’s Washington Embassy and Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. Azerbaijan’s government has targeted RFE/RL’s Azerbaijani Service for years. Radio Azadliq was banned from broadcasting on FM frequencies in 2009, and its Baku bureau was raided and shut down in 2014. The service’s website was blocked three years later in 2017. Former Bureau Chief Khadija Ismayilova was arrested and jailed for 18 months in 2014, and in 2021, Azerbaijani authorities used Pegasus spyware to target at least five Radio Azadliq journalists, according to RFE/RL. Mehralizada is one of four RFE/RL journalists currently jailed for their work. The others are Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk in Belarus, and Vladyslav Yesypenko in Russian-occupied Crimea. RFE/RL rejects the charges against all of them as false.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rfe-rl-journalist-marks-5-months-jailed-in-azerbaijan/7844748.html	2024-10-30T07:45:49-07:00	
US economy grew at a solid 2.8% pace last quarter on strength of consumer spending	Washington — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the weight of still-high interest rates. Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy's total output of goods and services — did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third quarter's growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate. On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged. The report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy has continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. Wednesday's report contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Fed's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris' prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump's policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation. At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. The central bank's policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7844694.html	2024-10-30T06:50:17-07:00	
Cambodian archaeologists discover centuries-old statues at Angkor	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — Archaeologists in Cambodia have unearthed a dozen centuries-old sandstone statues in a 'remarkable discovery' at the Angkor World Heritage Site near the city of Siem Reap, authorities said Wednesday. The statues — depicting 'door guardians' — were discovered last week near the north gate leading to the 11th-century Royal Palace at Angkor Thom, the last capital of the Khmer Empire, said Long Kosal, spokesperson for the Apsara National Authority, the government agency that oversees the archaeological park. Teams were assessing the ancient gate's structure and searching for fallen stones around the portal on the north side of Angkor Thom, one of four entrances to the complex, when the discovery was made. The statues depict guardians standing at attention and vary in size from about 1 meter to 110 centimeters (about 39 to 43 inches). They were found buried at depths of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 feet), and some are in surprisingly good shape, with each featuring unique facial hair ornaments, adding to their distinctiveness, archaeologist Sorn Chanthorn said. 'Experts believe these door guardian statues exemplify the Khneang Style, aligning with the construction period of the 11th-century palace.' the Apsara National Authority said. Angkor Thom is part of the Angkor Archaeological Park, a complex that sprawls over some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 and one of Southeast Asia's most popular tourist destinations. It contains the ruins of Khmer Empire capitals from the 9th to 15th centuries, including the temple of Angkor Wat. The site, near Siem Reap, about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the capital, Phnom Penh, drew more than 500,000 international visitors in the first half of 2024, according to Cambodia's Tourism Ministry. The archaeological dig was a collaborative project between Apsara and the China-Cambodia Government Team for Safeguarding Angkor, Apsara said. Following the discovery of the statues, the archaeological team carefully documented their positions before removing them for cleaning and restoration. They will eventually be returned to their original locations, authorities said. Many Khmer cultural treasures were looted during the long period of civil war and instability when Cambodia was ruled by the brutal communist Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s. Cambodia has benefited from a trend that in recent decades has seen the repatriation of art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. In August, it celebrated the return of dozens of artifacts from museums and private collections abroad. It has also come under criticism for efforts to clean up the Angkor site, which has involved relocating thousands of families in what Amnesty International has condemned as a 'gross violation of international human rights law.' At its meeting in July, the U.N.'s World Heritage Committee recommended that Cambodia invite a new team of experts to monitor the situation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-archaeologists-discover-centuries-old-statues-at-angkor/7844674.html	2024-10-30T06:37:24-07:00	
Pakistan hires 2 law firms to fight Iran's pipeline delay claim	Islamabad — Pakistan has hired two U.S.-based law firms to represent it at the International Court of Arbitration as it fights Iran’s bid to force the neighbor country to uphold its end of a gas pipeline deal or pay a large penalty. Tehran and Islamabad signed a gas sales and purchase agreement (GSPA) in June 2009 for a cross-border pipeline that would supply as much as a billion cubic feet per day of gas to energy-starved Pakistan from Iran’s South Pars Field. However, Pakistan has not started construction of the pipeline on its territory, primarily to avoid invoking U.S. sanctions. In August, Pakistani media reported Tehran served Islamabad a final notice ahead of approaching the Paris-based arbitration body. The two law firms; Wilkie Farr and Gallagher, and White & Case, will represent Pakistan in arbitration proceedings, a highly placed source in the Office of the Attorney General of Pakistan confirmed to VOA Wednesday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Islamabad reportedly faces a penalty of up to $18 billion for delaying the project. Background In 2011, Iran announced it had completed construction of 900 kilometers of the pipeline on its side of the border between the two countries. Two years later, Iran’s then-president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and Pakistan’s President, Asif Ali Zardari, inaugurated the $7 billion project on Iranian territory. In 2014, Pakistan asked for a 10-year extension on the project to avoid paying a penalty of up to $1 million per day starting in 2015. In March 2024, close to the end of the extension period, Pakistan’s outgoing interim government rushed to approve construction of an 80-kilometer section of the pipeline from its border with Iran into the key southwestern port town of Gwadar in Balochistan province. However, construction is yet to begin. Last month, Pakistan’s minister for petroleum, Musadik Malik, told parliament that international sanctions stood in the way of proceeding with the cross-border pipeline. 'This is a deeply complicated matter and involves international sanctions,' the minister said. He rejected reports that the country could face a penalty of $18 billion but did not give a figure. Hours before the minister’s remarks, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller reiterated Washington’s warning against doing business with Tehran. 'We will continue to enforce our sanctions against Iran. We also advise anyone considering a business deal with Iran to be aware of its possible ramifications,' the spokesperson said at a regular media briefing. Iran is under U.S. sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. At times, Pakistan has signaled it will defy U.S. warnings but apparently has not done so operationally or publicly. Although Pakistan can construct a pipeline within its border, it requires a sanctions waiver from Washington to purchase gas from Iran. Islamabad has not acquired the waiver.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hires-two-law-firms-to-fight-iran-s-pipeline-delay-claim-/7844624.html	2024-10-30T06:23:04-07:00	
US experts see Pyongyang's Russia gambit as no-win situation for China	China's response to Russia's growing influence over North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un, likely combines 'exasperation' and 'panic' as Beijing appears to be losing control over its client state, according to former U.S. policy and intelligence officials. They noted that the explicit security partnership between China's two neighbors —Russia and North Korea — could undermine China's strategic position in East Asia and has long-term implications that are not beneficial for China. On Wednesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced that North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will hold 'strategic consultations' in Moscow with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, as the United States, South Korea, and NATO express alarm that Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to train in Russia. U.S. officials believe Russia intends to use North Korean soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. South Korea has condemned that as a significant security threat to the international community. In Beijing, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko held talks Wednesday, with Wang reaffirming the strong ties between the two nations. The officials exchanged views on Ukraine but did not disclose details of their discussion. But Chinese officials have avoided direct comments on North Korea dispatching thousands of troops to Russia. 'China calls for all parties to deescalate the situation and strive for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. This position remains unchanged,' Lin Jian, a spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, repeated Beijing's stance during a briefing on Tuesday. China's panic 'The radio silence in Beijing on this subject is staggering,' said Dennis Wilder, a former senior intelligence official with the CIA. Wilder said Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to say anything publicly as he faces an unpredictable Kim Jong Un. 'The Chinese have been very careful about nuclear assistance to the North Koreans, keeping them on IV drip of economic support so North Korea remains stable. But if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin goes down the road of nuclear assistance, this will bolster the American alliances in East Asia, maybe creating a true NATO.' 'And so [Chinese President Xi Jinping is] in a very, very difficult spot,' said Wilder during a seminar hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday. Wilder suggested that the U.S. could leverage its intelligence channels with China for joint data collection and analysis. Former White House national security council senior official Victor Cha said that by sending troops, North Korea is making a 'downpayment' to Russia on a mutual security partnership — something Pyongyang could never secure from Beijing. In China, he said, 'There's probably a combination of a little bit of exasperation, a little bit of panic and a little bit of they don't know what to do with regard to the current situation. 'The panic is that Russia now has arguably much more influence over North Korea than China does,' added Cha, who is currently president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department at CSIS. Both Wilder and Cha served on former U.S. president George W. Bush's National Security Council. Language barrier Other military analysts noted that while North Korean soldiers could gain real-world experience in combat operations simply by deploying to another country, they would also encounter significant challenges. 'You also have an immense language problem,' said Colonel Mark Cancian, who spent over three decades in the U.S. Marine Corps and is now a senior adviser with the CSIS International Security Program. He questioned how a group of North Koreans could effectively integrate with a Russian military unit and communicate and operate together. The possibility of Russia transferring technology related to ballistic missiles, air defenses and nuclear weapons to North Korea is 'probably the most dangerous' scenario from the U.S. point of view, according to Cancian. Violation of UNSC resolutions On Tuesday, U.S. officials disputed Russian foreign minister Lavrov's assertion that military assistance between Russia and North Korea does not violate international law. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday that 'Russia's training of DPRK soldiers involving arms or related material,' as well as 'any training or assistance involving DPRK soldiers in the use of ballistic missiles or other arms,' constitutes a direct violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol announced plans to exchange delegations to coordinate actions and share intelligence regarding North Korean troop deployments to Russia. This week, Kyiv's special envoy to South Korea will begin talks with South Korean officials. In Washington, U.S. officials said they would welcome increased South Korean support for Ukraine. The South Korean government indicated that it would consider sending 'weapons for defense and attack' and may also dispatch military and intelligence personnel to Ukraine to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and assist in interrogations of captured North Koreans. 'We, of course, welcome any country supporting our Ukrainian partners as they continue to defend their territorial integrity and sovereignty,' State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during a recent briefing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7844644.html	2024-10-30T06:06:21-07:00	
France allows six Russian army deserters, and partners, to enter country, apply for asylum	London — Thousands of Russians, including soldiers, have fled their country to seek asylum in the West since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, although only a fraction of asylum applications has been approved. However, in a landmark case, France has allowed several Russian army deserters to enter the country to seek refugee status. Anti-war activists hope it will prompt more Russian soldiers to flee. Alexander, who does not want to give his family name for fear of political retaliation, is among the six Russian men and four of their partners permitted to enter France in recent months. He and his wife, Irina, are now living in the French city of Caen as they await a court decision on their asylum applications. In January 2022, as Russia was preparing its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Alexander recounted that he was told to go to Russian-occupied Crimea for military exercises. He did not want to go — but was told he had no choice. Instead, his unit crossed the border into Ukraine as part of the invasion force. 'I was personally in shock; I didn't understand what was happening,' Alexander told Agence France-Presse in an interview. 'We had just crossed the border into Ukraine. I went to see my commander and asked him: 'What's going on? Why are we here? Why have we crossed the border? Why are we on the territory of another country?' ... I didn't get any answers to my questions.' Alexander eventually managed to flee the army. 'I realized then that I only had two choices: either leave Russia or go to prison. Because going back to the front — I didn't have the slightest desire, nor the moral possibility,' he said. 'Maybe, thanks to my example, someone will be inspired and want to quit the army. The weaker the army at the front is, the fewer people there are, the quicker the war will end and Ukraine will win,' the 26-year-old told AFP. Alexander and Irina initially fled to Kazakhstan, where they connected with other Russians escaping the war. However, many Russian exiles say they don't feel safe in former Soviet countries. Army deserters face 10 years or more in prison if caught and returned to Russia. A French court ruled in 2023 that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status, but most are not able to travel abroad to lodge an asylum application, said Ian Bond, a Russia expert and deputy director of the Centre for European Reform. 'It's relatively easy for Russians still to get to countries in the former Soviet Union. Russians have two passports — they have an internal passport and some have a foreign passport. Particularly for people of military age or active servicemen, even getting their hands on a foreign passport is extremely difficult,' Bond told VOA. But France granted permission for Alexander and Irina, along with eight other Russians, to enter the country and apply for asylum. It's believed they arrived in Paris on separate flights from Kazakhstan without passports or travel documents, although the exact details of their journeys have not been released. 'There are a number of ways in which they could have gotten to France, and I think they're not the first Russian deserters to get asylum in the West. But this seems to be a larger group — rather than in the past [when] I think there have just been some scattered individuals,' said analyst Bond. The decision followed months of advocacy and campaigning by organizations like Paris-based Russie-Libertes, which encourage Russians to desert the army. The groups say the deserters were meticulously vetted for their anti-war stance. Olga Prokopieva, the head of Russie-Libertes, said France's decision to allow the group of army deserters into the country was 'unprecedented' and urged other European countries to follow suit. 'It has taken us a year of talks. We have tried so many things,' she told Agence France-Presse. However, Prokopieva told VOA via email on October 29 that Russie-Libertes would no longer be commenting on or publicizing the case, an indication of the sensitivity of the asylum applications. Get Lost, a Georgia-based organization that helps Russians flee their country, claims to have aided more than 38,000 people, including thousands of soldiers. It also helped Alexander and Irina, along with the eight other Russians allowed to enter France. Many European nations will have security concerns, said Ian Bond of the Centre for European Reform. 'There will be some, maybe in eastern Europe, who will say Russians are always a security risk; we should not be encouraging this. There will be others, and I would be among them, who would say the more people that we can encourage to leave Russia, the more acute [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's shortage of manpower will be — not just for the armed forces, but also for the military industrial complex.' 'I think the fact that Russia has brought some thousands of North Korean troops to the battlefield is an indication that the manpower shortage is really starting to bite. But certainly, you'll have to scrutinize these people quite closely to make sure that you aren't importing Russian special forces disguised as deserters,' Bond told VOA. It's not clear if France intends to allow more Russian deserters to enter the country and claim asylum. The French foreign ministry did not respond to VOA requests for comment. Since fleeing Russia, deserter Alexander and Irina have created a YouTube channel aimed at other Russian soldiers. 'Maybe with the help of this YouTube channel, the soldiers who have already taken this step, who have left their unit, Russia, the conflict zone, will be able to pass on these ideas to those who are still there, who are at a crossroads, who decide to flee or stay,' Irina said. Sergei, another of the Russian deserters permitted to enter France, said Russian soldiers always have a choice. 'There is always a possibility to lay down your arms, not to kill other people and to end your participation in this war,' the 27-year-old told AFP.

The weaker the army at the front is, the fewer people there are, the quicker the war will end and Ukraine will win,' the 26-year-old told AFP. Alexander and Irina initially fled to Kazakhstan, where they connected with other Russians escaping the war. However, many Russian exiles say they don't feel safe in former Soviet countries. Army deserters face 10 years or more in prison if caught and returned to Russia. A French court ruled in 2023 that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status, but most are not able to travel abroad to lodge an asylum application, said Ian Bond, a Russia expert and deputy director of the Centre for European Reform. 'It's relatively easy for Russians still to get to countries in the former Soviet Union. Russians have two passports — they have an internal passport and some have a foreign passport. Particularly for people of military age or active servicemen, even getting their hands on a foreign passport is extremely difficult,' Bond told VOA. But France granted permission for Alexander and Irina, along with eight other Russians, to enter the country and apply for asylum. It's believed they arrived in Paris on separate flights from Kazakhstan without passports or travel documents, although the exact details of their journeys have not been released. 'There are a number of ways in which they could have gotten to France, and I think they're not the first Russian deserters to get asylum in the West. But this seems to be a larger group — rather than in the past [when] I think there have just been some scattered individuals,' said analyst Bond. The decision followed months of advocacy and campaigning by organizations like Paris-based Russie-Libertes, which encourage Russians to desert the army. The groups say the deserters were meticulously vetted for their anti-war stance. Olga Prokopieva, the head of Russie-Libertes, said France's decision to allow the group of army deserters into the country was 'unprecedented' and urged other European countries to follow suit. 'It has taken us a year of talks. We have tried so many things,' she told Agence France-Presse. However, Prokopieva told VOA via email on October 29 that Russie-Libertes would no longer be commenting on or publicizing the case, an indication of the sensitivity of the asylum applications. Get Lost, a Georgia-based organization that helps Russians flee their country, claims to have aided more than 38,000 people, including thousands of soldiers. It also helped Alexander and Irina, along with the eight other Russians allowed to enter France. Many European nations will have security concerns, said Ian Bond of the Centre for European Reform. 'There will be some, maybe in eastern Europe, who will say Russians are always a security risk; we should not be encouraging this. There will be others, and I would be among them, who would say the more people that we can encourage to leave Russia, the more acute [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's shortage of manpower will be — not just for the armed forces, but also for the military industrial complex.' 'I think the fact that Russia has brought some thousands of North Korean troops to the battlefield is an indication that the manpower shortage is really starting to bite. But certainly, you'll have to scrutinize these people quite closely to make sure that you aren't importing Russian special forces disguised as deserters,' Bond told VOA. It's not clear if France intends to allow more Russian deserters to enter the country and claim asylum. The French foreign ministry did not respond to VOA requests for comment. Since fleeing Russia, deserter Alexander and Irina have created a YouTube channel aimed at other Russian soldiers. 'Maybe with the help of this YouTube channel, the soldiers who have already taken this step, who have left their unit, Russia, the conflict zone, will be able to pass on these ideas to those who are still there, who are at a crossroads, who decide to flee or stay,' Irina said. Sergei, another of the Russian deserters permitted to enter France, said Russian soldiers always have a choice. 'There is always a possibility to lay down your arms, not to kill other people and to end your participation in this war,' the 27-year-old told AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-allows-six-russian-army-deserters-and-partners-to-enter-country-apply-for-asylum/7844633.html	2024-10-30T05:54:33-07:00	
New York media outlet connects immigrants with news and resources	On a drizzly day in New York's Chinatown, journalist April Xu suggested stopping at a bakery for a snack. 'But not Fay Da,' she said, referring to a bakery on the nearby corner. Xu doesn't go to Fay Da Bakery anymore. Not since she reported on how New York's largest Chinese bakery chain had allegedly stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages from its employees. Many people feel connected to the famous bakery, Xu told VOA. 'When they saw the news, they were shocked,' she said. In April, the bakery agreed to a $940,000 settlement to resolve claims by former and current employees. It was a big story — the kind that the nonprofit media outlet Documented, where she works, likes to tell. Under-covered stories on issues such as wage theft and housing are the focus of this immigrant-focused news outlet. With immigration a polarizing issue in the U.S. presidential election, the news outlet finds itself balancing its typical coverage with debunking false claims. As racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is pushed by the far-right, Documented's team sees their local coverage of immigration as crucial. The inspiration for Documented came from dissatisfaction with how mainstream media often covered immigration, said co-founder Mazin Sidahmed. Born in Sudan, Sidahmed worked for The Guardian in New York and other media before helping set up his own outlet in 2018. 'No one was really covering how those big federal policy shifts were playing out at the local level in big cities like New York, where most immigrants actually live,' Sidahmed told VOA at the outlet's office in the Financial District. 'There was a real hole and a need for a site that was covering how federal immigration policy was playing out locally,' he said. A commitment to meeting the audience's needs has been central to Documented's success, Sidahmed said. Early on, the outlet launched a needs assessment focused on Spanish-speaking audiences. It was hugely successful in figuring out how to best serve that community, according to Sidahmed. They found that respondents felt that they were typically portrayed in the media as either criminals or victims, and they wanted news that would help them navigate government resources. When Documented learned that the community got most of its news from WhatsApp groups, it started a Spanish-language news service on the app. 'Over the past five years, it has really grown into an engine that's driving a lot of our most powerful journalism,' Sidahmed said. 'But getting it to that point was incredibly hard and challenging, and it involved building a lot of trust.' In addition to English and Spanish, Documented publishes in Mandarin and Haitian Creole. To better serve the Chinese community, Documented operates a news account on WeChat. For the Caribbean community, it uses the platform NextDoor. 'We feel that we can't ask people to go to our website to consume news every day. We should deliver the news to them,' Xu said. Platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat are two-way streets. Documented delivers news, and audiences can directly contact reporters with story tips or questions. That way, said Sidahmed, Documented can produce content that is in service of their needs. It also publishes content that helps audiences navigate government bureaucracy or access resources. 'I don't think there's any mainstream news outlet that is really working with immigrants directly in that way, to serve them, as opposed to just covering them,' said Fisayo Okare. Originally from Nigeria, she writes the outlet's newsletter. In 2022, New York City was home to about 3.1 million immigrants — accounting for 38% of the city's total population — according to a report from the mayor's office. Many of Documented's staffers count themselves among that population. Okare thinks their work is enhanced by the team's background. 'As an immigrant myself, I tend to understand what other immigrants are going through,' she said. 'We pride ourselves on not just writing about immigrants but writing for them.' More recently, that has included correcting baseless claims about illegal immigration, including conspiracy theories that candidate Donald Trump repeated about Haitians in Ohio. 'Our role during this time has been to put out the right information whenever just completely wrong or inaccurate information is shared,' Okare said. Documented has also bucked trends in the U.S., where the local news industry has been struggling for years. Over the past two decades, the U.S. has lost more than one-third of its newspapers, according to a 2024 report by Northwestern University's Local News Initiative. Almost 55 million people across the country have limited to no access to local news, the report found. 'When a city loses a local news institution, it has all of these other catastrophic effects on the city. People start to see their local issues in this nationalized lens and don't feel as tethered and connected to their communities,' Sidahmed said. The journalist is optimistic about the future. Documented is aiming to become the leading news source for the communities it is covering in New York, he said. 'We see an opportunity to rebuild local news and rewrite that contract between local news outlets and the communities that have typically had bad relationships with local news,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-media-outlet-connects-immigrants-with-news-and-resources/7844618.html	2024-10-30T05:40:53-07:00	
Beijing files WTO complaint over EU's new taxes on Chinese EVs	Beijing — Beijing said Wednesday it had lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the European Union's decision to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars. The extra taxes of up to 35% were announced Tuesday after an EU probe found Chinese state subsidies were undercutting European automakers, but the move has faced opposition from Germany and Hungary, which fear provoking Beijing's ire and setting off a bitter trade war. China slammed Brussels's decision on Wednesday morning, saying it did not 'agree with or accept' the tariffs and had filed a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism. 'China will... take all necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,' Beijing's commerce ministry said. EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said Tuesday that 'by adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base.' 'We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field,' he said. But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heightened the risk of 'a far-reaching trade conflict,' while a Chinese trade group slammed the 'politically motivated' decision even as it urged dialogue between the two sides. The duties will come on top of the current 10 percent on imports of electric vehicles from China. The decision became law following its publication in the EU's official journal on Tuesday, and the duties will enter into force from Wednesday. Once they do, the tariffs will be definitive and last for five years. The extra duties also apply, at various rates, to vehicles made in China by foreign groups such as Tesla, which faces a tariff of 7.85%. Chinese car giant Geely — one of the country's largest sellers of EVs — faces an extra duty of 18.8%, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. Ailing companies The tariffs do not have the support of the majority of the EU's 27 member states but in a vote early this month, the opposition was not enough to block them, which would have required at least 15 states representing 65% of the bloc's population. The EU launched the probe in a bid to protect its automobile industry, which employs around 14 million people. France, which pushed for the investigation, welcomed the decision. 'The European Union is taking a crucial decision to protect and defend our trade interests, at a time when our car industry needs our support more than ever,' French Finance Minister Antoine Armand said in a statement. But Europe's bigger carmakers, including German auto titan Volkswagen, have criticized the EU's approach and have urged Brussels to resolve the issue through talks. The extra tariffs are 'a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe,' the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said on Tuesday after the announcement. Volkswagen, which has been hit hard by rising competition in China, has previously said the tariffs would not improve the competitiveness of the European automotive industry. That warning came weeks before the ailing giant announced plans on Monday to close at least three factories in Germany and cull tens of thousands of jobs. Retaliatory moves Talks continue between the EU and China, and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences. Discussions have been focused on minimum prices that would replace the duties and force carmakers in China to sell vehicles at a certain cost to offset subsidies. 'We remain open to a possible alternative solution that would be effective in addressing the problems identified and WTO-compatible,' Dombrovskis said. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU urged Brussels and Beijing 'to accelerate talks on establishing minimum prices and, ultimately, to eliminate these tariffs.' The EU could now face Chinese retaliation, with Beijing already saying on October 8 it would impose provisional tariffs on European brandy. Beijing has also launched probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products imported into China. Trade tensions between China and the EU are not limited to electric cars, with Brussels also investigating Chinese subsidies for solar panels and wind turbines. The EU is not alone in levying heavy tariffs on Chinese electric cars. Canada and the United States have in recent months imposed much higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-files-wto-complaint-over-eu-s-new-taxes-on-chinese-evs-/7844561.html	2024-10-30T04:43:48-07:00	
Senegal's president fights for mandate in parliamentary race	Dakar — With fireworks displays, packed rallies, and town-to-town caravans, Senegalese political parties are wooing voters in a parliamentary race that will decide the extent to which the new president will be able to implement his agenda. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye has been under pressure to make good on promises to crack down on corruption and improve livelihoods that helped sweep him to power in April following a landslide election victory the previous month. Faye has accused lawmakers in the opposition-led national assembly of refusing to engage in meaningful talks on the budget and other proposals and dissolved parliament last month, paving the way for the legislative election on Nov. 17. Campaigning officially kicked off on Sunday. Faye's Pastef party is competing for a majority that would secure his mandate, but former ruling parties have formed a rival coalition that unites the country's influential ex-presidents Macky Sall and Abdoulaye Wade. 'This election has symbolic significance,' said political analyst Mamadou Seck. 'The critical challenge today is for Diomaye Faye to understand whether the people who elected him with 54% still support his program.' Earlier in October, the government unveiled an ambitious 25-year development plan that Faye promised would boost local industry, diversify the economy, and create much-needed jobs for the West African country's fast-growing population. The main threat to Pastef's ambitions is the unexpected alliance of Sall's Alliance for the Republic party (APR) and Wade's Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS), who together accounted for 106 of 165 seats in the outgoing national assembly. 'This is the first time Pastef has decided to run alone, without a coalition. It appears that they are testing their strength and influence,' said analyst Seck, cautioning that the party had also recruited one-time allies of Sall in an effort to shore up support. The race also includes two smaller opposition coalitions represented by former Prime Minister Amadou Ba and mayor of the capital Dakar Barthelemy Dias. 'I wish all Senegalese and all political actors a peaceful and dignified electoral campaign, and I guarantee that ... the best will win,' Faye said on national TV on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-president-fights-for-mandate-in-parliamentary-race-/7844509.html	2024-10-30T04:04:21-07:00	
China stimulus should go hand in hand with reforms, ex central bank adviser says	BEIJING — China's stimulus efforts could come with a cost and they must be carried out alongside reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth, Liu Shijin, a former central bank adviser, said in remarks published Wednesday. 'Stimulus could come with a cost and we should combine stimulus with reforms,' Chinese media outlet Yicai quoted Liu as saying at a forum on Tuesday. Liu said funds should be used for enhancing areas that are critical for long-term economic development. China should prioritize improving basic healthcare services for the country's 300 million internal migrant workers as it faces a significant public healthcare shortfall, Liu said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that China is considering approving next week new debt issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) to help tackle hidden local debt and fund buybacks of idle land and reduce a giant inventory of unsold flats, in coming years. Analysts expect such efforts to be a stabilizer for the economy rather than the instant growth booster that markets have craved. China is struggling to tackle a debt overhang from previous stimulus. In 2008-2009, a 4 trillion yuan ($575 billion) spending package largely shielded China's economy from the global financial crisis but saddled local governments with mountains of debt. Liu said last month that China could issue ultra-long-term treasury bonds within two years to generate at least 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) worth of stimulus to the economy, according to state media. At a key meeting in July, Chinese leaders outlined reform steps ranging from developing advanced industries to improving local government finances, but it remains unclear on how quickly such steps will be implemented. China needs to expand its middle class group from around 400 million, currently about a third of the population - to 800-900 million in the next decade by speeding up urbanization and addressing disparities in urban-rural public services, Liu said. But Liu cautioned against stimulus through 'helicopter money,' or direct cash handouts for residents, arguing this would primarily benefit wealthier residents, while low-income groups would see minimal relief given their basic needs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-stimulus-should-go-hand-in-hand-with-reforms-ex-central-bank-adviser-says-/7844487.html	2024-10-30T03:36:57-07:00	
Israel orders evacuations in eastern Lebanon	Israel’s military issued new evacuation warnings Wednesday for people in parts of eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, warning of military actions against Hezbollah targets in the area. An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson said people in Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris should leave their homes. Israeli forces have frequently followed such warnings with airstrikes as they carry out a campaign Israeli officials say is meant to push Hezbollah back from the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has used the same methods in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while U.N. officials and humanitarian organizations have criticized the evacuation orders saying civilians have little chance to prepare and often nowhere safe to go amid the war. UNRWA ban U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has written to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing his concern over new Israeli legislation that would ban the main U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees. 'The Secretary-General is writing and has dispatched a letter not too long ago, a few hours ago to the Prime Minister of Israel, outlining his concerns, the issues of international law that has been raised by this law,' spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Tuesday of the two bills adopted Monday by the Israeli Knesset. 'Obviously, if it is implemented, it is clear that it will have a devastating impact on the humanitarian situation of Palestinians in the occupied territory,' Dujarric added. He said Guterres has also written to the president of the U.N. General Assembly, which created UNRWA in December 1949. Guterres had previously criticized the two laws, set to go into effect in 90 days, which he said 'could have devastating consequences' for Palestinian refugees. Guterres also called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, said 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas' and accused Guterres of ignoring that 'indisputable fact.' Also Tuesday, Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike hit a five-story residential building in northern Gaza, killing at least 70 people. An additional 23 people were missing after the attack in Beit Lahiya. A second strike later Tuesday killed at least 18 people, the health officials said. Israel’s military said it is investigating the first strike but did not comment on the second. It did report that four of its soldiers were killed in the fighting, bringing the toll since the start of the operation to 16. The United Nations expressed deep concern about the high number of casualties, saying it could not access Beit Lahiya. The new Israeli legislation bans the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, and forbids Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Norway's prime minister said Tuesday his government will submit a resolution to the U.N. General Assembly for it to request a ruling from the International Court of Justice on whether Israel will be violating international law. 'This undermines the right of Palestinians to receive humanitarian aid and lifesaving assistance,' Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said in a statement. 'We have a collective obligation to respond to this.' At the U.N. Security Council, the 15 member states individually expressed concern about the legislation, many of them referring to UNRWA as a 'lifeline' for Palestinians in the occupied territories and acknowledging it is the 'backbone' of the U.N. aid operation in Gaza. The U.S. envoy urged U.N. chief Guterres to create a mechanism to review and address allegations that UNRWA personnel have ties to Hamas. 'At the same time, we know that right now, there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza,' Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. 'Therefore, we have concerns about this legislation being implemented.' UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Monday that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees,' he wrote on social media platform X. Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. The legislation comes at a time when the World Food Program warns that famine threatens parts of Gaza, health care lies in shambles, and humanitarians say they face numerous obstacles in getting aid to the most needy, including Israeli denials and obstruction and Gazans looting convoys. The U.N. said Tuesday that 80% of Gazans – about 1.7 million people – have not received their October food rations. On October 15, the Biden administration gave Israel 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face consequences under U.S. law that could include curtailing military financing. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield reiterated Washington's concerns about the humanitarian situation Tuesday at the Security Council. 'That the United States rejects any Israeli efforts to starve Palestinians in Jabalya, or anywhere else,' she said referring to the besieged Palestinian camp in northern Gaza. 'And that Israel's words must be matched by action on the ground. Right now, that is not happening. This must change immediately.' The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people. Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

KDP wins Iraqi Kurdish parliamentary election	BAGHDAD — The ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) came first in a parliamentary election in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, winning 39 seats, the election commission said on Wednesday, positioning it to lead the next regional government. The KDP's historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was second with 23 seats, the commission told a news conference. It said turnout among registered voters was reported at 72%. The Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament has 100 seats with five reserved for minority groups. With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK, which have been sharing power since 1992, are likely to continue governing together, but the results suggest that Masoud Barzani's KDP will take a dominant position. Originally planned for 2022, the elections were repeatedly delayed by disputes between the KDP and PUK. Unresolved disagreements between the two major political parties are expected to complicate the formation of a new government, analysts and regional officials expect. The largest Kurdish opposition party, New Generation, was a distant third with 15 seats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kdp-wins-iraqi-kurdish-parliamentary-election/7844453.html	2024-10-30T02:24:45-07:00	
Journalist shot dead in western Mexico	Morelia, Mexico — A journalist was shot dead Tuesday night in western Mexico, a local prosecutor's office said, in a part of the country hit hard by organized crime. Mauricio Cruz Solis, a host on local radio station La Poderosa Uruapan, who also published news on the Minuto x Minuto outlet, was killed in the city of Uruapan. One other person was wounded in the attack, the prosecutor's office said. The radio station where Cruz Solis worked mourned his killing in a statement published on social media. 'Mauricio was more than a colleague, he was an unconditional friend, a source of inspiration and a tireless voice in the service of our community,' the station said. Wracked by violence related to drug trafficking, Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, news advocacy groups say. Reporters Without Borders says more than 150 newspeople have been killed in Mexico since 1994. Cruz Solis's murder is the first killing of a journalist under the government of Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office on October 1, although there have been other attacks on media this month. On October 18, gunmen shot at the front of the El Debate newspaper's office in Culiacan, the state capital of cartel stronghold Sinaloa, which has been shaken by weeks of gang infighting. A day later, a delivery worker with the outlet was abducted by presumed criminal groups and there has been no news about his whereabouts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalist-shot-dead-in-western-mexico/7844436.html	2024-10-30T01:25:54-07:00	
Bodies found as torrential rains slam Spain	MADRID — Several bodies have been recovered by emergency service workers in Spain's eastern region of Valencia after torrential rains triggered flash floods, the head of the regional government said Wednesday. 'We can confirm that some bodies have already been found,' Carlos Mazon told reporters, without saying how many. Authorities could not give further details until relatives had been informed, he added. Heavy rain lashed much of eastern and southern Spain on Tuesday, flooding streets with muddy water and disrupting rail and air travel. Images shot by residents with smartphones and broadcast on Spanish TV showed raging waters washing away cars and flooding buildings. In some areas, more than a month's rain fell in a single day, Spanish media reported. 'We are facing an unprecedented situation, which nobody remembers,' Mazon said. Officials said on Tuesday that at least seven people were missing — a truck driver in the Valencia region and six people in the town of Letur in the eastern province of Albacete. Emergency services workers backed by drones would work through the night to look for the missing in Letur, the central government's representative in Castilla-La Mancha, Milagros Tolon, told Spanish public television station TVE. 'The priority is to find these people,' she added. Crisis committee Spain central government set up a crisis committee which met for the first time late Tuesday to oversee the response to the storm. 'I am closely following with concern the reports on missing persons and the damage caused by the storm in recent hours,' Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X, urging people to follow the advice of the authorities. The government has deployed the UME, a military unit specialized in rescue operations, to Valencia to help local emergency services. Valencia city hall said all school classes and sports events were suspended on Wednesday, and parks would remain closed. Twelve flights that were due to land at Valencia airport were diverted to other cities in Spain due to the heavy rain and strong winds, Spanish airport operator Aena said. Another 10 flights that were due to depart or arrive at the airport were canceled. National rail infrastructure operator ADIF said it had suspended all rail services in the Valencia region 'until the situation returns to normal for the safety of passengers.' High-speed trains between Madrid and the city of Valencia will be suspended until 'at least' 10 am on Wednesday, it added. A high-speed train with 276 passengers derailed in the southern region of Andalusia, although no one was injured, the regional government said in a statement. Emergency services used helicopters to lift people from homes and cars in Alora in Andalusia after a river overflowed. State weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in the Valencia region and the second-highest level of alert in parts of Andalusia. Several roads were cut in both regions due to flooding. Meteorologists said the storm was caused by cold air moving over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, which produced intense rain clouds. The rains are expected to continue until at least Thursday. Scientists warn that extreme weather such as heatwaves and storms is becoming more intense as a result of climate change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bodies-found-as-torrential-rains-slam-spain/7844434.html	2024-10-30T01:19:27-07:00	
Botswana votes with ruling party seeking to extend six decades of power	Gaborone, Botswana — Southern Africa's diamond-rich nation of Botswana voted in general elections Wednesday with the ruling party seeking to extend its nearly six-decade rule and hand a second term to President Mokgweetsi Masisi. Polls opened at 6:30 a.m. for more than a million people registered to vote, with four presidential candidates in the race to head the region's oldest democracy, installed on independence from Britain in 1966 when the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) took office. 'It is my time to voice my opinion. I can't wait,' said Lone Kobe, 38, who had been queueing since 3:15 a.m. at a school in Gaborone hosting a polling station. 'I would like to experience a new Botswana. We are seeing a percentage of the population enjoying the benefits. We are just the spectators, like we are watching a movie,' said the self-employed woman, a light blanket around her shoulders. 'We want to see true democracy, transparency and a free and fair election,' said Muthisi Kemo, a 56-year-old unemployed man who arrived three hours before the polling station opened. There were irregularities in the functioning of the Independent Electoral Authority (IEC) in favor of the ruling party, he said, echoing opposition claims in the lead-up to the polls. 'It's an open secret.' Opposition groups have been critical of the IEC including for failing to share a digital version of the voters roll and a shortage of ballot papers in early voting for public officers. An unemployment rate that has reached 27% amid a weakening economy has been one of the key concerns of voters ahead of the elections, alongside claims of government corruption and mismanagement. But the ruling party points to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, with weakened demand for diamonds also chipping away at revenues. An energetic Masisi, 63, held a final campaign rally with about 400 cheering supporters in the capital late Tuesday, saying that he wanted to use his second term 'to polish' what he started in his first five years. Queen Mosiane, 34, said at the rally she was loyal to the party because its government had supported her when she became an orphan, including with education and healthcare covered by the state. 'We live peacefully in this country because of BDP,' she said. 'It's not time to change because we don't know what are we inviting.' 'The opportunities that we find, and our kids are going to find in the future, are because of the BDP,' said civil servant Refile Kutlwano, 34, at the same rally. 'The opposition is not ready to rule.' Fractured opposition Masisi was elected in 2019 with around 52% of the vote. While the party is not expected to fare much better this time, the opposition is fractured. The main opposition alliance is the left-leaning Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), led by youthful human rights lawyer, Duma Boko, 54. It lost two key members in the run-up to voting day with the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and Botswana Congress Party (BCP) quitting and each fielding their own presidential candidates. It was a blow to voters like Ookeditse Letshwenyo, 23, who saw the UDC offering opportunities to young people struggling to find work. 'Since our independence we've been ruled by the same people, with the same mindset, with the same goals,' said Letshwenyo, who has launched an IT start-up. 'You can't win against the BDP while you are divided,' he said. While the surprise return six weeks ago from three years of self-exile of the previous president Ian Khama to campaign against Masisi added some energy to the opposition, analysts said his influence was limited to a few districts. With 61 seats up for grabs in parliament, Botswana's first-past-the-post system means that the first party to take 31 seats will be declared the winner and install its candidate as president. Counting will start in the hours after polling stations close at 7 p.m. Wednesday with results due late Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-votes-with-ruling-party-seeking-to-extend-six-decades-of-power/7844430.html	2024-10-30T01:10:37-07:00	
In Georgia, some voters balanced EU hopes with the fear of war with Russia	TBILISI, Georgia — For some Georgians who supported the ruling Georgian Dream party in Saturday's disputed parliamentary election, the aspiration to go West toward the European Union had to be balanced by the brutal reality of the need to keep the peace with Russia. The opposition and foreign observers had cast the election as a watershed moment that would decide if Georgia moves closer to Europe or leans back towards Russia amid the war in Ukraine. The ruling party, which is seen as loyal to its billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, says it wants to one day join the EU but that it must also avoid confrontation with President Vladimir Putin's Russia that could leave the South Caucasus republic devastated like Ukraine. 'We've had peace these 12 years in Georgia,' said Sergo, a resident of the capital Tbilisi who has voted for Georgian Dream in every election since the party rose to power in 2012. Georgian Dream clinched 54% of the vote on Saturday, the electoral commission said, while opposition parties and the president claimed the election had been stolen and the West called for investigations into reports of voting irregularities. Observer groups, including the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said alleged violations, including ballot-stuffing, bribery, voter intimidation and violence, could have affected the election's outcome. The EU and the United States said there was not a level playing field but stopped short of saying the result was stolen by Georgian Dream. Russia accused the West of meddling. Beyond the rhetoric, though, the result poses a challenge to Tbilisi's ambitions to join the European Union, which polls show the overwhelming majority of Georgians support. Brussels has effectively frozen Georgia's EU accession application over concerns of democratic backsliding under Georgian Dream and what it casts is its pro-Russian rhetoric. Georgian Dream backers say that while they want to join Europe, they don't want to sacrifice Georgia's traditional values of family and church. EU aspirations? For them, Georgian Dream's party slogan, 'Only with peace, dignity, and prosperity to Europe,' appeals. Official results, which the opposition says are fraudulent, showed the party securing huge margins of up to 90% in rural areas, even as it underperformed in Tbilisi and other cities. Ghia Abashidze, a political analyst close to Georgian Dream, attributed the party's showing to its emphasis on keeping the peace and preserving traditional values. The Georgian parliament passed a law this year curbing LGBT rights and Pride events have been attacked by violent mobs in years past. The topic remains sensitive in conservative Georgia, which is devoutly Orthodox Christian. Abashidze said that Georgian Dream was still committed to EU integration, but found more to like in some of the bloc's Eastern European members such as Hungary, whose premier Viktor Orban flew to Tbilisi on Monday and hailed the election as free. He said Orban's Hungary, which has also been accused of democratic backsliding, shared the Georgian ruling party's core values of 'family, traditions, statehood, sovereignty, peace.' In Isani, a working-class Tbilisi neighborhood and one of the few in the capital where Georgian Dream received more votes than the four main opposition parties combined, Sergo, who did not want to give his last name, echoed the sentiment. 'We want to go to the European Union with our customs, our traditions, our mentality,' the 56-year-old said, passing freshly-baked bread to customers from his shop window. He said he believed LGBT people should receive medical treatment and go to church to become 'normal people.' Russia or EU? By contrast, opposition supporters say the ruling party's positions on foreign policy and social issues are incompatible with Europe's, and keeping the peace with Russia depends on Georgia aligning with the West. At a thousands-strong protest against the election results on Monday, Salome Gasviani said the opposition was fighting to preserve Georgia's freedom and independence. 'We're here to say out loud that Georgia is a very European country and our future is in the EU, in the West,' she said. Russia, which ruled Georgia for about 200 years, won a brief war against the country in 2008, and memories of Russian tanks rolling towards Tbilisi are still fresh for many. During the campaign, Georgian Dream played on fears of war, with posters showing devastated Ukrainian cities beside picturesque Georgian ones to illustrate the threat. 'The main thing is that we don't have a war,' 69-year-old Otar Shaverdashvili, another Isani resident, said before the vote. 'I remember the last war very well. No one wants another one.' Kornely Kakachia, head of Georgian Institute of Politics think tank, said the opposition had struggled to allay fears that a change of government could risk Georgia being sucked into the Ukraine war. 'If someone asks you to choose between war and the European Union and you have this kind of choice, then of course people will choose the status quo,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-georgia-some-voters-balanced-eu-hopes-with-the-fear-of-war-with-russia/7844417.html	2024-10-30T00:21:48-07:00	
Jailed Malaysian ex-PM Najib to take the stand in corruption case	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — A Malaysian court ruled on Wednesday jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak will have to defend himself against more abuse of power and money laundering charges in another trial over the multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB. Najib faces four charges of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering for allegedly receiving $526 million from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Najib faces up to 20 years in prison and fines up to five times the amount of funds involved in the offence. Najib, 71, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022 after being found guilty of graft in a separate 1MDB-linked case. The sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's king, with Najib set to be released in August 2028. Malaysian and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB, a state fund founded by Najib in 2009 while he was premier. The Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled on Wednesday that prosecutors had established a case against Najib on 25 charges. Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said the charges filed against Najib were valid and correct in law and found all prosecution witnesses to be credible. Prosecutors had called on 50 witnesses to give evidence, including former central bank governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, media reported. Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, who leads Najib's defense team, said the ex-premier was 'extremely disappointed' by the ruling but was prepared to take the stand in his own defense. 'My client wants to be cross-examined because he has nothing to fear,' Muhammad Shafee told reporters after the court ruling. The defense plans to call on 11 witnesses, he said, adding that the trial will resume on Dec. 2. Najib, who was voted out in 2018 after nine years in power, issued a rare apology last week for his role in mishandling the 1MDB scandal. Najib maintains he had no knowledge of any illegal transfers from the state fund, saying he was misled by others and believed that monies transferred into his personal bank accounts were political donations from the Saudi royal family. Investigators say more than $1 billion of 1MDB funds made its way into Najib's personal accounts, in a globe-spanning scheme that former U.S. attorney-general Jeff Sessions has described as 'kleptocracy at its worst.' Najib's apology came just days after Malaysia said it would introduce a law allowing house arrest for some offences. Najib has been pushing to serve the remainder of his jail sentence at home, and is seeking a court ruling to compel the government to confirm the existence of a royal order that he said accompanied the pardons board's decision and recommended house arrest for him. The government later denied the proposed law was targeted towards Najib or to help other politicians accused of corruption to escape jail.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-malaysian-ex-pm-najib-to-take-the-stand-in-corruption-case/7844414.html	2024-10-30T00:13:25-07:00	
US forest managers finalize land exchange with Native American tribe in Arizona	CAMP VERDE, Ariz. — U.S. forest managers have finalized a land exchange with the Yavapai-Apache Nation that has been decades in the making and will significantly expand the size of the tribe's reservation in Arizona's Verde Valley, tribal leaders announced Tuesday. As part of the arrangement, six parcels of private land acquired over the years by the tribe will be traded to the U.S. Forest Service in exchange for the tribe gaining ownership of 12.95 square kilometers of national forest land that is part of the tribe’s ancestral homelands. The tribe will host a signing ceremony next week to celebrate the exchange, which was first proposed in 1996. 'This is a critical step in our history and vital to the nation’s cultural and economic recovery and future prosperity,' Yavapai-Apache Chairwoman Tanya Lewis said in a post on the tribe's website. Prescott National Forest Supervisor Sarah Clawson said in a statement that there had been many delays and changes to the proposal over the years, but the tribe and the Forest Service never lost sight of developing an agreement that would benefit both public and tribal lands. The federal government has made strides over recent years to protect more lands held sacred by Native American tribes, to develop more arrangements for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into management of public lands and to streamline regulations for putting land into trust for tribes. The Yavapai-Apache Nation is made up of two distinct groups of people — the Wipuhk’a’bah and the Dil’zhe’e. Their homelands spanned more than 41,440 square kilometers of what is now central Arizona. After the discovery of gold in the 1860s near Prescott, the federal government carved out only a fraction to establish a reservation. The inhabitants eventually were forced from the land, and it wasn't until the early 1900s that they were able to resettle a tiny portion of the area. In the Verde Valley, the Yavapai-Apache Nation's reservation lands are currently comprised of less than 7.77 square kilometers near Camp Verde. The small land base hasn't been enough to develop economic opportunities or to meet housing needs, Lewis said, pointing to dozens of families who are on a waiting list for new homes. Lewis said that in acknowledgment of the past removal of the Yavapai-Apache people from their homelands, the preamble to the tribal constitution recognizes that land acquisition is among the Yavapai-Apache Nation's responsibilities. Aside from growing the reservation, the exchange will bolster efforts by federal land managers to protect the headwaters of the Verde River and ensure the historic Yavapai Ranch is not sold for development. The agreement also will improve recreational access to portions of four national forests in Arizona.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-forest-managers-finalize-land-exchange-with-native-american-tribe-in-arizona-/7844408.html	2024-10-29T23:44:03-07:00	
China launches new crew to its space station as it seeks to expand exploration	JIUQUAN, China — China declared a 'complete success' after it launched a new three-person crew to its orbiting space station early Wednesday as the country seeks to expand its exploration of outer space with missions to the moon and beyond. The Shenzhou-19 spaceship carrying the trio blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at 4:27 a.m. local time atop a Long March-2F rocket, the backbone of China’s crewed space missions. 'The crew condition is good and the launch has been successful,' the state broadcaster China Central Television announced. China built its own space station after being excluded from the International Space Station, mainly because of U.S. concerns over the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party’s military arm’s overall control over the space program. China’s moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. and others, including Japan and India. The team of two men and one woman will replace the astronauts who have lived on the Tiangong space station for the last six months. They are expected to stay until April or May of next year. The new mission commander, Cai Xuzhe, went to space in the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022, while the other two, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze, are first-time space travelers, born in the 1990s. Song was an air force pilot and Wang an engineer with the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. Wang will be the crew’s payload specialist and the third Chinese woman aboard a crewed mission. Besides putting a space station into orbit, the Chinese space agency has landed an explorer on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so. It also plans to build a research station on the moon and has already transferred rock and soil samples from the little-explored far side of the moon in a global first. The U.S. still leads in space exploration and plans to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year. The new crew will perform spacewalks and install new equipment to protect the station from space debris, some of which was created by China. According to NASA, large pieces of debris have been created by 'satellite explosions and collisions.' China’s firing of a rocket to destroy a redundant weather satellite in 2007 and the 'accidental collision of American and Russian communications satellites in 2009 greatly increased the amount of large debris in orbit,' it said. China’s space authorities say they have measures in place in case their astronauts have to return to Earth earlier. China launched its first crewed mission in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The space program is a source of enormous national pride and a hallmark of China’s technological advances over the past two decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-launches-new-crew-to-its-space-station-as-it-seeks-to-expand-exploration/7844404.html	2024-10-29T23:30:29-07:00	
Russian drones target Kyiv	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Wednesday a Russian drone attack left at least nine people injured. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram an 11-year-old girl was among those hurt when debris from a downed drone hit an apartment building. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said air defenses destroyed Russian drones that attacked the city from multiple directions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 23 Ukrainian drones deployed in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Rostov, Kursk, Smolensk, Oryol, Bryansk and Belgorod regions, the ministry said. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram there was damage to electrical lines, while officials in Kursk reported a fire at an administrative building. North Korea The Pentagon said Tuesday a 'small number' of North Korean troops have deployed to Russia’s Kursk region, where they are likely to be used in combat against Ukrainian troops. '[There are] indications that there's already a small number that are actually in the Kursk Oblast, with a couple thousand more that are either almost there or due to arrive imminently,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters. 'We remain concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Kursk,' he added. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Defense said that North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to train in Russia, more than tripling the previous estimate, and warned that those forces would likely augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks. The Pentagon has 'no information' to corroborate reports that North Korean troops are also inside Ukraine, according to Ryder. Asked by VOA whether Ukraine should strike back against North Korean forces, President Joe Biden replied, 'If they cross into Ukraine, yes.' South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday that military cooperation between North Korea and Russia 'poses a significant security threat to the international community.' The comments at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul followed Yoon saying Monday that the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine could happen 'more quickly than anticipated,' according to South Korean intelligence assessments. NATO on Monday had confirmed that 3,000 North Korean troops had been sent to Russia with some deployed to Russia’s Kursk region. Ukrainian troops invaded the border region in a surprise attack in August and still hold territory there. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of 'growing desperation' on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rutte added that more than 600,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Pentagon did not provide further details on the type of troops or equipment that North Korea had sent with them. When pressed by VOA Monday on what capabilities these troops could bring, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said, 'It’s additional bodies on the battlefield.' 'If we see DPRK troops moving in and towards the front lines, they are co-belligerents in the war,' she warned. Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance since Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin initially dismissed reports about a North Korean troop deployment as 'fake news,' but Putin last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia, adding that it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact that he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. At odds with Putin’s comments, a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York last week characterized the reports of Pyongyang’s deployment of troops in Russia as 'groundless rumors.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will host his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Hyun, on Wednesday at the Pentagon, where the two are expected to discuss the North Korean troops who are now in Russia. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drones-target-kyiv/7844400.html	2024-10-29T23:15:08-07:00	
US economy is believed to have grown at a solid pace again last quarter	WASHINGTON — Powered by consumer spending, the U.S. economy likely kept expanding at a healthy pace from July through September despite the pressure of still-high interest rates. The Commerce Department is expected to report Wednesday that the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — grew at a 2.6% annual pace last quarter, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would be down from a 3% annual rate in the April-June period. But it would still amount to a solid pace as Americans ponder the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. Wednesday's report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy, the world's biggest, has shown surprising resilience in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. The policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. Inflation, which reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, has tumbled to 2.4%, barely above the Fed’s 2% target. But average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump’s policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-economy-is-believed-to-have-grown-at-a-solid-pace-again-last-quarter/7844396.html	2024-10-29T22:58:26-07:00	
No nuclear risk from fire at submarine yard in northwest England, police say	A significant fire remains ongoing at BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England, that builds Britain's new generation of nuclear submarines, but there was no nuclear risk from the incident, police said on Wednesday. UK's Cumbria police said in a statement that two people had been taken to a hospital after suffering from suspected smoke inhalation and that there were no other casualties. The police said that everyone else had been evacuated from the Devonshire Dock Hall facility and accounted for. BAE's site in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, manufactures Royal Navy's Astute and Dreadnought submarines, according to BAE's website. The incident was reported at 12:44 am local time, police said. BAE did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Police have advised residents nearby to remain indoors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-nuclear-risk-from-fire-at-submarine-yard-in-northwest-england-police-say/7844391.html	2024-10-29T22:38:48-07:00	
Indonesia arrests former trade minister in sugar import graft case	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian authorities investigating graft have arrested a former trade minister turned government critic on suspicion of improperly granting a sugar import permit in 2015 that led to losses of $25 million. Thomas Trikasih Lembong was named a suspect and arrested late on Tuesday by prosecutors from the attorney general's office, accused of giving the permit to a private company at a time when Indonesia had a surplus of sugar, the office said. 'At that time, Indonesia did not need to import sugar but (Lembong) granted a permit to import 105,000 metric tons of raw crystal sugar,' prosecutor Abdul Qohar told a press conference. There was no consultation with other state bodies or a recommendation from the industry ministry, he said, adding that the decision had led to losses of $25.42 million. Qohar did not say what Lembong is accused of having received in return for the permit to the company, which authorities identified only by its initials, PT AP. The attorney general's office denied that its investigation had a political motive. 'I surrender everything to God Almighty,' media reported Lembong, handcuffed and wearing a pink detainee vest, as saying after the press conference. Reuters could not reach Lembong or his lawyer to seek comment. A former investment banker, Lembong was Indonesia's trade minister between 2015 and 2016 and a close aide of former president Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, for whom he often wrote international speeches. But after leaving office in 2019, he became one of the staunchest critics of Jokowi's government. Lembong was a campaign manager in February's presidential election for Anies Baswedan, who ran against the winner, defense minister Prabowo Subianto, widely seen as Jokowi's preferred successor, who took office on Oct. 20 Indonesia's sugar output in 2015 was 2.49 million metric tons, while consumption was 2.12 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-arrests-former-trade-minister-in-sugar-import-graft-case/7844386.html	2024-10-29T22:29:21-07:00

Taiwan expects super typhoon to make landfall on Thursday	taipei/taiwan — Taiwan expects Super Typhoon Kong-rey to make landfall on Thursday along the sparsely populated east coast, issuing a warning on Wednesday ahead of the powerful storm which will bring heavy rain and strong winds across a swath of the island. Packing gusts of nearly 300 kph, the storm has strengthened into a super typhoon and is expected to further intensify before hitting land in Taitung county, according to U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm is then forecast to cross Taiwan's south, enter the Taiwan Strait and head towards China, Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said, which labeled the storm as a 'strong typhoon,' the most powerful storm level for Taiwan. Up to 1.2 meters of rainfall is expected in mountainous eastern Taiwan and destructive winds are likely to hit coastal areas on Thursday, according to the administration. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te urged people to stay away from the mountains and coast. 'I would like to urge my friends in the eastern, southern and northern parts of the country to be on alert,' he wrote on his Facebook page. Taiwan's defense ministry said it had put about 36,000 troops on standby across the island. Central Weather Administration forecaster Stan Chang said it was relatively rare for a strong typhoon to directly hit Taiwan this late in the year, pointing to the still favorable environment for typhoons, including warmer sea temperatures in the Pacific and later-than-normal cold fronts from the north. 'We must urge people to make preparations. It's a strong typhoon with a large size,' Chang added. Heavy rain is also expected in the north around the capital Taipei throughout the day on Thursday, the administration said. Subtropical Taiwan is frequently hit by typhoons. The last one, Typhoon Krathon, killed four people earlier this month as it passed through the south of the island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-expects-super-typhoon-to-make-landfall-on-thursday/7844356.html	2024-10-29T21:12:42-07:00	
Australia to ramp up missile production as Indo-Pacific enters new missile age	SYDNEY — Australia said it was boosting its missile defense capability amid 'significant concerns' about China's test of an ICBM in the South Pacific, and will bolster weapons stockpiles and exports to security partners as the region enters a new 'missile age.' Minister for Defense Industry Pat Conroy said in a speech on Wednesday that Australia was increasing its missile defense and long-range strike capability, and would cooperate with security partners the United States, Japan and South Korea, to contribute to regional stability. 'Why do we need more missiles? Strategic competition between the United States and China is a primary feature of Australia's security environment,' he told the National Press Club in Canberra. China test-fired an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in September that traveled over 11,000 km to land in the Pacific Ocean to Australia's northeast. Conroy said the Indo Pacific was on the cusp of a new missile age, where missiles are also 'tools of coercion.' 'We expressed significant concern about that ballistic missile test, especially its entry into the South Pacific given the Treaty of Rarotonga that says the Pacific should be a nuclear weapons free zone,' he told reporters in response to a question. Australia was deploying SM-6 missiles on its navy destroyer fleet to provide ballistic missile defense, he added. Earlier this month, Australia announced a $4.75 billion deal with the United States to acquire SM-2 IIIC and Raytheon SM-6 long-range missiles for its navy. Australia has previously said it would spend $49 billion on missile acquisition and missile defense over the next decade, including $14 billion to fund the Australian Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise, a new domestic manufacturing capability. 'We must show potential adversaries that hostile acts against Australia would not succeed and could not be sustained if conflict were protracted,' Conroy said in the speech. Australia will spend $212 million to establish local manufacture of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), in partnership with Lockheed Martin, to produce the rapidly deployable, surface-to-surface weapons for export, from 2029. The factory will be capable of producing 4,000 GMLRS a year, or a quarter of current global production, Conroy said. France's Thales will establish Australian manufacturing of 155mm M795 artillery ammunition, used in howitzers, at an Australian government-owned munitions facility in the small Victorian city of Benalla. It will be the first dedicated forge outside of the U.S., with production starting in 2028, and the capacity to scale up to produce 100,000 rounds a year. The war in Ukraine was using 10,000 rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells a day last year, outstripping European production, he said. 'In a world marked by supply chain disruption and strategic fragility, Australia needs not only to acquire more missiles, but to make more here at home,' he said. In August, Australia said it would jointly manufacture long-range Naval Strike Missiles and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway's Kongsberg Defence in the city of Newcastle on Australia's eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway. Australia's navy will also have Tomahawk missiles, with a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles), by the end of the year, increasing the fleet's weapons range 10-fold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-to-ramp-up-missile-production-as-indo-pacific-enters-new-missile-age/7844334.html	2024-10-29T20:36:56-07:00

North Korea's troop deployment to Ukraine could test Beijing-Pyongyang ties	WASHINGTON — As Ukraine braces to face North Korean troops who are believed to be in the Russian border region of Kursk, analysts say China should be concerned about stronger pressure and responses from NATO, which sees Beijing as an enabler of Pyongyang and a supporter of Russia's war against Ukraine. South Korea's National Intelligence Agency said on Tuesday it has obtained information that North Korean troops are moving to the front lines of the war in Russia near Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Monday that North Korean military units have been deployed to Russia's western border region of Kursk. He made the remark after a South Korean delegation briefed NATO, Australia, Japan and New Zealand on North Korea's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine. Rutte continued that North Korea's troop dispatch, in addition to shipments of ammunition and ballistic missiles, represents 'a dangerous expansion of Russia's war' that threatens both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. In return for North Korean troops and weapons, Moscow is providing Pyongyang with 'military technology and other support to circumvent international sanctions,' Rutte added. The U.S. estimates that North Korea sent about 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia. North Korea said on Friday that 'if there is such a thing' as North Korea troops in Russia, 'it will be an act conforming with the regulation of international law.' Growing signs of strain Analysts say North Korea's commitment of troops to help Russia would further strain its relations with China, which undoubtedly will dislike the development that would lead to the strengthening of NATO's ties with South Korea. 'China should be concerned about NATO paying more attention to North Korea, especially since many NATO member countries see Beijing as Pyongyang's enabler,' Ramon Pacheco Pardo, who was part of European Union delegations to previous talks with North Korea, South Korea, China and Japan, told VOA on Friday. North Korea's troop dispatch will lead NATO to focus further on Pyongyang's cyber activities and nuclear and missile programs and proliferation, and this can have 'a knock-on effect on China,' continued Pacheco Pardo, a professor of international relations at King's College London. 'China can't afford to sever ties with North Korea, due to its own security interests. So, Beijing has to endure North Korea siding with Russia and being labeled as part of an axis of authoritarian revisionist states, even if it doesn't like this label,' he added. Earlier in October, NATO held talks with its Asian partners to enhance the security link between Europe and the Indo-Pacific, expressing concern over countries such as China and North Korea that can become 'security spoilers' in their 'backyard.' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, told VOA on Friday that Beijing is uneasy about Moscow's growing influence in the region through military cooperation with Pyongyang. He said China tolerated North Korea's sending munitions to Russia because it viewed that as having 'a limited time frame,' but after North Korea's troop deployment, Beijing is concerned about their long-term ties contributing to Moscow's growth as a dominant power in East Asia, which threatens Beijing's view of itself as playing that role. Responding to VOA's inquiry on the development of North Korea-Russia military cooperation, the Chinese Embassy in Washington on Tuesday sent a statement saying Beijing hopes 'all parties will promote the de-escalation of the situation and strive for a political settlement.' Keeping the status quo Chinese President Xi Jinping, while attending the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, on October 23, said there is a need to stop 'adding fuel to the fire' in the Ukraine crisis without mentioning specific countries. Beijing, seeing North Korea as a buffer zone between its mainland and U.S. forces stationed in South Korea, has long been Pyongyang's main ally as the biggest trading partner. To prevent it from becoming unstable, China has maintained the economic lifeline of the regime that is heavily sanctioned and closed off from the global economy. But trouble in their bilateral ties seemed to begin when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited Russia last year and were exacerbated when Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defense treaty in Pyongyang this summer. The latest development in the deepening military relations between Pyongyang and Moscow could 'complicate Beijing's own plans to have it both ways in the Russia-Ukraine war,' according to Roy Kamphausen, a senior fellow for Chinese security at the National Bureau of Asian Research. Kamphausen said on Friday that China wants to 'support Russia enough' so Moscow 'can win slowly' but 'avoid too much blowback, especially economic sanctions on China itself.' He added, 'Escalation in the current conflict which comes from Asia itself might have the negative impact of putting more pressure on Beijing itself, just what it wants to avoid.' The U.S. earlier this month sanctioned China-based companies for collaborating with Russia to produce drones for use against Ukraine. Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA on Friday that 'Beijing would see little benefit to establish a more formal trilateral alliance because being too closely linked to Russian and North Korean provocative behavior could trigger secondary sanctions against China.' China in 2023 was the largest trading partner for EU imports and third largest for EU exports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-troop-deployment-to-ukraine-could-test-beijing-pyongyang-ties/7844318.html	2024-10-29T19:25:06-07:00	
Prosecutor tells jury of 9/11-style plot thwarted in the Philippines	NEW YORK — A Kenyan man who plotted a 9/11-style attack on a U.S. building was training as a commercial pilot in the Philippines when his plans were interrupted, a federal prosecutor told a New York jury Tuesday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Bodansky told a federal jury in Manhattan that Cholo Abdi Abdullah plotted an attack for four years that he hoped to carry out on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab. He said Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training when he was arrested in July 2019 in the Philippines on local charges. He was transferred in December 2020 to U.S. law enforcement authorities, who charged him with terrorism-related crimes. Abdullah underwent training in explosives and how to operate in secret and avoid detection before moving to the Philippines in 2017 to begin intensive training for a commercial pilot's license, the prosecutor said. Abdullah posed as an aspiring commercial pilot even though his true intention was to locate a building in the United States where he could carry out a suicide attack from the cockpit by slamming his plane into a building, Bodansky told the jury. He said Abdullah was 'planning for four years a 9/11-style attack' only to have it thwarted with his arrest. The defendant, operating from a Nairobi hotel, used the internet to research how to breach a cockpit door and looked up a 2019 terrorist attack that killed some 21 people, Bodansky said. Among those killed in that attack was an American businessman who survived the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Prosecutors have said Abdullah also researched information 'about the tallest building in a major U.S. city' before he was caught. Abdullah, who is representing himself and once pleaded not guilty, declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate in questioning witnesses Tuesday. In court papers filed before the trial, prosecutors told the judge that they understood 'through standby counsel that the defendant maintains his position that he 'wants to merely sit passively during the trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate system.'' The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means 'the youth' in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic state in Somalia based on Shariah law. If convicted, Abdullah faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. His trial is expected to last three weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutor-tells-jury-of-9-11-style-plot-thwarted-in-the-philippines/7844307.html	2024-10-29T18:43:00-07:00	
For expats in Ukraine, election back in US hits home	The outcome of the U.S. election and the possible changes in Washington’s foreign policy are of special significance to the 3 million American expatriates eligible to vote in next week’s U.S. presidential elections. In few places is that outcome more tangible than in Ukraine, where a few thousand Americans have, for various reasons, chosen to live after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion.

In a first since 1938, Des Moines, Iowa, kids will trick-or-treat on Halloween	DES MOINES, Iowa — For the first time since 1938, children in Des Moines, Iowa, will go trick-or-treating on Halloween. Going door-to-door for candy on All Hallows' Eve has long been commonplace throughout the country. But not in Des Moines, where Iowa's capital city took a different approach more than seven decades ago in hopes of tamping down on hooliganism. Instead, Des Moines children don their costumes on Beggars' Night, typically the day before Halloween. And besides screaming, 'Trick-or-Treat,' children are expected to tell a joke before receiving a treat. This year, Beggars' Night was set for Wednesday, but because of expected heavy rain and thunderstorms, officials delayed trick-or-treating until Thursday, which to the rest of the country is the normal Halloween. 'To my knowledge, it has never been moved or canceled since it was established after Halloween in 1938,' Assistant City Manager Jen Schulte said. 'However, the safety of our residents, families and children is always our top priority and led to the change in this year's scheduled Beggars' Night.' The city began its unusual custom at the suggestion of a former city parks director as a way to reduce vandalism and promote more wholesome fun for kids. Initially, children were encouraged to sing a song, recite poetry and offer some other kind of entertainment, but over time a joke became the most common offering. Beggar's Night also has limited hours, typically running from 6 to 8 p.m. Many of Des Moines' suburbs also adopted the Beggars' Night tradition and chose to shift the celebration to Halloween this year. 'I didn't realize we were that much of an anomaly because for us, this is normal,' said Debbie Westphal Swander, who owns a costume shop in West Des Moines. 'We're going to be in sync at least for this year with the way the event is celebrated everywhere else. 'The big picture for me is, it's absolutely about the kids. That's the most important thing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-a-first-since-1938-des-moines-iowa-kids-will-trick-or-treat-on-halloween/7844271.html	2024-10-29T17:33:26-07:00	
US finalizes rule restricting investment in Chinese tech firms	The Treasury Department on Monday finalized a new rule meant to prevent U.S.-based people and companies from investing in the development of a range of advanced technologies in China, thereby preventing Beijing from accessing cutting-edge expertise and equipment. The rule, which implements an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in 2023, focuses particularly on advanced semiconductors and microelectronics and the equipment used to make them, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems. When it takes effect on January 2, the rule will prohibit certain transactions in semiconductors, microelectronics and artificial intelligence. It also establishes mandatory reporting requirements for transactions that are not banned outright. In the field of quantum computing, the rule is more far-reaching, banning all transactions 'related to the development of quantum computers or production of any critical components required to produce a quantum computer,' as well as the development of other quantum systems. Unlike the fields of AI and semiconductors, the rule does not allow for transactions that can be completed so long as they are reported to the government. The rule also announced the creation of the Office of Global Transactions within Treasury’s Office of Investment Security, which will administer the Outbound Investment Security Program. Justification and opposition 'Artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum technologies are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications like cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next generation fighter jets,' Paul Rosen, assistant secretary for investment security, said in a statement. 'This Final Rule takes targeted and concrete measures to ensure that U.S. investment is not exploited to advance the development of key technologies by those who may use them to threaten our national security,' Rosen said. Beijing has repeatedly complained about U.S. technology policy, arguing that the U.S. is dedicated to preventing China’s rise as a global power. In a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated China’s longstanding objections to U.S. efforts to withhold advanced technology from Chinese companies. 'China deplores and rejects the U.S.’s Final Rule to curb investment in China,' Lin said. 'China has protested to the U.S. and will take all measures necessary to firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.' Not just equipment The language of the rule frequently notes that it applies to transactions with 'countries of concern,' but the specific language in the text makes it plain that the targets of the rule are companies and individuals doing business in mainland China as well as the 'special administrative districts' of Hong Kong and Macao. The Final Rule’s ban on transactions is not limited to the physical transfer of finished goods and machinery in the specified fields. Explanatory documents released on Monday make it clear that several intangible benefits are also covered. Countries of concern 'are exploiting or have the ability to exploit certain United States outbound investments, including certain intangible benefits that often accompany United States investments and that help companies succeed,' an informational statement accompanying the rule said. 'These intangible benefits include enhanced standing and prominence, managerial assistance, investment and talent networks, market access, and enhanced access to additional financing.' Signaling to US companies The onus will be on U.S. companies to comply with the new rule, Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, told VOA. 'This is the U.S. government signaling to U.S. entities and investors that they need to think twice about making investments on the prohibited transaction side of the equation that would advance China's capabilities in these areas,' Ezell said. He added that the impact of the rule on investment in Chinese technology companies would have effects far beyond any reduction in funding. 'It's not just the dollars,' he said. 'A key target here is getting at the intangible benefits that come with those investments, such as managerial capability, talent networks.' He described that loss as 'very significant.' Closing loopholes In an email exchange with VOA, Daniel Gonzales, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation, explained that the purpose of the rule was, in part, to prevent U.S. investment firms from supporting Chinese firms in the development of certain kinds of technology. 'These rules were put in place after many episodes where U.S. [venture capital] companies helped to transfer or nurture advanced technologies that have relevant military capabilities,' Gonzales wrote. 'One particular case was that of TikTok and its AI algorithms, which were developed with the help of Sequoia Capital of California.' Sequoia did not break any laws in assisting TikTok, Gonzales said. But 'it has since become known to U.S. authorities that TikTok does possess an AI algorithm that has a variety of applications, some of which have military implications. This new rule is intended to close this loophole.' Gonzales said the U.S. government’s concern with quantum computing is also born of worries about Chinese offensive capabilities. 'Chinese researchers are working on developing quantum computer algorithms that can break encryption codes used by the U.S. government and the U.S. financial sector to protect private and confidential information,' he wrote. 'China has several startup companies working to develop more powerful quantum computers. This new rule is intended to prevent the leakage of U.S. quantum technology to China through U.S. VCs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finalizes-rule-restricting-investment-in-chinese-tech-firms/7844263.html	2024-10-29T17:10:20-07:00

US court declines RFK Jr's request to order 2 states to drop him from ballot	The U.S. Supreme Court denied a bid Tuesday by former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan for the Nov. 5 election. Kennedy has said he wants voters who would have backed him to cast ballots for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. The court declined Kennedy's emergency requests to order the Wisconsin Elections Commission and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to take him off the ballot in those states. Michigan and Wisconsin are among a handful of closely contested states expected to decide the outcome of the race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision concerning the Michigan ballot only. No other justice publicly dissented. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist known by his initials RFK Jr., has sought the Supreme Court's intervention in his attempts to stay on the ballot in some states while dropping off others. In September, the Supreme Court rejected his bid to be restored to the ballot in New York. Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed the former president's candidacy. Kennedy has urged his supporters everywhere to back Trump and has withdrawn from the ballot in a number of Republican-leaning states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-declines-to-let-rfk-jr-drop-off-ballot-in-wisconsin-michigan-/7843953.html	2024-10-29T16:37:26-07:00	
Judge dismisses Republican lawsuit targeting Pennsylvania overseas ballots	A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a Republican lawsuit seeking to force election battleground state Pennsylvania to strengthen its procedures for verifying ballots submitted by military and overseas voters. Six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking reelection on November 5 had sued Pennsylvania's top election officials on September 30. The Republicans had argued that the state was improperly exempting overseas voters from a requirement that their identity documents be verified, creating a vulnerability for fraudulent votes to be submitted. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of closely contested states that are expected to decide the outcome of the U.S. presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner dismissed the case in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, deciding that the plaintiffs had waited too long to file their complaint given that Pennsylvania's procedures had been in place for years. The suit was one of dozens around the country in which Republicans have challenged voting procedures or sought to purge voter rolls in what they call a push to ensure that people do not vote illegally. That legal blitz has been faltering. In the past three weeks, Trump allies have been dealt at least 11 court losses. Conner also said Erick Kaardal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, had not provided evidence that there had been foreign influence over Pennsylvania's overseas ballots. The judge wrote that when he pressed Kaardal for such evidence during an October 18 hearing, the lawyer 'effectively conceded that all he had was 'concerns.'' 'Plaintiffs cannot rely on phantom fears of foreign malfeasance to excuse their lack of diligence,' Conner wrote. 'We don't want votes from Iran or Russia or invalid votes counting,' Kaardal had told the hearing in Harrisburg federal court over a motion to dismiss the case filed by the Democratic National Committee and Pennsylvania's top elections official. The Election Research Institute, a conservative group whose lawyer Karen DiSalvo brought the case alongside Kaardal, said the plaintiffs were disappointed by the dismissal and were considering options for appeal. Judges in the election battleground states of Michigan and North Carolina this month also rejected lawsuits filed by the Republican National Committee seeking to block votes from some Americans living overseas. In those cases, the Republicans argued the states improperly allowed U.S. citizens living abroad who had never lived in those states to vote there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-dismisses-republican-lawsuit-targeting-pennsylvania-overseas-ballots-/7843920.html	2024-10-29T16:29:57-07:00	
Russia's refusal to return body of Ukrainian journalist slows death investigation	washington — Investigations into the death in Russian custody of Viktoria Roshchyna are being hampered by Moscow’s refusal to return the body of the 27-year-old Ukrainian journalist. Ukraine earlier this month announced that Roshchyna had died in Russian custody on September 19. She had been due to be returned as part of a prisoner release. Petro Yatsenko, from the Ukrainian Coordination Center for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, said that Roshchyna’s body was supposed to be repatriated on October 18, according to a letter that Roshchyna’s father received from Russia’s Defense Ministry. It remains unclear why her body was not included in that exchange. Roshchyna’s death is 'something that happened to a Ukrainian journalist in Russia, by Russian authorities. So all the keys to understanding what happened are in Russia’s hands. And there’s obviously very little hope that Russia will even wish to show even a little bit of the truth,' Karol Luczka told VOA. Luczka, who monitors Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna, said it is 'inexplicable and just appalling' that Russian authorities have not released the body. Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 during a reporting trip to a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine. Moscow did not acknowledge that she was detained until about eight months after her disappearance. Andriy Yusov, from Ukraine’s Military Intelligence, confirmed earlier this month that Roshchyna had been slated for a prisoner release. Some reports indicate that Roshchyna died while being transferred from a detention center in Taganrog, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, to Moscow in preparation for her return home. Russia’s Washington embassy, Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. A freelance journalist, Roshchyna contributed to Ukrainian outlets including Ukrainska Pravda. She also freelanced for the Ukrainian Service of VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Colleagues remembered her as a journalist committed to reporting on war crimes in Russia’s war against Ukraine, even in dangerous regions. In 2022, Roshchyna was briefly detained by Russian forces while reporting in Berdiansk, in occupied southeastern Ukraine. That experience didn’t deter her from continuing to report in Russian-occupied regions. When Moscow confirmed that Roshchyna was in Russian custody, it was a relief for her supporters, including Elisa Lees Munoz. The executive director of the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, said the news confirmed that Roshchyna was at least still alive and that there was hope that she would be released. 'Unfortunately, that hope vanished when we learned of her passing,' Munoz told VOA. The IWMF awarded Roshchyna its 2022 courage award. When the IWMF invited Roshchyna to the U.S. to accept the award in person, Roshchyna declined, saying she needed to stay in Ukraine to keep reporting, Munoz said. Press freedom groups are calling for Moscow to make public the circumstances of Roshchyna’s death. Figuring out how Roshchyna died will be difficult without her body, according to Arnaud Froger, the head of investigations at Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, in Paris. 'Without the body, there are only assumptions that we can make,' Froger told VOA. He added that he wouldn’t trust any Russian medical records or autopsy reports without an independent examination of the body. RSF is investigating Roshchyna’s death to figure out what happened and who was involved. With travel to Russia not possible due to security concerns, RSF is left to push Moscow to release Roshchyna’s body and search for witnesses, Froger said. United Nations experts are calling for accountability in Roshchyna’s case, as well as the release of her body. Munoz says she isn’t very hopeful about long-term accountability in Roshchyna’s case. Without an autopsy, Munoz said it will be difficult to determine whether Roshchyna was killed, or whether she died as a result of poor prison conditions. 'Regardless of whether she died of so-called ‘natural causes,’ it was obviously a result of her captivity,' Munoz said. 'I would say that she was killed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-refusal-to-return-body-of-ukrainian-journalist-slows-death-investigation-/7843951.html	2024-10-29T15:51:44-07:00	
Somalia expels Ethiopian diplomat	Somalia has declared an Ethiopian diplomat working in Mogadishu a persona non grata. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Somalia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the diplomat of engaging in 'activities incompatible with his diplomatic role.' The diplomat, Ali Mohamed Adan, who is a counselor at Ethiopia's embassy in Mogadishu, was ordered to leave Somalia within 72 hours of receiving the notice. Somalia did not specify the actions allegedly committed by Ali, but the statement said they 'constitute a breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.' VOA's Horn of Africa Service sought comments from the spokesperson for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nebiat Getachew, but did not receive any. Somalia and Ethiopia have been involved in a heated diplomatic dispute since Addis Ababa signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Somaliland, a move Somalia sees as infringement on its sovereignty. Ethiopia and Somaliland defended the MOU. If implemented, it would give Somaliland recognition from landlocked Ethiopia in return for the leasing of 20 kilometers of seafront, according to Somaliland officials. In April, Somalia expelled Ethiopian Ambassador Muktar Mohamed Ware, alleging 'internal interference' by Ethiopia. Somalia also ordered the closure of Ethiopia's consulates in Somaliland and Puntland, though they remained open. Last month, Somali Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre, speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, urged the international community to stand with Somalia in condemning Ethiopia's violations. Barre alleged that Ethiopia was attempting to 'annex parts of Somalia under the guise of securing sea access.' Taye Atske Selassie was the foreign minister at the time and rejected the Somalian prime minister's comments, insisting that Ethiopia's MOU with Somaliland is 'based on existing political dispensation in Somalia.' 'Ethiopia's name can never be associated with any one of the allegations,' said Taye, who has now become Ethiopia's ceremonial president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-expels-ethiopian-diplomat-/7843888.html	2024-10-29T14:34:18-07:00	
Companies find solutions to power EVs in energy-challenged Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — Some companies are coming up with creative ways of making electric vehicles a more realistic option in power-challenged areas of Africa. Countries in Africa have been slow adopters of battery-powered vehicles because finding reliable sources of electricity is a challenge in many places. The Center for Strategic and International Studies described Africa as 'the most energy-deficient continent in the world' and said that any progress made in electricity access in the last five years has been reversed by the pandemic and population growth. Onesmus Otieno, for one, regrets trading in his diesel-powered motor bike for an electric one. He earns his living making deliveries and ferrying passengers around Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, with his bike. The two-wheeled taxis popularly known as 'boda boda' in Swahili are commonly used in Kenya and throughout Africa. Kenyan authorities recently introduced the electric bikes to phase out diesel ones. Otieno is among the few riders who adopted them, but he said finding a place to charge his bike has been a headache. Sometimes the battery dies while he is carrying a customer, he said, while a charging station is far away. So, he has to end that trip and cancel other requests. To address the problem, Chinese company Beijing Sebo created a mobile application that allows users of EVs to request a charge through the app. Then, charging equipment is brought to the user’s location. Lin Lin, general manager for overseas business of Beijing Sebo, said because the company produces the equipment, it can control costs. 'We can deploy the product ... in any country they need, and they don’t need to build or fix charging stations,' Lin said. 'We can move to the location of the user, and we can bring electricity to electric vehicles.' Lin said the mobile charging vans use electricity generated from solid waste and can charge up to five cars at one time for about $7 per vehicle — less for a motorbike. Countries in Africa have been slow to adopt electric vehicles because there is a lack of infrastructure to support the technology, analysts say. The cost of EVs is another barrier, said clean energy expert Ajay Mathur. ''Yes, the capital cost is more,' Mathur said. 'The first cost is more, but you recover it in about six years or so. We are at the beginning of the revolution.' Electric motor bike maker Spiro offers a battery-swapping service in several countries to address the lack of EV infrastructure. But studies show that for many African countries, access to reliable and affordable electricity remains a challenge. There are frequent power cuts, outages and voltage fluctuations in several regions. Companies such as Beijing Sebo and Spiro are finding ways around the lack of power in Africa. ''We want to solve the problem of charging anxiety anywhere you are,' Lin said.

Heavy rains cause flash floods in Spain's south, east	Madrid — Torrential rains caused by a cold front moving across southeastern Spain flooded roads and towns on Tuesday, prompting authorities in the worst-hit areas to advise citizens to stay at home and avoid all non-essential travel. Spain's state weather agency AEMET declared a red alert in the eastern Valencia region and the second-highest level of alert in parts of Andalusia in the south, where a train derailed due to the heavy rainfall, although no one was injured. Footage showed firefighters rescuing trapped drivers amid heavy rain in the Valencian town of Alzira and flooded streets with stuck cars. Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Meteorologists believe the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. AEMET expected Valencia to take the brunt of the storm, with forecasts of more than 90 mm of rain in less than one hour, or 180 mm in under 12 hours. Schools, courthouses and other essential services were suspended in Carlet and some other nearby towns in the Valencia region. Local emergency services requested the help of UME, a military unit specialized in rescue operations, in the area of Utiel-Requena, where farmers' association ASAJA said the storm was causing significant damage to crops. The storm first struck Andalusia. In El Ejido, a Mediterranean city known for its sprawling greenhouses, a hailstorm broke hundreds of car windscreens, flooded the streets and damaged the mostly plastic greenhouse infrastructure. In Alora, also in Andalusia, the Guadalorce river overflowed and 14 people there had to be rescued by firefighters, authorities said. Alora topped AEMET's ranking on Tuesday with 160 mm of rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-rains-cause-flash-floods-in-spain-south-east/7843825.html	2024-10-29T13:13:54-07:00	
Workers launch strikes as Germany frets over industrial future	BERLIN — Thousands of German workers launched nationwide strikes to press for higher wages on Tuesday, compounding problems for companies worried about staying globally competitive as high costs, weak exports and foreign rivals chip away at their strengths. The strikes by unionized workers in the nearly 4-million strong electrical engineering and metal industries hit companies such as Porsche, BMW and Mercedes. Also this week, car giant Volkswagen could announce plans to shut three plants on home soil for the first time in its 87-year history, as well as mass layoffs and 10% wage cuts for workers who keep their jobs. A worsening business outlook in Europe's largest economy has piled pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's rickety coalition government, which could be on the verge of collapse ahead of federal elections next year as policy cracks widen. Scholz hosted a meeting with business leaders on Tuesday, including Volkswagen boss Oliver Blume, to discuss strategies for bolstering Germany's industrial sector. The three-hour closed-door meeting in Berlin was aimed at exploring policy measures to drive growth, protect industrial jobs, and reinforce Germany’s position as a global industrial hub, government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said in a statement. The talks mark the beginning of a broader initiative by the German government, with follow-up discussions planned for Nov. 15, Hebestreit added. In a sign of government dysfunction, his finance minister has also announced a separate summit on the same day. Germany has a long history of so-called 'warning strikes' during wage negotiations, but they come at a time of employers' deepening concerns about the future. A leading business group said a survey of companies pointed to Germany experiencing another year of economic contraction in 2024 and no prospect of growth next year. 'We are not just dealing with a cyclical, but a stubborn structural crisis in Germany,' said Martin Wansleben, managing director of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry that conducted the survey. 'We are greatly concerned about how much Germany is becoming an economic burden for Europe and can no longer fulfill its role as an economic workhorse,' he said. A separate survey by the VDA auto industry association suggested the transformation of the German car industry could lead to 186,000 job losses by 2035, of which roughly a quarter have already occurred. 'Europe — especially Germany — is losing more and more international competitiveness,' said the VDA report, which also stated that German companies paid up to three times more for electricity than their U.S. or Chinese rivals, while facing higher taxes and increasing bureaucratic burdens. Workers want share The International Monetary Fund joined those calling for reforms in Germany, suggesting the government ditch a constitutionally enshrined borrowing cap known as the debt brake so it can boost investment. While the debt brake is supported by Finance Minister Christian Lindner, he is at odds with Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who has called for a multibillion-euro fund to stimulate growth. 'The economic policy debate is where it belongs: right at the top of the agenda,' Lindner said on X. 'We have no time to lose.' The meetings with Lindner and Scholz have prompted companies and industry associations to air their gripes. The chemicals lobby VCI lamented 'poor framework conditions' and high energy costs faced by its members, and called on Scholz to make 'groundbreaking decisions' to unleash competitiveness. Reinhold von Eben-Worlee, from the association of family-run companies, compared the plight of Germany's Mittelstand firms to a marathon runner weighed down by a heavy rucksack of high taxes and social security contributions, and red tape. Tuesday's strikes were orchestrated by the powerful IG Metall union, which also staged a walkout during the night shift at Volkswagen's plant in the city of Osnabrueck, where workers worry the site may be shutting down. Approximately 71,000 workers participated in Tuesday's strike, impacting around 370 companies across Germany, according to a spokesperson for IG Metall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/workers-launch-strikes-as-germany-frets-over-industrial-future-/7843812.html	2024-10-29T12:58:44-07:00	
Thailand gambling on casinos to boost economy, but risks remain	Bangkok — Thailand is hoping that a new draft bill that aims to introduce entertainment complexes and casinos throughout the country will give its economy and tourism a much-needed boost. Experts say the prospect of building casinos brings both benefits and risks to the Southeast Asian country. Thai officials announced last week that they expect a draft of the Entertainment Complex Act will be submitted to the Cabinet later this year and deliberated in parliament in the early part of 2025. Officials are hopeful casinos will boost tourism and increase jobs for Thai citizens, contributing to economic growth. But critics say casino gambling goes against traditional Buddhist values and could feed into organized crime. Last week, Julapun Amornwiwat, deputy finance minister, said the Finance Ministry completed a public study about the prospect of opening entertainment complexes. He also said that 'the draft has recently undergone public hearings as required by the Constitution, with 82% of participants expressing support.' Building casinos has long been a goal for the government, said James Warren, a lecturer in the social science division at Mahidol University International College in Thailand. 'The idea of opening casinos has been proposed a number of times in the past, in particular during Thaksin’s [Shinawatra] stint as PM,' he told VOA via email. 'Some of the mooted benefits of opening casinos are that this would reduce corruption and the underground economy, while also creating jobs, encouraging investment and raising tax revenues,' he said. 'The most recent proposal can be seen as part of the Pheu Thai government's stated aim of bringing the underground economy overground.' Illegal, but common As it stands, most forms of gambling in Thailand are illegal. But illicit gambling dens have long been common, with authorities frequently cracking down on them. Police have busted dens in a variety of locations over the years, including zoos and football stadiums. Despite this, Thai governments over the past two decades have been eager to introduce legal casinos in the country. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the father of current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the ruling Pheu Thai party, laid out in an August speech a 14-point plan to improve the Thai economy, which included investing in entertainment complexes. 'The main purpose of the proposed casinos is to boost tourism and, in particular, lure back the Chinese tourists that were instrumental in Thailand attracting 40-million tourists in 2019,' Warren told VOA. Of the tourists who visited Thailand in 2019, 11 million were from China. So far this year – between January and September – there have been more than 5.2 million Chinese visitors to Thailand, with 8 million forecast by the end of 2024, according to the Thai government. Gary Bowerman, a tourism analyst in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, says Thailand’s casino push contributes to its wide-scale tourism effort. 'Thailand sees integrated resorts as a missing piece of its tourism jigsaw,' he told VOA. 'Singapore and Macau have proved that upscale casino resorts can help diversify the visitor mix by combining cutting-edge hotels, entertainment, dining, shopping and lifestyle elements ultimately all funded by the casinos. 'Being a much larger country, Thailand will want these resorts to diversify the tourism offerings in different destinations.' Thailand officials hope that building several casinos across the country — including in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket — will boost the kingdom's gross domestic product by at least 5%. Tourism crucial to economy That’s because tourism is vital to Thailand’s economy, which overall is performing sluggishly, with a forecast GDP growth of only 2.4% for 2024, according to the World Bank. The Thai government expects 36 million visitors by the end of the year and has an ambitious target to welcome 40 million visitors in 2025. But the prospect of visitors entering Thailand for gambling purposes has some worried that casinos could lead to an increase in criminal activity. Casinos are common in Southeast Asia, including in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines. But according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, casinos expand cyber fraud in the region, which is already rife with online scam centers that swindle billions of dollars a year from victims. And there are concerns that could happen in Thailand, too. 'Academics and senators criticized the casino proposal during the 2001-2006 Thaksin administration on the grounds that gambling contravenes Buddhist precepts,' Warren said. Other criticisms are that casinos will encourage problem gambling, debt and related crimes. On encouraging criminals to come to Thailand, I would say that this would largely depend on how well regulated the casinos are.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-gambling-on-casinos-to-boost-economy-but-risks-remain/7843800.html	2024-10-29T12:55:25-07:00	
EU slaps tariffs on Chinese EVs, risking Beijing backlash	brussels — The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3% at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe and prompted retaliation from Beijing. Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10% car import duty. The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices. It says China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100% tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe. Beijing has called the EU tariffs protectionist and damaging to EU-China relations and automotive supply chains and has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products in apparent retaliation. It has also challenged the EU's provisional measures at the World Trade Organization. European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models. The EU's stance toward Beijing has hardened in the last five years. It views China as a potential partner in some areas, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival, but EU members are not united on EV tariffs. Germany, the EU's biggest economy and major car producer, opposed tariffs in a vote earlier this month in which 10 EU members backed them, five voted against and 12 abstained. Germany's economy ministry said on Tuesday Berlin supported ongoing EU negotiations with China and hoped for a diplomatic resolution to mitigate trade tensions while protecting EU industry. 'The Federal Government stands for open markets. Because Germany in particular, as a globally interconnected economy, is dependent on this,' the spokesperson added. German carmakers have heavily criticized the EU measures, aware that possible higher Chinese import duties on large-engine gasoline vehicles would hit them hardest. The measures come as thousands of German industrial workers, including at the carmakers, strike for higher wages, with Volkswagen possibly about to announce shutting plants on home soil for the first time in its 87-year history. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the EU was headed for an 'economic cold war' with China. However, France's PFA car association has welcomed duties, adding it backed free trade as long as it was fair. The Commission has held eight rounds of technical negotiations with China to find an alternative to tariffs and said talks can continue after tariffs are imposed. The two sides are looking at possible minimum price commitments for imported cars and agreed on Friday to hold a further round, although the Commission said there were 'significant remaining gaps.' It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially. In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7% from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association, or CPCA, show.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-slaps-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-risking-beijing-backlash-/7843786.html	2024-10-29T12:42:13-07:00	
Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual violence escalate	GENEVA — The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening 'regional instability. 'The scale of this displacement and the corresponding humanitarian needs grows every day,' Amy Pope, IOM director general, told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan. 'Throughout this year, Sudan has been the world’s largest displacement crisis. Today I can share that we will release new figures this week showing the displacement number has hit 11 million. That is up 200,000 just since September,' she said, adding that an additional 3.1 million people have fled across borders as refugees. 'Nearly 30% of Sudan’s population has been displaced. ... That is actually over 14 million people who are on the move right now,' she said, noting that more than half of those displaced are women and more than a quarter are children under the age of 5. 'Unfortunately, many have been forced to flee repeatedly. They have little access to shelter; they have little access to livelihoods, and getting their basic needs met has been very, very difficult. The scale of displacement and humanitarian needs are growing every day,' she said. Since war between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, erupted 18 months ago, more than 24,000 people have been killed, the United Nations reports. The World Food Program reports 26 million people face acute hunger, and famine has broken out in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, home to half a million internally displaced people. 'The suffering is growing by the day,' said Pope. 'Frankly, half of the population now needs help. People do not have access to shelter. They do not have access to clean drinking water. They do not have health care. Disease is spreading fast. One in every two Sudanese is struggling to get even the minimal amount of food to survive.' Pope arrived in Port Sudan Monday on a four-day mission to 'raise awareness of the needs and the cost of displacement' and to raise the profile of Sudan, which she called 'the most neglected crisis in the world today.' She said more attention must be paid to Sudan’s underreported conflict situation. 'Millions are suffering, and there is now the serious possibility of the conflict igniting regional instability from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa to the Red Sea.' 'The collective failure to act means the devastation risks spilling over into neighboring countries,' she warned, a warning shared by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, who expressed concern about the escalating hostilities and violence in Sudan’s al-Jazirah state. His spokesperson, Seif Magango, told journalists the high commissioner feared the fighting in al-Jazirah risked exacerbating further 'attacks against civilians, ethnically motivated violence and atrocity crimes.' He added that RSF ground forces reportedly have killed hundreds of people 'amid widespread looting' in recent attacks on villages targeted in the region. 'Reports also indicate at least 25 cases of sexual violence in several villages in Sharq al-Jazira locality, including three medical personnel and an 11-year-old girl, who died as a result. Women and girls were also reportedly abducted,' he said. A report released Tuesday by the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan accused the RSF of committing sexual violence 'on a large scale' in areas under their control, including gang rapes and abducting and detaining victims in conditions that amount to sexual slavery. 'There are reasonable grounds to believe that these acts amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including of torture, rape, sexual slavery and persecution on intersecting ethnic and gender grounds,' it said. The report also documents cases involving the SAF but concludes that 'the majority of rape and sexual and gender-based violence was committed by the RSF.' Besides the ongoing horrors, Turk’s spokesperson observed that RSF forces were committing other violations that threatened the welfare of the Sudanese people. 'There are reports of burning of crops,' said Magango. 'At a time when over 25 million Sudanese are facing acute food insecurity because of the ongoing conflict, destruction of crops in a region considered the country’s breadbasket can only exacerbate an already catastrophic situation.' Because of the ongoing violence, he said, thousands of families reportedly have been displaced from Al-Jazirah state into the neighboring state of Gedaref and nearby Kassala, 'adding to the already dire displacement crisis in the country.' High Commissioner Türk reiterated his call on leaders of both warring parties to promptly take measures to de-escalate the situation and 'to put a stop to violations by their forces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-displacement-crisis-worsens-as-fighting-hunger-sexual-violence-escalate/7843740.html	2024-10-29T12:26:08-07:00	
Teri Garr, comic actor of 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Tootsie,' has died	LOS ANGELES — Teri Garr, the quirky comedy actor who rose from background dancer in Elvis Presley movies to co-star of such favorites as Young Frankenstein and Tootsie, has died. She was 79. Garr died Tuesday of multiple sclerosis 'surrounded by family and friends,' publicist Heidi Schaeffer said. Garr battled other health problems in recent years and underwent an operation in January 2007 to repair an aneurysm. Admirers took to social media in her honor, with writer-director Paul Feig calling her 'truly one of my comedy heroes. I couldn't have loved her more' and screenwriter Cinco Paul saying: 'Never the star, but always shining. She made everything she was in better.' The actor, who was sometimes credited as Terri, Terry or Terry Ann during her long career, seemed destined for show business from her childhood. Her father was Eddie Garr, a well-known vaudeville comedian; her mother was Phyllis Lind, one of the original high-kicking Rockettes at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Their daughter began dance lessons at 6 and by 14 was dancing with the San Francisco and Los Angeles ballet companies. She was 16 when she joined the road company of West Side Story in Los Angeles, and as early as 1963 she began appearing in bit parts in films. She recalled in a 1988 interview how she won the West Side Story role. After being dropped from her first audition, she returned a day later in different clothes and was accepted. From there, the blonde, statuesque Garr found steady work dancing in movies, and she appeared in the chorus of nine Presley films, including Viva Las Vegas, Roustabout and Clambake. She also appeared on numerous television shows, including Star Trek, Dr. Kildare and Batman, and was a featured dancer on the rock 'n' roll music show Shindig, the rock concert performance T.A.M.I. and a cast member of The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Her big film break came as Gene Hackman's girlfriend in 1974's Francis Ford Coppola thriller The Conversation. That led to an interview with Mel Brooks, who said he would hire her for the role of Gene Wilder's German lab assistant in 1974's Young Frankenstein — if she could speak with a German accent. 'Cher had this German woman, Renata, making wigs, so I got the accent from her,' Garr once recalled. The film established her as a talented comedy performer, with New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael proclaiming her 'the funniest neurotic dizzy dame on the screen.' Her big smile and off-center appeal helped land her roles in Oh God! opposite George Burns and John Denver, Mr. Mom (as Michael Keaton's wife) and Tootsie in which she played the girlfriend who loses Dustin Hoffman to Jessica Lange. Although best known for comedy, Garr showed in such films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Black Stallion and The Escape Artist that she could handle drama equally well. She had a flair for spontaneous humor, often playing David Letterman's foil during guest appearances on NBC's Late Night With David Letterman early in its run. Her appearances became so frequent, and the pair's good-natured bickering so convincing, that for a time rumors cropped up that they were romantically involved. Years later, Letterman credited those early appearances with helping make the show a hit. It was also during those years that Garr began to feel something in her right leg. It began in 1983 and eventually spread to her right arm. By 1999 the symptoms had become so severe that she consulted a doctor. The diagnosis: multiple sclerosis. For three years Garr didn't reveal her illness. 'I was afraid that I wouldn't get work,' she explained in a 2003 interview. 'People hear MS and think, 'Oh, my God, the person has two days to live.'' After going public, she became a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, making humorous speeches to gatherings in the U.S. and Canada. 'You have to find your center and roll with the punches because that's a hard thing to do: to have people pity you,' she said in 2005. 'Just trying to explain to people that I'm OK is tiresome.' She also continued to act, appearing on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Greetings From Tucson, Life With Bonnie and other TV shows. She also had a brief recurring role on Friends in the 1990s as Lisa Kudrow's mother. After several failed romances, Garr married contractor John O'Neill in 1993. They adopted a daughter, Molly, before divorcing in 1996.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teri-garr-comic-actor-of-young-frankenstein-and-tootsie-has-died-/7843751.html	2024-10-29T12:25:57-07:00	
US reiterates 'one China' policy amid reports of Xi's request on Taiwan	Washington — Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is no change in its 'one China' policy which takes no stand on the issue. 'We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,' a senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. 'We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.' The confirmation followed reports that during their last in-person meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to change the language the administration uses when discussing its position on Taiwan independence. On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language stating it 'opposes' instead of 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements. The administration has been 'consistent on our long-standing one China policy,' the official said. Under the policy, the U.S. acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request for comment. Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts. The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice without some substantial concession from China on its own position about Taiwan,' Cooper told VOA. 'I doubt this will get any traction in Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.' Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima, Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in January. 'It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,' said Cooper. Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with Trump saying he would impose '150% to 200%' tariffs on China if it sought to blockade Taiwan. Flared tensions Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships carried out another 'combat patrol' near the island, following Beijing’s threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the United States. The administration announced it approved the package last week, which includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in Ukraine. Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself. China 'strongly condemns' the sale. 'We will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. VOA's Nike Ching contributed to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-reiterates-one-china-policy-amid-reports-of-xi-s-request-on-taiwan/7843735.html	2024-10-29T12:16:33-07:00	
Georgian opposition takes to streets to challenge election results	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgians flooded the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, late Monday, protesting what they see as a fraudulent election that secured another term for the ruling Georgian Dream party. Tens of thousands gathered outside the parliament building on Rustaveli Avenue, with Georgian, U.S. and European flags waving and voices calling for new elections. The rally, which opposition leaders called a show of defiance, came just two days after the release of preliminary results, which reported Georgian Dream leading with 53.9% of the vote, while the Coalition for Change, Unity-National Movement and other opposition groups significantly trailed. Speaking to the crowd, President Salome Zourabichvili, who has been critical of the government, took a bold stance. 'You, who are here, did not lose the election. Your vote was stolen, and they tried to steal your future,' she said. 'I can swear that I will be with you until the end, on this European road, and until we reach the door of Europe, which is not our dream but a reality. We have no other future and alternative.' The government denies the accusations. Shalva Papuashvili, the chair of the parliament, said, 'The elections were held in full compliance with democratic standards. The results reflect the will of the Georgian people, and any claims of widespread fraud are baseless.' The opposition alleges the election was rigged, while concerns have also been raised by Western countries and international observers. Larisa, one of the protesters wrapped in the European Union flag, expressed hope: 'We have faith in our European and American allies. There's always a reason to fight, and the truth must prevail.' She added, 'The elections were obviously rigged, and on such a massive scale that it's unimaginable. Until this government changes, I will continue to be here. This is the only path we have left.' Ana, a 20-year-old first-time voter, shared her dismay. 'I've never been this disappointed before. I can't believe this is happening. I truly hoped for change.' Another protester, Giga, stated, 'The people of Georgia are ready to fight until the end to bring our country back to the Euro-Atlantic path. We cannot and will not accept Russian occupation in any form.' Giga added, 'In many rural areas, 60 to 70% of the population relies entirely on state assistance. The pressure there is immense, especially in regions where young people have left, and there's no foundation of youth support. The government exploits this vulnerability, putting immense pressure on our parents' generation.' Large gains raise suspicions The results show that Georgian Dream enjoyed major vote gains in the regions, raising suspicions of fraud. In one municipality of Abasha, the ruling party increased its vote total by 19.98% over its showing in 2021 local elections. In another municipality, Dmanisi, the party’s vote total increased by 25%. The party, which is about to begin its fourth term, gathered more than 639,000 votes in the rural areas, reaching above 80% support in ethnic minority regions where fraud over decades remains an issue. In a significant move, all four major opposition parties have declared they will not take their seats in parliament, refusing to legitimize what they describe as a stolen election. Opposition leaders have called for a new vote, arguing that only fresh elections can restore public trust and legitimacy. 'We demand elections that genuinely reflect the will of the Georgian people, free from manipulation and fraud,' Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity-National Movement coalition said. Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's election watchdog, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, highlighted 'numerous irregularities' in the voting process and pointed to the controversial 'foreign agent' law adopted in June, which restricted freedoms and influenced the election environment. Nika, another protester, voiced his frustration: 'This government operates like a Russian regime, no matter how you look at it. In recent years, their governance has mirrored Russian tactics. The opposition may not be popular, but at least they are not serving Russian interests.' Hungary’s Orban booed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Georgia two days after the elections to show support for the Georgian government. As he was leaving his hotel on the main avenue where the protest was taking place, the demonstrators booed him. The next morning, at a joint press conference with Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, Orban said, 'I am convinced that nobody can question the legitimacy of the elections held in Georgia. 'No one should be dragged into a war unnecessarily, and the Georgian people have made their decision very clearly,' he said, echoing the Georgian government's position that voting for the opposition would mean a war with Russia. While Orban stood side-by-side with the Georgian prime minister, other EU foreign ministers in a joint statement voiced concerns about the conduct of the critical vote in the country of 3.7 million. 'The elections in Georgia were held under difficult conditions, and there are serious concerns about how the process was conducted,' the statement read. 'Upholding the rule of law and free and fair elections is integral to any progress on Georgia’s EU path. We criticize Prime Minister Orban’s premature visit to Georgia. He does not speak on behalf of the EU,' it read. A country at a crossroads The election took place in an atmosphere of tension and fear. Georgian Dream, led by Russian-backed businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, has long relied on an extensive network of state resources and alliances to maintain power. The party's control over public sector jobs and social benefits, especially in rural areas where economic opportunities are scarce, has been key to its grip on power. Over the years, Georgian Dream has also perfected the practice of 'managing' elections long before voters head to the polls, observers say. Local nongovernmental organizations and analysts maintain that the ruling party has relied on bribery, intimidation and fearmongering to ensure its continued success. 'Since the 2018 presidential election, Georgian Dream has relied heavily on coercion and fear of war,' said Levan Ramishvili, a political science professor at Tbilisi's Free University. The opposition claimed victory but struggled to make significant headway in Tbilisi, where electoral manipulations are reportedly less severe compared to rural areas. Aka Zakrua, executive editor of Realpolitik, an online publication, highlighted the uphill battle faced by the opposition. 'In order to change the government, the Georgian opposition must secure a large margin of victory, around 10 to 15%. Given the limited financial resources, compared to Ivanishvili's vast personal wealth, which is nearly a quarter of Georgia's economy, it becomes nearly impossible. 'This election has demonstrated that challenge, and now Georgian society and the political elite must decide whether such elections are acceptable or if changes are needed.' Zakrua noted that the opposition tried to win against Ivanishvili on his field, relying heavily on voters who were not ideologically committed but rather transactional. 'The opposition sought out people on local levels to gauge support and communicate with potential voters. Since people didn't have strong alliances or convictions to the cause, they switched sides when Ivanishvili's people approached offering more money,' he said. Ahead of the elections, the Georgian Dream campaign leaned heavily on the narrative of stability versus conflict, painting the opposition and their Western allies as part of a 'global war party.' The main message from Georgian Dream was that if the opposition won, it would mean war with Russia. In response, the opposition remained strategically silent. The fear of renewed conflict resonated with many Georgians, especially in light of the war in Ukraine and their own two wars with Moscow. 'That was the main contributing factor. People voted for status quo, not for a change,' Zakrua said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-opposition-takes-to-streets-to-challenge-election-results/7843647.html	2024-10-29T11:25:10-07:00	
As China sentences prominent dissidents, others protest behind bars	taipei, taiwan — A court in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou on Tuesday sentenced Chinese human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan, to prison. Yu and Xu were detained by police in April 2023 while on the way to meet with high-level European officials visiting China. They were later charged with 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' and 'inciting subversion of state power,' two crimes that Chinese authorities often use against dissidents. Yu was sentenced to three years in prison, while Xu, who had already been detained for more than 18 months, could be released in January. Their sentencing comes despite repeated efforts by the European Union and the U.N. Human Rights Council to draw attention to the case and call for their immediate and unconditional release. Tuesday’s sentences will have a chilling effect within the community of rights advocates in China, analysts said. 'This case will likely deter other human rights activists from trying to meet with foreign diplomats because Yu and Xu were accused of colluding with foreign forces even though they didn’t make it to the scheduled meeting,' Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo, told VOA by phone. Prison hunger strike Meanwhile, two jailed Chinese dissidents are protesting mistreatment, including around-the-clock monitoring and denial of contact with family. Prominent Chinese dissident Xu Zhiyong, who was sentenced to 14 years in jail on the charge of 'subversion of state power' last April, began a hunger strike after prison authorities instructed three other inmates in Xu’s cell to conduct around-the-clock monitoring, according to U.S.-based Chinese human rights lawyer Teng Biao. 'Since July, Xu has been required to get permission if he wants to go to the bathroom or leave his cell and whenever he leaves his cell, he will be closely followed by other inmates,' Teng told VOA by phone. 'Additionally, he has been forced to work in prison and deprived of phone calls as well as communicating with his family members through letters,' he said, calling the situation devastating for Xu’s mental health. Rights advocates say police have harassed Xu’s family. 'Chinese authorities have repeatedly threatened Xu’s family members not to disclose details of his case and not to contact anyone abroad or else they would be detained,' said Sophie Luo, the wife of detained Chinese human rights lawyer Ding Jiaxi. Teng worries the prolonged hunger strike, which started October 4, imperils Xu’s long-term well-being. 'I worry his physical and mental health will suffer irreversible damage,' Teng told VOA, adding that Xu has reportedly lost a lot of weight since beginning the hunger strike. In response to Xu’s hunger strike, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it is concerned about reports of the deterioration of his health. 'Our office has engaged with the Chinese authorities about his situation and urged for his immediate and unconditional release,' Thameen Al-Kheetan, public information officer at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, told VOA in a written response. Pushing back In addition to Xu, Chinese human rights lawyer Xie Yang, who has been in detention for more than 1,000 days, announced earlier this month that he won’t attend any court proceedings until his lawyer can access and copy his case files. Some analysts say Xu and Xie hope to attract more attention to their cases through their protests to put more pressure on the Chinese government. 'The fierce resistance put forward by these dissidents may push the Chinese government to restore some of their basic rights, such as access to medical care, which would be an improvement from the original treatment that they were receiving,' Yaqiu Wang, research director for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House, told VOA by phone. In a post on the social media platform X, which is banned in China, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said Washington is 'disturbed by reports that civil rights activist Xu Zhiyong is on a hunger strike in protest of inhumane treatment in prison.' 'We urge the PRC to release Mr. Xu and, in the interim, to treat him, and all prisoners, with dignity in accordance with UN member state obligations,' he wrote. VOA requested comment from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington but has yet to hear back. Beijing routinely dismisses criticism of its treatment of dissidents and human rights lawyers. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is 'a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected' in the country. Fear of further persecution In addition to Tuesday’s sentence and Xu’s hunger strike, Chinese human rights lawyer Lu Siwei was arrested earlier this month and charged with 'illegally crossing the border' in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Lu was repatriated back to China from Laos last year after trying to flee the country to reunite with his family in the United States. His wife, Zhang Chunxiao, who lives in the U.S., told VOA that prison authorities have prevented family members from sending medications to Lu and some of his health problems may not be properly addressed. 'He told the lawyer that the quality of the meals is bad so I’m worried about his health condition and since he broke his right arm earlier this year, I also wonder whether the daily work in prison would affect his injury or not,' she said in a phone interview. Based on the treatment that other Chinese dissidents in prison receive, Zhang worries that Lu may also experience torture or mistreatment while he waits for the final verdict. 'I’m very anxious and concerned because I don’t know what the Chinese authorities would do to my husband,' she said, adding that the international community should understand the charges or treatment against many Chinese human rights defenders like Lu are 'unreasonable.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-china-sentences-prominent-dissidents-others-protest-behind-bars-/7843631.html	2024-10-29T10:49:20-07:00

Vatican panel: Church must do better compensating sexual abuse victims	Vatican City — The Catholic Church must do a better job of handling compensation for the victims of clergy sexual abuse, the Vatican's child protection commission said in its first annual report on Tuesday. For decades, the Church has been shaken by scandals across the world involving pedophile priests and the cover-up of their crimes, damaging its credibility and costing it hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. The commission said compensation went beyond money, including 'a much broader spectrum of actions ... such as acknowledging mistakes, public apologies, and other forms of true fraternal closeness to victims/survivors.' Pledging to work for the introduction of 'standardized and known procedures ... in a more comprehensive way,' it said it would delve deeper into the issue of reparations in its report next year. Pope Francis, who set up the anti-abuse commission in 2013, faced some of the strongest criticism over clergy abuse during a September visit to Belgium, where the king and prime minister called for more help for victims. This month, a Vatican summit of world bishops ended with a final text apologizing several times for the 'untold and ongoing' pain suffered by Catholics abused by clergy. Tuesday's report called for greater transparency, with victims given more access to documents relating to them, and said investigations and trials by the Vatican's doctrine office (DDF) were too slow and secretive. During meetings with victims, 'the lack of communication was a permanent, constant complaint,' Colombian Bishop and commission secretary Luis Manuel Ali Herrera told a press conference. Chilean abuse survivor and commission member Juan Carlos Cruz said the lack of information was 'a form of re-trauma for many survivors, who have no idea where their case of abuse is.' Other recommendations included creating a Vatican Ombudsman for victims, ensuring more effective punishment of offending clergy, and an invitation for Francis to write an encyclical - the highest form of papal teaching - on child protection. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the Bishop Accountability abuse tracking group, said Tuesday's report amounted to window dressing. 'It doesn't focus on the central and devastating realities: that children in the Catholic Church are still being sexually assaulted by clergy, and that universal church law still allows these priests to be reinstated if certain conditions are met,' she told Reuters. The anti-abuse commission is the first of its kind in the Catholic Church, but abuse survivors have accused it of being toothless and several of its past members have left acrimoniously. The commission, which includes priests, nuns but also lay people and non-Catholics, was incorporated into the DDF in 2022 in an effort to increase its clout, but the report highlighted how it still struggles to make itself heard. As part of its dealings with national churches, it said it had sent a list of 10 detailed questions on child protection issues to all Mexican bishops, but only about 20% of them had replied. U.S. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who leads the commission but is due to retire soon, acknowledged past 'frustration at the slowness of change,' but said things were getting better.	https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-church-must-do-better-job-on-compensating-sexual-abuse-victims-says-vatican-panel/7843506.html	2024-10-29T09:42:29-07:00	
Authorities in Shanghai crack down on Halloween celebrations	In Shanghai, police, not trick-or-treaters and partygoers, are taking to the streets this week as the city approaches Halloween. The strengthened police force accompanies official notices prohibiting citizens from 'role-playing' on Halloween, signaling the government’s paranoia over the social instability the holiday’s festivities could bring. Videos online show police cars lining the streets of Shanghai, with some officers approaching crowds and instructing them to disperse from fenced-off areas. A leaked notice from the Huangpu subdistrict office identified any form of Halloween costumes, but especially role-playing costumes and makeup with gore, to be prohibited in public. Police have been instructed to persuade those in costume to leave or take off offensive garments and employ more coercive measures in the event of noncompliance. The police garrisons, protocols and general air of malaise in Shanghai find their roots in the local government’s fear of mass protest, according to Shanghai resident Ma, who declined to provide her first name out of fear of reprisal for talking to VOA. 'The Communist Party knows that 'a spark can start a prairie fire' and that many young people are now unemployed and unable to find jobs,' Ma siad. 'So they have deployed a large number of police forces on Changle Road and Julu Road, probably because they are worried that some of the freethinking young people will protest against the government in a strange way on Halloween.' Ma told VOA. Costumed people taken by police Some youth in Shanghai have appeared to ignore the warnings, gathering in Zhongshan park and the nearby streets to celebrate the holiday early. Online videos of the scene show some people in costume being taken away by the police, while others argue with law enforcement. At another celebration Friday night, in the Jing An district, Reuters reported that an attendee in a skeleton costume was detained by the police and escorted to an administrative building where he was asked to remove his makeup. Wang, a Shanghai resident who declined to provide his first name for his personal security, disagreed with the sudden tightening of restrictions on Halloween celebrations in his city. 'What can wearing a unique dress do?' Wang asked. 'As a normal, civilized society, this should not be a matter of concern at all. It is normal to ‘let the arts blossom’ and allow everyone to release their inner yearning for freedom. In a normal, civilized society, the police maintain the safety of the people. In our case, it's the opposite,' Wang said. Originating in the West, Halloween has found popularity in China in recent years. This is especially the case in Shanghai, known as China’s most international city and for its relative open-mindedness. In 2023, the city resumed the celebration of Halloween for the first time after the COVID-19 lockdowns, and some residents used this opportunity for self-expression to critique the Chinese government and political phenomena through costume. Some people dressed as Winnie the Pooh, a character that is often censored online in China given his likeness to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and others referenced past protests through covering their bodies in white paper. Ma believes that tensions this week between Halloween celebrants and local authorities are unlikely to escalate. 'Young people are indeed rebellious, but because of the education we have received since childhood, most Chinese young people dare not, and are unlikely, to rebel,' Ma said. 'Will the authorities completely control and prohibit Halloween? I don't think they will, but they will strictly control it. There will definitely be a lot of police in more important places. If any little thing happens, they will immediately send a police car to prevent the matter from escalating,' she said. Unique opportunity for free expression Chen Daoyin, an independent political analyst in China, told VOA that he believes that Halloween provides Chinese people with a unique opportunity for Western-style free expression. 'Most people, especially young people who dress up as characters on festivals like Halloween, have usually adopted Western culture, or at the very least know that people in Western systems have the freedom of expression,' Chen said. 'We have opinions about the current situation and the government, and can make our voices heard, but we also know that this is not allowed in the current political environment in China. Everyone knows what is going on. So they express their dissatisfaction with the authorities through dressing up as characters,' he said. Li Rongwei, executive director of the Taiwan Inspirational Association, however, told VOA that the holiday’s Western origins make it more susceptible to suppression. 'For China, Halloween is a product of the West, a typical capitalist bourgeois thing,' Li said. 'Since Halloween is a foreign thing and not a product of the so-called Chinese nation or China as the CCP believes, it is, of course, a class struggle and should be slandered,' Li said. October 27 marked the first anniversary of the death of former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, whose unexpected passing less than a year after he left the powerful premier position, sparked online conspiracy theories about the Chinese government. The Chinese government also might fear a social disruption akin to the 2022 White Paper Movement in protest of strict pandemic regulations that was referenced at Halloween celebrations in Shanghai last year. 'Social movements always have to have a reason, and it is conceivable to use Li Keqiang as the reason,' Lai said. 'This is also what the CCP fears the most. A tandem movement always has a theme. According to the perception of the CCP's top officials, it may be believed that this is a social movement planned by foreign forces.' But Chen believes that it is an over-speculation and inaccurate to link this year’s crackdown on Halloween with Li Keqiang and the White Paper Movement and says that there will not be any kind of uprising in China without an acute inciting incident. 'It is impossible for the youth of today ... to start a movement of any kind without the impact of a big event,' he said. 'So far this year, there has been no major event that can arouse empathy and emotional expression,' Chen said. Katherine Michaelson and Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-in-shanghai-crack-down-on-halloween-celebrations/7843440.html	2024-10-29T09:04:24-07:00	
Putin launches drills of Russia's nuclear forces simulating retaliatory strikes	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday launched a massive exercise of the country's nuclear forces featuring missile launches in a simulation of a retaliatory strike, as he continued to flex the country's nuclear muscle amid spiraling tensions with the West over Ukraine. Speaking in a video call with military leaders, Putin said that the drills will simulate top officials' action in using nuclear weapons and include launches of nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Defense Minister Andrei Belousov reported that the exercise is intended to practice 'strategic offensive forces launching a massive nuclear strike in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy.' Putin, who has repeatedly brandished the nuclear sword as he seeks to deter the West from ramping up support for Ukraine, emphasized on Tuesday that Russia's nuclear arsenal remains a 'reliable guarantor of the country's sovereignty and security.' 'Taking into account growing geopolitical tensions and emerging new threats and risks, it's important for us to have modern strategic forces that are always ready for combat,' he said, reaffirming that Russia sees nuclear weapons use as 'the ultimate, extreme measure of ensuring its security.' Putin noted that Moscow will continue to modernize its nuclear forces, deploying new missiles that have a higher precision, quicker launch times and increased capabilities to overcome missile defenses. As part of Tuesday's drills, the military test-fired a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from the Plesetsk launch pad at the Kura testing range on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Defense Ministry said. The Novomoskovsk and Knyaz Oleg nuclear submarines test-fired ICBMs from the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, while nuclear-capable Tu-95 strategic bombers carried out practice launches of long-range cruise missiles. The ministry said that all the missiles reached their designated targets. Last month, the Russian leader warned the U.S. and NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons for strikes deep inside Russia would put NATO at war with his country. He reinforced the message by announcing a new version of the nuclear doctrine that considers a conventional attack on Russia by a nonnuclear nation that is supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack on his country — a clear warning to the U.S. and other allies of Kyiv. Putin also declared that the revised document envisages possible nuclear weapons use in case of a massive air attack, holding the door open to a potential nuclear response to any aerial assault — an ambiguity intended to deter the West. Tuesday's maneuvers follow a series of other drills of Russia's nuclear forces. Earlier this year, the Russian military held a joint nuclear exercise with Moscow's ally Belarus, which has hosted some of Russia's tactical nuclear weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-launches-drills-of-russia-s-nuclear-forces-simulating-retaliatory-strikes-/7843429.html	2024-10-29T08:50:23-07:00	
UK, EU, Canada unveil new sanctions on Myanmar military	London — The European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions targeting the Myanmar junta's access to 'military materiel, equipment and funds.' The new curbs, against entities supplying aviation fuel and equipment to Myanmar's military, were aimed at constraining its 'ability to conduct airstrikes on civilians,' according to Britain. It said the month of August saw the highest number of airstrikes on record by the Myanmar military, killing dozens of civilians and amounting to 'gross human rights violations.' The sanctions — the latest by Western countries since a February 2021 military coup ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's government — target six entities involved in providing aviation fuel or restricted goods to the junta. They bolster several previous rounds of curbs against suppliers of aviation fuel to the military and arms dealers in 2023. 'The human rights violations taking place across Myanmar, including airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, by the Myanmar military is unacceptable and the impact on innocent civilians is intolerable,' junior U.K. foreign minister Catherine West said. 'That is why today the U.K. is announcing fresh sanctions targeting the suppliers of equipment and aviation fuel to the Myanmar military. 'Alongside the EU and Canada, we are today further constraining the military's access to funds, equipment and resources.' West added the U.K. remained 'steadfast in our support for the Myanmar people and their aspirations for a peaceful and democratic future.' The U.K.'s Foreign Office in London said Britain had provided more than $195 million in humanitarian assistance, health care, education and support for civil society and local communities in Myanmar since the 2021 coup. Over 3.4 million people have been displaced by the fighting, over 18 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, and Myanmar is now seeing 'a proliferation in serious and organized crime,' it added. The latest sanctions come as ethnic minority rebels and People's Defense Forces battling to overturn the junta's coup are riding the wave of a huge yearlong offensive. It has ejected the junta from around 50,000 square kilometers — an area roughly the size of Bosnia — according to analysts and an AFP tally, putting the rebels in sight of the former royal capital, Mandalay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-eu-canada-unveil-new-sanctions-on-myanmar-military-/7843387.html	2024-10-29T08:26:24-07:00	
Singapore looks to Australian outback to power shift to sustainable energy	Singapore — Singapore is a step closer to importing solar energy from Australia via a huge undersea cable, after giving the green light to an ambitious project that could provide a solution to other countries that are trying to make the shift to renewables. Australian company Sun Cable plans to build a 4,300-kilometer subsea cable which will supply the Southeast Asian city-state with just under 10 percent of its energy needs. Solar energy will be sourced from a 12,400-hectare solar farm in Australia’s Northern Territory, with some of the electricity generated also supplying the state’s capital, Darwin. Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has granted conditional approval to Sun Cable, stating that the project is 'technically and commercially viable.' The current timeline for the Australia-Asia PowerLink sees the cable being fully operational by 2035. Singapore has been forced to look further afield for more environmentally friendly ways to meet its energy needs, largely due to a scarcity of available land. Philip Andrews-Speed, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said researchers in Singapore had investigated how much energy could be produced from solar panels in the country. 'It was building on reservoirs, it was building over car parks and building over motorways. They came up with a number, but it was nowhere near what is needed. 'It’s also difficult to do much with marine energy because the seas are so busy,' Andrews-Speed told VOA. The Southeast Asian financial hub plans to import around 6 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035 and has conditional approvals in place with projects in Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam. It currently imports 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos through a cross-border project that includes Malaysia and Thailand. Whilst Singapore has looked to its neighbors to import renewable energy, the Sun Cable project would be a significant step up in terms of scale and logistics. 'A grid connection for 4,200-kilometers subsea has never been done before and has never been remotely delivered on. It is a very aspirational, game-changing proposal,' said Tim Buckley, founder of the independent research group Climate Energy Finance. 'There are significant geopolitical, financial and technical obstacles to this project and any project that goes subsea,' Buckley told VOA. One of the major challenges facing Sun Cable is the depth and diversity of the waters that the cable will be running through. 'They need to figure out whether they will be passing through tectonically unstable undersea terrain,' said Victor Nian, co-founder and chief executive officer at the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources. 'We know that Indonesia is sitting across the Pacific ring of fire, so if there are earthquakes or volcanic activity undersea, how would that impact the cable?' Nian told VOA. The sheer cost of the project has also proven problematic, with estimates coming in at $13.5 billion. Sun Cable ran into financial difficulties in January 2023, but was rescued by Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes. Even if the project does get off the ground, Singapore may be forced to pay a premium for the delivery of green energy, warns Buckley. 'Solar from the Northern Territory is very, very cheap, but by the time you deliver that to Singapore, it's exceptionally expensive because of the transmission costs.' Whilst there is still plenty of work to be done to make the Sun Cable vision a reality, similar projects have been completed elsewhere, although on a significantly smaller scale. The current largest subsea power cable runs 760 kilometers below the North Sea, servicing the United Kingdom with clean energy from wind turbines and solar panels in Denmark. It’s one of a number of cables linking the UK with Europe. 'They play a huge role in underpinning grid reliability and diversity and security of supply, and have played an absolutely central role in the UK shutting its last coal fired power plant,' said Buckley. Britain’s shift to renewables could further benefit from another ambitious subsea cable plan, with green energy sourced from a North African desert. 'The Xlinks project seeks to link renewable energy produced in Morocco with the United Kingdom via a 4000km subsea HVDC cable,' said Mutya Yustika, an energy finance specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, via email. The project is 'similar in scope and nature to Sun Cable' and would allow the UK to tap into 'abundant natural resources,' Yustika told VOA. Like Sun Cable, the Xlinks project faces numerous regulatory hurdles before work can begin, with a final decision to be made by the British government. Whilst these projects require cooperation among a small handful of countries, Buckley has voiced confidence that a global green energy power grid will one day be in operation. 'International grid connectivity will play a major role in helping to drive grid reliability, decarbonization and the optimization of matching energy generation to energy use.' Buckley sees Southeast Asia as one of the key starting points for a global grid, pointing to China’s involvement in the region. 'China Southern State Grid operates the Laos grid and they're underwriting the development of low-cost renewable energy.' This green energy can then be exported across the region, generating revenue for Laos where there is minimal domestic energy demand, says Buckley.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-looks-to-australian-outback-to-power-shift-to-sustainable-energy/7843331.html	2024-10-29T08:11:50-07:00	
Taliban publicly flog Afghan woman, 3 men amid UN outcry	ISLAMABAD — Taliban judicial officials said Tuesday that four people, including a woman, were publicly flogged in eastern Afghanistan for allegedly committing offenses such as 'illicit relations' and 'running away from home.' The United Nations has condemned such punishment being increasingly inflicted on Afghans under Taliban rule. The Supreme Court of the de facto radical Afghan rulers announced the latest punishments Tuesday, saying they were done in Nangarhar province after a local court sentenced the four 'criminals' to 39 lashes each. The Taliban’s top court reported earlier this week that five Afghans, including a woman, were flogged in public 39 times each in Parwan and Faryab provinces for committing acts that are considered crimes in Afghanistan, including adultery and homosexuality. It stated that the individuals were also sentenced to jail terms ranging from six months to one year. Since regaining power in 2021, Taliban leaders have imposed a criminal justice system in line with their strict interpretation of the Islamic law of Sharia, leading to the public flogging of hundreds of Afghan men and women. This has drawn persistent outrage and calls from the U.N. to halt the practice for being in breach of international laws and human rights. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, has stated in his latest report, released Tuesday, that the use of corporal punishment by the Taliban amounts to 'torture and other ill-treatment.' Bennett documented an 'alarming increase' in such punishment since the beginning of 2024. He quoted the Taliban’s Supreme Court as reporting that 276 Afghans, including 46 women, were publicly punished between January and August. 'While the vast majority reported in the 80 official announcements were for crimes such as theft and adultery, individuals were also punished for ‘crimes’ such as sodomy, homosexuality, running away from home, and aiding a woman’s escape from home — underscoring the specific risks faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other gender-diverse persons and cisgender women,' the U.N. envoy reported. Bennet said that the Taliban publicly flogged 63 people, including 15 women, in a single day in June, saying each person was lashed 15 to 39 times. He questioned the enforcement of the criminal justice system by the Taliban, saying that the situation is worsened by the absence of legal protections, including access to lawyers and denying other due process rights. 'There are credible reports of courts in several provinces denying defendants, including children, access to their lawyers,' Bennett said. The report also detailed an alarming rise in cases of sexual violence against Afghan women in Taliban custody. The Taliban defend their policies, including restrictions on Afghan women’s access to employment and work, saying their governance is in line with the Sharia. They reject international criticism of the Taliban government as an interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate ruler of the war-torn, impoverished South Asian nation, citing human rights concerns and the treatment of Afghan women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-publicly-flog-afghan-woman-3-men-amid-un-outcry/7843308.html	2024-10-29T07:38:35-07:00	
Japanese nuclear reactor which survived earthquake restarts	Tokyo — A Japanese nuclear reactor which survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear power plant was restarted Tuesday for the first time since the disaster after a safety upgrade, as the government pursues a renewed expansion of nuclear energy to provide stable power and reduce carbon emissions. The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan's northern coast was put back online and is expected to start generating power in early November, operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said. The reactor is one of the three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation. The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns. All of Japan's 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 is the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to return to operation. It is also the first restart in Japan of the same type of reactor damaged in Fukushima. Tohoku Electric President Kojiro Higuchi said the reactor's restart highlights the area's recovery from the disaster. Last year, Japan's government adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy, including accelerating restarts of closed reactors, extending the operational life of aging plants, and developing next-generation reactors, as the country struggles to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. 'Nuclear energy, along with renewables, is an important power source for decarbonization,' Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Tuesday. 'We will maximize its use while ensuring safety.' Restarting nuclear reactors is also increasingly important for Japan's economic growth, Hayashi said. Concern about the government's revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan's Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. Minor damage was reported at two nuclear facilities and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate. For the Onagawa No. 2 reactor, Tohoku Electric in 2013 began upgrading its safety, including tsunami risk estimates and anti-quake measures. It also built an anti-tsunami wall extending up to 29 meters (95 feet) above sea level, and obtained safety approval from regulators in 2020. Twenty-one of Japan's nuclear reactors, including six at Fukushima Daiichi and one at Onagawa, are currently being decommissioned because their operators chose to scrap them instead of investing large amounts for additional safety equipment required under the much-stricter post-Fukushima safety standards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-nuclear-reactor-which-survived-earthquake-restarts-/7843281.html	2024-10-29T06:57:30-07:00	
Cryptocurrency promoters on X amplify China-aligned disinformation	Washington — A China-linked disinformation operation is using so-called 'Spamouflage' networks to ramp up Beijing’s propaganda aimed at social media users in the West who regularly promote cryptocurrency-related content on X. Spamouflage accounts are bots pretending to be authentic users that promote narratives that align with Beijing’s talking points issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s human rights record, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza. The cryptocurrency accounts were discovered by a joint investigation between VOA Mandarin and DoubleThink Lab, a Taiwan-based social media analytics firm. DoubleThink Lab’s analysis uncovered 1,153 accounts that primarily repost news and promotions about cryptocurrency and are likely bots deployed by engagement boosting services to raise their clients’ visibility on social media. The findings suggest that some official Chinese X accounts and the Spamouflage operation have been using the same amplification services, which further indicate the link between the Chinese state and Spamouflage. Beijing has repeatedly denied any attempts to spread disinformation in the United States and other countries. From cryptocurrency to Spamouflage A review of the accounts in the VOA-DTL investigation shows that the majority of the posts were about cryptocurrency. Users regularly repost content from some of the biggest cryptocurrency accounts on X, such as ChainGPT and LondonRealTV, which belongs to British podcaster Brian Rose. But these accounts have also shared content from at least 17 Spamouflage accounts that VOA and DTL have been tracking. VOA recently reported on Spamouflage networks’ adoption of antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories. Spamouflage was first detected by the U.S.-based social media analytic firm Graphika, who coined the name because the operation’s political posts were interspersed with innocuous but spam-like content such as TikTok videos and scenery photographs that camouflage the operation’s goal of influencing public opinions. All cryptocurrency accounts have reposted content from a Spamouflage account named 'Watermelon cloth' at least once. A review of the account revealed that 'Watermelon cloth' regularly posted content critical of social inequalities in the United States, the Ukrainian and Israeli governments, and praised China’s economic achievements and leadership role in solving international issues. In one post, the account peddled the conspiracy theory that Washington was developing biological weapons in Ukraine. 'The outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war brought out an ‘unspeakable secret’ in the United States. US biological laboratory in Ukraine exposed,' the post said. X recently suspended Watermelon cloth’s account. Since Watermelon cloth’s first posting in March 2023, its content has been reposted nearly 2,600 times, half of which were by the cryptocurrency accounts. Most of the remaining reposts were either by Spamouflage or other botlike accounts, according to data collected by DoubleThink Lab. The investigation also found that the cryptocurrency accounts’ amplification on average almost tripled the view number of a post. Robotic behavior All 1,153 cryptocurrency accounts have demonstrated patterns that strongly suggest they are bots instead of human users. They were created in batches on specific dates. On April 6 alone, 152 of them were registered on X. Over 99% of their content were reposts. A study of their repost behaviors on September 24 shows that all the reposts took place within the first hour after the original content was posted. Within each wave of reposts, all took place within six seconds, an indication of coordinated action. At least one such account offered engagement boosting services in its bio with two Telegram links for interested customers. VOA Mandarin contacted the service seller through the links but did not receive a response. Chinese official accounts amplified The cryptocurrency group has also promoted posts from Chinese official accounts, including several that belong to Chinese local governments, state media and at least one Chinese diplomat. The Jinan International Communication Center was the third most amplified account whose posts the cryptocurrency groups have shared. Its content was reposted over 2,200 times. The Jinan International Communication Center was established in 2022 to promote the history and culture of Jinan, capital of the Shandong province in Eastern China, to the rest of the world as part of Beijing’s 'Tell China’s Story Well' propaganda initiative. A local state media account boasted in an article last year that Jinan was the third most influential Chinese city on X, which was then called Twitter. Other Chinese cities, including Xiamen and Ningbo, and provinces, such as Anhui and Jilin, had their official accounts amplified by the cryptocurrency group. Other amplified accounts include Xi’s Moments, a state media project propagating Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s speeches and official activities; China Retold, a media group organized by pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong; and the English-language state-owned newspaper China Daily. Zhang Heqing, a cultural counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, was the sole Chinese diplomat whose posts were promoted by the cryptocurrency group. DoubleThink Lab wrote in an analysis of the data and findings that Chinese official accounts and the Spamouflage operation have 'likely' used the same content boosting services, which explains why they were amplified by the same group of cryptocurrency accounts. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to answer specific questions about what appears to be a connection between the cryptocurrency group, Chinese official accounts and Spamouflage. But in a written statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected the notion that China has used disinformation campaigns to influence social media users in the U.S. 'Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes,' the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cryptocurrency-promoters-on-x-amplify-china-aligned-disinformation/7843243.html	2024-10-29T06:56:07-07:00	
Nigeria praises CAF decision in controversy over Libya's treatment of Nigerian footballers	Abuja, Nigeria — Africa's football governing body has sided with Nigeria in that country's dispute with Libya over a canceled qualifying game. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) awarded Nigeria a 3-0 victory over Libya following accusations Libya deliberately breached competition guidelines. Libya's football federation is appealing. The decision by the CAF puts Nigeria at the top of their division, Group D, and in contention for a spot at next year's Africa Cup of Nations, or AFCON, finals, in Morocco. The CAF on Saturday said Libya violated a rule that mandates that host nations receive and manage the logistics of visiting teams. The body also ordered Libya to pay a fine of $50,000 within 60 days. On October 15, Nigerian players returned home rather than play what would have been a qualifying match in Libya. They were protesting long delays at an airport about 250 kilometers away from the venue after their charter flight was unexpectedly diverted. Some news reports say the players were delayed by about 16 hours. Nigerian football fan Elvis Ume welcomed the CAF's decision. 'I think justice was served because the truth of the matter is that they genuinely put our players' lives in danger,' he said 'It was extremely malicious on their part. In my opinion they got off lightly. I think CAF could still have been a bit more firm in their decision for it to serve a sort of a deterrent to other countries.' But the Libya Football Federation, or LFF, denies deliberately trying to dampen the morale of the Nigerian Super Eagles players and has appealed the decision. Libya called the CAF's decision unjust and malicious. The federation accused the Nigerian team of using the reputation of its players - who are team members of various European leagues - to win global support on the matter. The LFF said its players faced similar challenges in Nigeria days earlier and that the situation is not unique to African football leagues. Sports analysts say common tricks may include immigration delays, lengthy trips or allocation of poor training facilities. 'When you look at antecedents, the North Africans especially Libya, Morocco, Egypt, they're known for this 'gamesmanship,'' said Nigerian sports analyst Bunmi Haruna. 'I think in Europe they call it the 'dark act.' This is the chance for CAF to let the whole world know ... it's not good for our football in any way.' Haruna said the CAF must continue to uphold this standard. 'I think it's a very good step from CAF and I hope it's not just going to be a one-off because these things happen even in club football. They want to go and appeal, which is good in terms of testing the laws.' It is very unlikely that the CAF will reverse its decision, but many will be watching to see the outcome of Libya's appeal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-praises-caf-decision-in-controversy-over-libya-s-treatment-of-nigerian-footballers/7843283.html	2024-10-29T06:55:56-07:00	
Chad president launches operation to fight Boko Haram after attack kills over 40 troops	Yaounde — Chad's President Mahama Idriss Deby has launched a security operation to track and neutralize several hundred Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed on Sunday more than 40 Chad government troops in the Lake Chad Basin, shared by Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger and Chad. Deby visited the area on Monday and assisted in the burial of his soldiers. Chad state TV reports that President Mhamat Idriss Deby has ordered that flags be flown at half-mast and that all radio and tv stations in the central African states should play only religious music for three days from October 28 at midnight. Deby announced on Monday the three days of national mourning after visiting Ngouboua, a western village in Lake Chad, on the island of Bakaram, near the border with Nigeria where Boko Haram fighters killed at least 40 Chad government troops on Sunday night, according to Chad state TV. Videos of Deby dressed in a military uniform and present at the burial of soldiers killed have been broadcast several times since Monday by local TV stations, including Chad state TV. After the burials, Deby announced the launch of 'Haskanite,' a military operation with fresh troops deployed to Lake Chad, to search out and eliminate members of the terror group hiding in the large area. Deby spoke on Chad state TV. He said as president of Chad, he is the supreme commander of government troops and guarantor of the security and safety of civilians, and that he has ordered Chad's military to protect civilians and their property by tracking and eliminating Boko Haram terrorists who committed atrocious acts on government troops and are hiding in the vast Lake Chad. Chad officials note that Haskanite is a strong and resilient plant that grows in deserts and in the Lake Chad area. The deployed government troops are experienced and have the equipment necessary to defeat the jihadists, Deby said. Chad military officials say they estimate the number of soldiers in the jihadist attacking force was 300 and that the surprise assault came Sunday at around 10 pm. In addition to the 40 deaths, several dozen government soldiers were injured, they said. Scores of the attackers were killed and the fighters succeeded to escape with some dead bodies and seized weapons according to Chad's military. Many civilians either died or were injured in the attack, Chad military says. Deby ordered that all civilians and troops receive medical care free of charge. Chad's military says the heavily armed jihadist fighters took control of the garrison before torching vehicles, motorcycles and buildings equipped with heavy arms. The attackers disappeared in the waters of lake Chad and surrounding villages. Saibou Issa, a conflict resolution specialist at Cameroon’s University of Maroua, says it will be difficult for Chad to singlehandedly fight the jihadists in Lake Chad. Issa says it is obvious that poverty and hardship push Boko Haram fighters who either surrendered or were weakened by the firepower of forces from Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger to rejoin smaller jihadist groups in Lake Chad. He says Lake Chad, which serves as a hideout for jihadist groups, is vast and only joint efforts from states that share the lake can stop militants, who are becoming more active. Issa spoke on Cameroon state Radio on Tuesday. He said the militants attack mainly for supplies and seize weapons from both armed groups and government troops in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Chad's government says it has informed the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, or MNJTF — made up of 11,000 troops and rescue workers from Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria — to assist in a renewed push against the terror group. VOA could not independently verify if troops of MNJTF have been deployed, but Cameroon says its military is alert. The United Nations says over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad. since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-president-launches-vast-operation-to-fight-boko-haram-after-attack-kills-over-40-troops-/7843203.html	2024-10-29T05:59:39-07:00	
Indigenous people voice concerns on Indonesia's new capital development	Indonesia is in the process of building a new, $32 billion capital city on the island of Borneo.

Gunmen kill 5 workers at southwest Pakistan dam	ISLAMABAD — Officials in Pakistan's violence-stricken Balochistan province said Tuesday that gunmen attacked workers at the site of a dam, killing five and wounding two others. The deadly shooting occurred in the Panjgur district of the sparsely populated Pakistani province renowned for its abundant natural resources. Residents reported that the assailants fled the scene on motorcycles immediately after the attack. A provincial government spokesperson, Shahid Rind, confirmed casualties, saying district authorities launched an investigation into the attack. The two injured men and bodies have been transferred to a local hospital, he said. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the violence in Balochistan, where several separatist groups are active and routinely target Pakistani security forces as well as government installations. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Tuesday’s attack. 'Those who attacked the personnel working on the dam are enemies of the development in Pakistan and Balochistan,' Sharif’s office in Islamabad quoted him as saying. Earlier this month, heavily armed assailants stormed a coal mine in the impoverished province’s Duki district and killed 21 coal workers. The Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, has been blamed for or claimed most of the recent attacks. The insurgent group, listed as a global terrorist organization by the United States, claims to be fighting for the province’s independence. The BLA also took credit for a suicide car bombing in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in early October that officials said resulted in the deaths of two Chinese engineers and several local security personnel. Separately, gunmen killed a police officer Tuesday in an attack targeting a health office in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where polio vaccination teams had gathered as part of an ongoing national immunization campaign. The deadly shooting in the Orakzai district prompted authorities to suspend the anti-polio drive in the area. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but provincial authorities suspected Islamist insurgents could be behind it. Militants active in the area have previously targeted polio teams and their police escorts, suspecting them of spying for the government. The attack on polio workers comes as the number of active paralytic poliovirus cases in Pakistan surged drastically to 41 this year, up from only six in 2023. Meanwhile, Russia’s embassy in Islamabad said on its social media platform X that it was 'verifying reports about the alleged abduction of a Russian citizen' in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A report in The Moscow Times has identified the missing man as a tourist cyclist and a resident of the city of St. Petersburg. Pakistani officials have not commented on the reported abduction being claimed by militants loyal to the banned Pakistani Taliban outfit. Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both sit on the border with Afghanistan, have experienced almost daily militant attacks. The violence has killed more than 1,000 Pakistani civilians and security forces this year alone, according to the Islamabad-based independent Center for Research and Security Studies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-five-workers-at-southwest-pakistan-dam-/7843153.html	2024-10-29T04:52:36-07:00	
Sudan's RSF, allies sexually abused victims from 8-75 years, UN mission says	Geneva — Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allies have committed 'staggering' levels of sexual abuse, raping civilians as troops advance and abducting some women as sex slaves during the more than 18-month war, a U.N. mission said on Tuesday. Victims have ranged between eight and 75 years, said the U.N. fact-finding mission's report, with most sexual violence committed by the RSF and allied Arab militia in an attempt to terrorize and punish people for perceived links to enemies. 'The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering,' said mission chair Mohamed Chande Othman in a statement accompanying an 80-page report based on interviews with victims, families and witnesses. The report echoed investigations by Reuters and rights groups into widespread sexual abuse in the conflict. The RSF, which is fighting Sudan's army, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice. The paramilitary RSF has roots in so-called Janjaweed militias, which helped the military crush a rebellion in Sudan's western Darfur region two decades ago. In the current conflict, the RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan including in West Darfur where it is accused of carrying out ethnic killings against the Masalit people with the help of Arab militias. The U.N. mission said racist slurs against non-Arabs in parts of West Darfur state were widely used during sexual attacks, indicating ethnicity targeting. Forced impregnation One victim from El Geneina in West Darfur said her rapist told her at gunpoint: 'We will make you, the Masalit girls, give birth to Arab children,' the report said. In another case, a West Darfur woman was held captive for over eight months by RSF guards and impregnated by her main captor during repeated rapes, it added. In four other incidents, women were taken from the street before being beaten and raped then released or abandoned unconscious on the street. Perpetrators mostly wore either RSF uniforms or scarves concealing their faces, victims said. The report said it had documented a smaller number of sexual violence cases involving the Sudanese army, with more investigation needed. It also said it had credible reports that both warring parties had recruited child soldiers. Last month, the mission found that both the army and RSF had committed major abuses like torture and arbitrary arrests. Though pushed out of global headlines by the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts, Sudan's war has created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, with thousands killed, more than 11 million uprooted, widespread hunger and involvement of foreign powers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-rsf-and-allies-sexually-abused-victims-from-8-75-years-un-mission-says-/7843151.html	2024-10-29T04:43:56-07:00	
Trump ally Steve Bannon is released after serving 4 months in prison for contempt of Congress	DANBURY, Conn. — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He's also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday. Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction. A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race. When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a 'political prisoner.' 'I am proud of going to prison,' he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a 'corrupt' Justice Department. Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee. Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-ally-steve-bannon-is-released-after-serving-4-months-in-prison-for-contempt-of-congress-/7843149.html	2024-10-29T04:37:20-07:00	
Saudi energy minister commits to crude capacity levels and climate targets	RIYADH — Saudi Arabia is 'committed' to maintaining crude capacity at 12.3 million barrels per day, Energy Minister Prince Abulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh, he said the world's largest oil exporter would maintain its crude targets while also pursuing its climate aims. 'We will monetize every molecule of energy this land has, period,' Prince Abdulaziz said. That policy would be carried out hand in hand with other goals, such as emission reduction, he added. 'We are committed to maintaining 12.3 million (barrels per day) of crude capacity and we are proud of that,' he said. He was speaking ahead of an announcement, expected on Tuesday, about a carbon credit exchange involving the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund. Saudi Arabia backed a deal at last year's U.N. climate conference, COP28, giving countries more leeway to follow their own pathways to cleaner sources of energy. More than 100 countries had lobbied at that summit, held in the United Arab Emirates, for the 'phase out' of fossil fuels, but faced opposition from the Saudi-led oil producer group OPEC, which argued that the world can cut emissions without shunning specific fuels. 'We are not ashamed of our record when it comes to emissions,' Prince Abdulaziz told the FII conference. 'We are proud of it, but the pundits try to create a smoke screen not to allow us to be on the so-called higher moral ground.' He also said Saudi Arabia would update its national climate pledge under the Paris Agreement to raise its target. 'We ensure we will have a refreshed NDC [Nationally Determined Contribution] next year, and I can guarantee you out of knowing the number will be higher.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kingdom-commits-to-daily-crude-capacity-/7843136.html	2024-10-29T04:30:26-07:00	
Germany recalls ambassador to Iran over execution of German-Iranian national	Berlin — Germany has recalled its ambassador to Iran over the reported execution of German-Iranian national Jamshid Sharmahd and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires to voice Berlin's protest against the killing, the German foreign office said on Tuesday. 'We have sent our strongest protest against the actions of the Iranian regime & reserve the right to take further action,' the foreign ministry said in a post on X. Germany's ambassador in Tehran demarched to the Iranian foreign minister and protested in the strongest possible terms the murder of Jamshid Sharmahd, the post said, adding that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock subsequently recalled the ambassador to Berlin for consultations. Iran executed Iranian-German national Jamshid Sharmahd after he was convicted of carrying out terrorist attacks, Iranian state media said on Monday. Sharmahd, who also holds U.S. residency, was sentenced to death in 2023 on charges of 'corruption on earth,' a capital offence under Iran's Islamic laws. He was accused by Iran of heading a pro-monarchist group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing and planning other attacks in the country. His daughter Gazelle Sharmahd, also on X, demanded proof for his execution and called for the immediate return of her father.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-recalls-ambassador-to-iran-over-execution-of-german-iranian-national/7843128.html	2024-10-29T04:17:54-07:00	
Human Rights Watch: At least 11 killed in Mozambique vote protests	Johannesburg, South Africa — Police in Mozambique killed at least 11 people and injured more than 50 others in violence after a disputed presidential election this month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Tuesday. Protests have rocked the southern African nation since Daniel Chapo, candidate of the ruling Frelimo party that has held power since 1975, was announced winner of the October 9 election. Hundreds of opposition supporters took to the streets last week, leading to clashes with riot police. 'Mozambique security forces killed at least 11 people,' HRW said in a statement, adding that 'over 50 people suffered serious gunshot wounds' on October 24 and 25. Eight police were also reportedly injured, the rights group said. HRW said it interviewed 22 people, including victims, witnesses, physicians, journalists, government officials and civil society groups. 'Many, including children as young as one year old, inhaled tear gas that the police fired indiscriminately into residential areas,' the rights group said. HRW said it had been told by one doctor that he treated dozens of injured people and one victim had 'a bullet in his spine.' 'Mozambican authorities should promptly and impartially investigate alleged misuse of force and hold those responsible accountable,' said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at HRW. A local NGO, the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CDD), also counted at least 11 people killed in the violence, including six in Nampula province. More than 450 people were arrested, including 370 in Maputo, CDD said in a statement on Sunday, adding that at least 85 had since been released. Police have not commented on the reports by CDD and HRW but previously said that 20 people had been injured in the protests. Police also told AFP that one person had been killed in Nampula while another died in Niassa, without giving further details. Mozambique's electoral commission said Chapo won the presidential election with 71 percent of votes, while the main opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, backed by the small Podemos party, received 20 percent. On Monday, Podemos filed a lawsuit demanding a recount of votes. Election observers noted serious flaws before, during and after the vote. European Union election observers were among those who noted 'irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-at-least-11-killed-in-mozambique-vote-protests/7843119.html	2024-10-29T04:08:11-07:00	
Saudi 'Davos in the desert' opens with region on war footing	Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Global business leaders gathered in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a glitzy investor forum as conflict shakes the region and skepticism mounts over the Gulf kingdom's most ambitious development projects. The Future Investment Initiative (FII) debuted in 2017 as a showcase for de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's dream of diversifying the economy of the world's largest crude exporter away from oil. This year's three-day event is expected to draw more than 7,000 delegates including TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and the chief executives of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. It kicked off with a performance by South African opera singers and remarks from Yasir al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, about the kingdom's attempts to be a leader in artificial intelligence and the energy transition. But for the second year in a row, conflict in the Middle East was sure to shape panel discussions and side meetings. Last year's FII took place just weeks after Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza, with high-level speakers warning about economic turmoil should the fighting draw in other countries. A year later those fears have been realized, as Israel presses operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and carries out tit-for-tat strikes with Iran. Muhammad al-Jasser, chairman of the Islamic Development Bank, told a panel on Tuesday that the Gulf region was 'a bright spot in the region' but that the ongoing wars have been a drag on growth. 'The potential that was sitting there waiting to be cultivated is evaporating with all these conflicts and this level of uncertainty,' he said. 'Show must go on' While most speakers refrained from overtly political messages, American economist Jeffrey Sachs used his speaking slot to issue a full-throated call for the establishment of a Palestinian state. 'Why is there war in Gaza and in Lebanon and possibly spreading to Iran and further in this region? Because there's no state of Palestine, obviously,' he said. 'Because Israel blocks it, the United States blocks it, and until there is, there's going to be no peace in the region.' FII Institute CEO Richard Attias told a press conference in Riyadh this month that the gathering is not meant to focus on 'politics' and should instead tackle big-picture investments 'to build a better world.' 'We are an independent platform and we don't want to be, forgive me for the word, polluted by any political events,' said Attias, former producer of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'I am curating events for 35 years now, and I learnt one thing: The show must go on.' On Tuesday Attias announced that this year's FII would be his last as CEO of the institute. 'Doubters beware' This year's FII, sometimes referred to as 'Davos in the Desert', also comes as Saudi officials try to demonstrate progress on signature elements of Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 reform agenda. Authorities have reportedly scaled back 2030 size and population targets for NEOM, a planned futuristic megacity in northwest Saudi Arabia meant to feature a ski resort and twin skyscrapers 170 kilometers (105 miles) long. On Sunday, NEOM announced the opening of its 'first physical showcase', a luxury Red Sea island known as Sindalah featuring restaurants, hotels and yachting berths. 'There was so much skepticism over NEOM in the Western media that the Saudis had to do something to demonstrate their commitment,' said Jim Krane of Rice University's Baker Institute. 'The early opening at NEOM is probably designed to embarrass the naysayers by telling the world that Saudi Arabia is moving ahead. It's a 'doubters beware' message.' Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in May that 'shocks' including the war in Gaza were prompting officials to 'reprioritize' some aspects of Vision 2030. At a briefing with journalists in December last year, Jadaan said officials had decided to push the timeframe for some major projects past 2030, though he did not provide details and also noted that others would be accelerated. Saudi Arabia has enacted a series of oil cuts since 2022 in a bid to hike prices and is currently producing around nine million barrels per day, well below its declared capacity of 12 million bpd. Last month, the finance ministry said it anticipated a budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2025, citing increased government spending and lower oil revenues. Additional spending commitments meanwhile continue to pile up for events such as Expo 2030 and the 2034 World Cup, for which Saudi Arabia is the sole bidder.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-davos-in-the-desert-opens-with-region-on-war-footing-/7843105.html	2024-10-29T03:54:29-07:00	
Adidas reaches out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye	London — Adidas has reached an out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye to end all legal proceedings between them, the sportswear brand said on Tuesday, adding that no money changed hands in the agreement.

Malaysian landslide victims sue, accusing officials of negligence	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Survivors and family members of campers killed in a 2022 landslide at an agritourism farm in Malaysia have filed a lawsuit contending the disaster was caused by negligence – not only excessive rainfall as an earlier government report concluded. 'We want this lawsuit to bring to the public’s attention the real reasons why this tragedy happened,' said Tan Ei Ein, whose 7-year-old son, Zech, was killed in the landslide. The government 'is trying to save itself from trouble by blaming it on nature,' Tan told VOA, describing the report as a 'whitewash.' 'That way nobody needs to take any accountability,' Tan said. In December 2022, the earth swept over tents at a campsite on Father’s Organic Farm in in the rural community of Batang Kali, in Selangor state, about 50 kilometers north of Kuala Lumpur. The landslide left 31 people dead, including 13 children. Some of the 61 survivors had serious injuries. Disputing the cause Last year, the federal government issued a report on the tragedy that said the landslide was triggered by slope failure after unusually high rainfall over a period of weeks. The report said there was no strong evidence that human activity was a contributing factor. The report did not address standing questions about why a farm and campsite were able to operate in what experts call a risky location and did not mention an environmental assessment approved by a federal agency a decade earlier that said the area where the farm and campsite were located should not be developed. While the lawsuit also said rainfall was a significant factor behind the landslide, it additionally accused the state and local governments of multiple failures and said the property owner and farm operator also made careless missteps. Those entities, along with a state agency, a government-linked company and another private company, are targets of the lawsuit. No federal agencies are being sued. The landslide started downhill from a state government road on a section of a hill where there was a manmade embankment before striking the farm and campsite below. The lawsuit blames the Selangor state government’s public works department for shoddy construction when the embankment was built, which increased the likelihood of a landslide. The lawsuit also accuses the state public works department and Infrasel, a private road work company contracted by the state, of not conducting proper safety testing and necessary maintenance on the embankment. 'The government’s public report says that there was no one to blame but, more or less, an act of God, the rainfall caused the tragedy,' Teckwyn Lim, a geographer and honorary associate professor at the University of Nottingham Malaysia, told VOA. Lim is part of a team of scientists, lawyers and a geotechnical engineer who investigated the tragedy for the plaintiffs. 'What we are saying is that ‘no, it was actually the result of negligence from the authorities and also the landowners. If the people in charge, if the government had been doing its job, then those lives wouldn’t have been lost,’' Lim said. The government report did not blame any agency or private company, saying slope and road maintenance were conducted on a regular schedule. Development of the property Father’s Organic Farm was on property owned by Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort. Last year, VOA reported that Kong Yew Foong and his father Kong Hon Kong, who also goes by the name David Kong, were listed in Companies Commission of Malaysia records as directors at Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort. Earlier this year, Forbes listed David Kong’s net worth at $825 million. The lawsuit points to an environmental impact assessment (EIA) approved by the Department of Environment in 2013 that said the area where the farm and campsite were located was not to be developed. VOA was first to report on the existence of this EIA about one month after the landslide. In January 2023 correspondence with VOA, Malaysia’s Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change wrote: 'The area of which Father’s Organic Farm was built had been determined as a No-Go Area. Therefore, the development of Father’s Organic Farm was in violation of the approval conditions of the EIA report approved to Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort.' But the assessment was not addressed in the government’s landslide report. 'The fact that the government report makes no mention of the EIA suggests that they wanted to cover it up,' said Lim. 'The 2013 EIA says the site should’ve been kept as forest land and the implication was that’s because the site was too sensitive to develop, meaning it’s unsafe to develop.' The suit also accuses the campsite operator and the property owner of negligence for not following regulations because the farm and campsite were allegedly run without the appropriate business license, development permits and engineering approvals. The lawsuit says the local municipal council should have closed the campsite down for not following regulations. The plaintiffs also blame owners for clearing land and removing trees below the embankment, which they said might have kept the landslide from reaching the campsite. The lawsuit does not specify a figure for compensation for the families of the victims who were killed. The defendants listed in the lawsuit are BL Agro, which the plaintiffs say is the new name of the business that owned and operated Father’s Organic Farm and the campsite; Malaysia Botanical Gardens Resort; Selangor state public works department; Infrasel, a private road work company contracted by the state of Selangor; the Hulu Selangor Municipal Council; the state government of Selangor and the Selangor State Agricultural Development Corporation. VOA left messages for Amirudin Shari, who serves as the equivalent of a chief minister for Selangor state, but has not received a response. Amirudin Shari is not a defendant. VOA has also not received responses to its inquiries from representatives of the other defendants. 'We want accountability,' said Loh Teng Shui, the father of 7-year-old landslide victim Zech. 'So far no one has been held accountable and we want the full truth to come out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysian-landslide-victims-sue-accusing-officials-of-negligence/7843056.html	2024-10-29T02:17:59-07:00	
Israeli strike kills at least 55 in northern Gaza, health officials say	Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike Tuesday hit a five-story residential building in northern Gaza, killing at least 55 people. The strike happened in Beit Lahiya where officials said there were people believed to be trapped under rubble left by the attack. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized legislation passed by the Israeli parliament banning the main U.N. aid agency for the Palestinians, UNRWA. The law is set to go into effect in 90 days, which Guterres said 'could have devastating consequences' for Palestinian refugees. In a statement late Monday, Guterres called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law and said national legislation 'cannot alter those obligations.' 'The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole. As I said before, UNRWA is indispensable,' Guterres said. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement Monday that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees,' he wrote on social media platform X. Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. United Nations Security Council members urged Israel and Iran on Monday to end their spiraling cycle of tit-for-tat attacks on one another, following Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran. 'All sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. Iran’s foreign minister requested the Security Council meet in an emergency session following an early Saturday wave of airstrikes by Israel that struck missile factories in three Iranian provinces. Council members Algeria, China and Russia supported Tehran’s request. 'Now West Jerusalem is trying to involve Iran in confrontation -- Iran, which is showing unprecedented restraint under the circumstances,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, referring to Israel. Russia is a close ally of Iran. 'It is very difficult not to have the impression that West Jerusalem is intentionally raising tensions, despite the signals from Tehran that they are ready to refrain from further spiraling confrontation,' he added, referring to Israel. 'It is our view that such aggressive actions on the part of Israel are aimed at further stoking the flames of war, are unacceptable and need to stop.' Israel’s strikes came weeks after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel amid Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the Israeli strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy’s territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the attacks achieved Israel’s goals, including harming Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles. His envoy told the Security Council that Israel’s response was 'measured and proportionate,' but warned of stiff consequences if provoked again. 'To Iran’s leaders, take this as a warning: Israel has shown restraint. But from here on, you will see only strength,' Danny Danon said. 'Any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Iran’s envoy accused Israel of violating international law and the U.N. Charter and said Washington’s support had emboldened it to attack its neighbors. 'Regrettably, unwavering and unconditional support provided by the United States to Israel, coupled with its obstruction of the Security Council mandate as a permanent member, has emboldened Israel to persist in its crimes and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, and now against Iran, gravely undermining regional peace and security,' said Amir Saeed Iravani. He urged the Security Council to respond with 'firm and dissolute action' and condemn Israel’s actions. U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington does not want to see further escalation and she delivered messages to both parties. 'Today, the United States’ message for Israel remains clear: We will always help secure its people and territory from Iran and its terrorist proxies and partners,' she said. 'Our message for Iran remains clear, as well: Should it choose to undertake further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the region, there will be severe consequences. We will not hesitate to act in self-defense.' Gaza cease-fire Israel said Monday that David Barnea, the head of the Mossad spy agency, had returned from talks in Doha with his U.S. CIA counterpart, William Burns, and the Qatari premier, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, where they discussed a new 'framework' for a Gaza hostage release deal. 'During the meeting, the parties discussed a new unified framework that combines previous proposals and also takes into account key issues and recent developments in the region,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'In the coming days, discussions will continue between the mediators and Hamas to assess the feasibility of talks and to further efforts to promote a deal.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Monday, 'We need a cease-fire. This war should end.' Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants. The Israeli campaign has devastated much of the Gaza Strip, while the fighting and Israeli evacuation orders have displaced around 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people.

The potential impact of Trump’s tariff proposal	Former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed sweeping tariffs if elected for a second term: a 20% universal tax and 60% tax on goods from China. He argues that the policy will help create jobs, shrink the national debt and boost government revenue for public services, such as child care. Most economists, however, agree that it is ultimately U.S. consumers who will pay more. Economists also warn of unintended ripple effects that could do more harm than good to the U.S. economy. This explainer video explores how increased tariffs might affect U.S. buyers, domestic and foreign producers, and the budget.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-potential-impact-of-trump-s-tariff-proposal/7843021.html	2024-10-29T01:29:47-07:00	
Germany needs reform and investment to overcome recession, says IMF Europe head	Berlin — Germany needs both structural reforms and more investment in public infrastructure to overcome recession, the European head of the International Monetary Fund said in an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 'Without a functioning infrastructure, there can be no productive economy,' Alred Kammer told the paper in an interview published on Tuesday. In order to mobilize more money, it would also make sense to revise the current credit rules, Kammer said. 'We at the IMF already calculated this some time ago: The debt brake can be relaxed - and the government debt ratio will still continue to fall.' Finance Minister Christian Lindner has insisted on sticking with Germany's debt brake, which restricts the budget deficit to 0.35% of gross domestic product, despite a forecast second year of recession and a sluggish growth outlook. Economy Minister Robert Habeck, on the other hand, recently proposed a multibillion-euro fund to stimulate investment and remedy growth. Asked whether Lindner or Habeck was right in the German government's fundamental dispute, Kammer responded that 'a lot would be gained if politicians clearly communicated what their strategy is in the medium and long term.' This was particularly true for the climate-friendly restructuring of the country. 'Companies will only invest if they know what is going to happen in the next ten to 15 years,' Kammer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-needs-reform-and-investment-to-overcome-recession-says-imf-europe-head/7843024.html	2024-10-29T00:53:34-07:00	
Malaysia's former PM Mahathir discharged from hospital	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was discharged from hospital on Monday, his aide said, after the 99-year-old had been admitted earlier this month because of coughing due to a lower respiratory infection. Mahathir, who served as prime minister for more than two decades, has a history of heart problems and has been in and out of hospital several times in recent years. Because of his admission to the National Heart Institute on Oct. 15, Mahathir had been unable to attend a court hearing on a defamation case he had filed against the country's deputy prime minister. Mahathir will attend the court proceedings on Tuesday, his aide said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-former-pm-mahathir-discharged-from-hospital/7843020.html	2024-10-29T00:40:26-07:00	
DR Congo wants UN peacekeepers gone, but war around minerals complicates that	GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The end of one of the world's deadliest and yet most shadowy wars is as difficult to predict as the end of the large peacekeeping force meant to contain it. Congo desperately wants stability in its mineral-rich east, of intense interest to the global economy. But political friction means the government wants the longtime United Nations peacekeeping force there to get out. That would leave the vast region, overrun with dozens of armed groups including one affiliated with the Islamic State organization, with even less defense for millions of displaced civilians. But frustration has become so high with the peacekeepers that many Congolese want them gone, too. The Associated Press witnessed the dilemma on a rare visit and night patrol with the U.N. force now known as MONUSCO, which entered Congo more than two decades ago and has 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground. It patrols a landscape that feels far from the authority of Congo's government, with its dirt roads churned into slippery mud in pounding rains and residents long accustomed to feeling that, security-wise, they are on their own. Some of the region's armed groups are self-defense collectives. During a visit to one frontline town, Sake, about 24 kilometers from the regional hub of Goma, the AP spoke with militia members trying to defend the population from a resurgent group, the M23, and its sniper fire from surrounding hills. The M23 is backed by neighboring Rwanda, whose government denies it. The involvement of better-equipped Rwandan forces, with U.N. experts estimating up to 4,000 of them in Congo, has led to talk of war by Congo's government. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces, but clashes between M23 and other militias continue. 'We are fighting the enemy who is a foreigner in our country. They are not Congolese, but they want to take Congo,' said one fighter, Amini Bauma. Sake is one of the last main routes into Goma under government control, but fierce fighting this year forced most residents to flee, leaving boarded-up homes. About 160 civilians and soldiers came through Sake's military hospital during the summer, most with gunshot wounds, said Omar Kalamo, a nurse. In August, a bomb exploded behind the building, he said. Some who fled are now returning, finding little safety elsewhere. Bitakuya Buhesha found his house destroyed. But he said he'd rather brave the gunfire than live in displacement camps, which have been infiltrated by fighters. 'We've waited a long time and we don't know whether our army will win this war or if it'll be the M23 rebels,' he said. Many Congolese who once looked to the U.N. peacekeeping force with hope are now angry. Multiple protests, some of them violent, have targeted the force in recent years. Last year, at Congo's request, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to draw down the peacekeeping force and gradually hand over its security responsibilities to Congo's government by this December. But the soaring violence means that departure is now delayed. On a recent day, peacekeepers in armored vehicles pulled into a small base in the hazy hills outside Goma, its tents surrounded by looping razor wire and sandbags. Troops perched with a machine gun pointed in the rebels' direction. In recent months, clashes between Congo's army and M23 came within a mile of the base. The U.N. force is trying to find new ways to repel the rebels. Last year, it established new bases between the frontlines and about 600,000 displaced people sheltering around Goma. It is training Congolese soldiers in the hope that they can fill the security void once it leaves. 'If the belligerent armed groups had come forward and attacked the civilians, the MONUSCO would have changed its stance purely from defensive to offensive operations,' said U.N's center sector commander for North Kivu province, Brig. General Ranjan Mahajan. MONUSCO described the security challenges 'multiple and multifaceted' and said only one of its brigades is tasked to go on the offensive. That affects a single area, Beni, where deadly attacks have been especially frequent. The U.N. mission otherwise is defensive and works alongside Congolese forces and others. But some Congolese, who see the U.N. force as not aggressive enough, said any new efforts to protect them are futile. 'You can see that MONUSCO is there, but that's in name only ... People are dying, but it does nothing,' said Maombie Aline, a displaced person in Goma. And yet, the international community has warned that the U.N. force's pullout would leave a security vacuum. More than 80% of Congo's 7 million displaced people live in areas protected by the U.N., according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the peacekeepers' pullout from South Kivu province in June left critical gaps, and the Security Council shouldn't authorize further withdrawals until there's a plan to mitigate them. The U.S. is the force's top financial supporter. Congo's communication minister, Patrick Muyaya, said there would be a new timeline for MONUSCO's departure, but didn't give details. He said a joint team of government and U.N. officials was evaluating the situation. Goma's streets are full of armed men, local and foreign. In addition to the U.N. force and an unknown number of Congolese forces, there are about 1,000 foreign mercenaries, a coalition of local militia and a Southern African regional force. A recently deployed East African force was kicked out amid criticism it was ineffective. 'It's a military jungle,' said Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese researcher for the International Crisis Group. 'There are many actors, but everyone has their own agenda ... they can't make a difference because they are divided.' Global interest in eastern Congo's minerals is one reason the violence is so difficult to contain, experts said. Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and smartphones. It also has substantial gold, diamond, copper and cobalt reserves. In May, M23 fighters seized the town of Rubaya, which holds deposits of tantalum — used in electronics, including Apple devices —and extracted from coltan. The area is estimated to supply more than 15% of global production of tantalum and now generates about $300,000 a month for M23, said Bintou Keita, head of Congo's U.N. mission. U.N. experts in June said a portion of Rubaya minerals have been smuggled across the Rwandan border. Rwanda is selling minerals from eastern Congo and passing them off as conflict-free, said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit — allegations documented by both U.N experts and the U.S. Davids said the international community has hesitated to meaningfully call on Rwanda to stop the fighting because it has become a reliable trading partner for the West as competition grows for the minerals. Meanwhile, the Rwandan-backed rebels are accused of obstructing and threatening the U.N. mission so it can seize more territory, and are widely expected to benefit from its departure. Rwanda's government and M23 didn't respond to requests for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-wants-un-peacekeepers-gone-but-war-around-minerals-complicates-that/7843019.html	2024-10-29T00:33:35-07:00	
Fireworks explosion injures more than 150 people at a temple in India	NEW DELHI — A huge explosion of fireworks injured more than 150 people at a religious festival in a temple in southern India, a report said Tuesday. The explosion occurred Monday night when a fireworks storage facility near Veerarkavu temple caught fire, the Press Trust of India reported, citing the police. It happened in Kasargod, which is nearly 580 kilometers (360 miles) northwest of Thiruvananthapuram, the Kerala state capital, The injured were treated at various hospitals in Kasargod, Kannur, and Mangaluru districts. Eight of them had serious injuries. There is a huge demand in India for firecrackers, which are used in religious festivals and weddings. Fatal accidents occur nearly every year as people work in makeshift factories without proper safety measures. An explosion at a fireworks factory in southern India July last year killed eight people. In 2018, a massive fire at a firecracker factory in New Delhi killed 17 workers. A year earlier, a blast killed 23 people while they were making firecrackers in a village in Madhya Pradesh state in central India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fireworks-explosion-injures-more-than-150-people-at-a-temple-in-india/7843016.html	2024-10-29T00:06:07-07:00	
China's Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan, sources say	WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI — Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation. During last November's Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S. official statements. China wanted the U.S. to say 'we oppose Taiwan independence,' rather than the current version, which is that the United States 'does not support' independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated in or were briefed on. Xi's aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person familiar with the exchanges. The U.S. has declined to make the change. The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan independence. 'The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on our long-standing One China policy,' the statement read. China's foreign ministry said: 'You should ask this question to the U.S. government. China's position on the Taiwan issue is clear and consistent.' Taiwan's foreign ministry declined comment. The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains Taiwan's formal name and the government says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign, independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its own. Sensitive issue For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to make changes to how it refers to Taiwan's status, which remains the most sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed push at the leader level has not been reported previously. The United States severed official relations with the government in Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office and China's military has significantly ramped up its activities around the island in recent years. The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a non-starter. Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by Washington, said one of the sources. Leaders in Beijing 'would love it if Joe Biden said very different things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt,' said one senior Biden administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence. During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S. position of 'strategic ambiguity.' Change would reverberate A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S. partners, competitors and adversaries alike. Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward less support for Taipei's defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time when Beijing has ramped up military pressure. China has over the past five years staged almost daily military activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground targets. Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S. policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan's future through peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play. Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new state. In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence for the island. The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden's term in office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines of next month's G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part. The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-pressed-biden-to-alter-language-on-taiwan-sources-say/7843008.html	2024-10-28T23:40:03-07:00	
South Korea says Russia-North Korea military cooperation ‘poses significant security threat’	PENTAGON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday that military cooperation between North Korea and Russia 'poses a significant security threat to the international community.' The comments at a Cabinet meeting in Seoul followed Yoon saying Monday that the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield in Ukraine could happen 'more quickly than anticipated,' according to South Korean intelligence assessments. The U.S. Defense Department said Monday that North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to train in Russia, more than tripling the previous estimate. 'We believe that the DPRK has sent around 10,000 soldiers in total to train in eastern Russia that will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks,' deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters at the Pentagon, using an abbreviation for North Korea’s official name. 'A portion of those soldiers have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we are increasingly concerned that Russia intends to use these soldiers in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk oblast, near the border with Ukraine,' she added. Earlier on Monday, NATO confirmed that 3,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia to help Moscow fight its war against Ukraine and have also been deployed to Russia’s Kursk region where Kyiv’s forces invaded in a surprise attack in August and still hold territory. 'The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security,' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Brussels after NATO officials and diplomats received a briefing from a South Korean delegation of intelligence and military officials. The NATO secretary general said the deployment of North Korean troops was a sign of 'growing desperation' on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rutte added that more than 600,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Pentagon did not provide further details on the type of troops or equipment that North Korea had sent with their troops. When pressed by VOA on what types of capabilities these troops could bring, Singh said, 'It’s additional bodies on the battlefield.' 'If we see DPRK troops moving in and towards the front lines, they are co-belligerents in the war,' she warned. Russia and North Korea have boosted their political and military alliance since Moscow’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Gen. David Allvin, the chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, told VOA Friday at a Military Reporters and Editors conference that increased cooperation between the two malign actors is 'certainly a cause for more consideration and investigation.' The Kremlin had dismissed reports about a North Korean troop deployment as 'fake news.' But Putin last week did not deny that North Korean troops were currently in Russia and said that it was up to Moscow to decide how to deploy them as part of a mutual defense security pact he signed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June. At odds with Putin’s comments, a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York last week characterized the reports of Pyongyang’s deployment of troops in Russia as 'groundless rumors.' U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will host his South Korean counterpart, Kim Yong-Hyun, on Wednesday at the Pentagon, where the two are expected to discuss the North Korean troops who are now in Russia. Drone warfare Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian aerial attacks killed at least four people in the Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram the attack destroyed two houses and damaged about 20 others. Russian attacks overnight also targeted Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, injuring at least six people, according to Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said falling debris from a downed Russian drone ignited a fire at a residential building. In the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine, officials said a Russian rocket attack killed one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down seven Ukrainian drones overnight, including two over the Belgorod region, two over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over the Black Sea. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram the Ukrainian attack damaged several residential buildings.

Myanmar opposition: Dialogue impossible, China must rethink junta support	Despite efforts by China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to resolve Myanmar's political and economic crisis, opposition leader Zaw Wai Soe told VOA that dialogue with the military regime is impossible amid ongoing atrocities. Zaw Wai Soe is a minister in Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG), a shadow government of former lawmakers and opponents created after the February 2021 coup. 'The military must have no place in politics,' he said. Speaking to VOA in Washington after attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September, Zaw Wai Soe commented on opinions that humanitarian aid to victims of Typhoon Yagi in early September could provide a political way out. 'They continue to drop bombs, and it is obvious they are committing war crimes,' he said. 'It is impossible to engage in dialogue with such an organization.' The military has appealed to the opposition to negotiate. According to Tu Maung Nyo, a political columnist based along the Myanmar-Thailand border, the military’s recent calls to end the conflict indicate an attempt 'to achieve on the table what they cannot accomplish on the battlefield.' He added, 'This approach has been used repeatedly whenever the military faces political or military crises.' On October 15, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's military leader, called on ethnic rebel groups to engage in peace talks to end armed conflicts, marking the second appeal for negotiations in less than a month. Military’s view on crisis VOA contacted Myanmar's military regime, the State Administration Council (SAC), to comment on Zaw Wai Soe's statements but did not receive a direct response at the time of publication. In September, in an effort to start peace talks, SAC spokesperson Zaw Min Tun told the media that 'the military is committed to solving political problems through political means.' The day after, the military made its first public appeal since the coup, calling on its opponents, including the People’s Defense Force, to lay down their weapons and return to the political process to end the country's conflict. SAC urged ethnic armed organizations and 'terrorist insurgent groups' to 'communicate with us to solve political problems politically' and participate in the military-managed election it plans to hold next year. Doubts over cease-fire Analysts and critics question the sincerity of the military's calls for peace, given its ongoing airstrikes. Jason Tower, Burma program director at the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), noted that the military’s actions, especially its airstrike campaigns, contradict any genuine interest in a cease-fire. 'It’s pretty clear that there’s absolutely no interest on the part of the regime in a cease-fire,' he said. 'If there were any negotiations, it would really require that the regime make major concessions to ethnic armed organizations.' According to Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow in the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute, the crisis poses a significant challenge to regional stability. ASEAN has struggled to find a cohesive strategy since adopting a Five-Point Consensus in 2021. Progress has been limited, as highlighted in the recent ASEAN Summit in Laos. Regional partners such as Singapore have urged the United States and China to assist ASEAN in finding a solution for Myanmar, which is strategically significant to China's global policy, particularly concerning the 'Malacca Dilemma'— China's reliance on the Strait of Malacca for oil imports. Skepticism over China's approach China has positioned itself as a mediator in the Myanmar conflict, advocating cease-fires and dialogue between the junta and ethnic armed organizations. According to a commentary by Kyi Sin, a research officer at the Myanmar study program at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, China has adapted its approach by forging security agreements with all parties involved in the civil war and mediating or participating in peace talks, signaling a potentially more assertive stance toward Myanmar’s ongoing conflict. In an email to VOA, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu reaffirmed that China advocates for all parties in Myanmar to cease hostilities and resolve issues through dialogue. China's strategic interest in Myanmar is securing infrastructure projects like the Sino-Myanmar pipeline, which links Myanmar’s deep-water port of Kyaukphyu in the western part of the country in the Bay of Bengal with Kunming in Yunnan, an inland province in southwestern China. The Chinese state media outlet Global Times reported in 2023 that approximately 52 billion cubic meters of natural gas have been transported through the Sino-Myanmar pipeline since it began operation on July 28, 2013, reaching its intended transmission capacity. The report cited China National Petroleum Corp., a state-owned oil company. Tower noted that fighting near the pipeline complicates China's efforts to maintain regional stability. 'China's geostrategic investments are already in the crossfire,' he said. Malaysia will be ASEAN’s chair in 2025. Its prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has pledged to strengthen engagement and push for decisive action on human rights violations in Myanmar. Malaysia, hosting about 200,000 Myanmar refugees, has a direct stake in resolving the crisis. A recent USIP report highlighted areas for Malaysia to target: pushing back against China's dominance, ensuring the opposition has a voice within ASEAN, and increasing leverage over the military regime. Obstacles to peace International experts like Yaacob and Tower highlighted the challenge that Myanmar’s political and humanitarian crises pose for ASEAN and the international community, noting that while regional powers such as China advocate for dialogue, the opposition argues meaningful negotiations are impossible amid ongoing atrocities. Zaw Wai Soe stressed that for meaningful change, 'China needs to rethink its policy of supporting an extreme, violent organization that is against the people and all ethnic groups.' Yaacob summed up the stakes ahead for China, 'What will make any Chinese involvement successful is China cutting off arms supply to the junta. That could force the junta to rethink its position and move toward a peaceful transfer of power.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-opposition-dialogue-impossible-china-must-rethink-junta-support/7842993.html	2024-10-28T22:27:22-07:00	
Biden, allies call for Mideast cease-fire after weekend strikes	President Joe Biden on Monday urged an end to the grueling Mideast conflict after Israel struck Iran early Saturday in what Washington said was justified retaliation for a strike on Israel earlier this month.

Guinea authorities dissolve dozens of political parties with no election date set	CONAKRY, Guinea — Guinea authorities dissolved dozens of political parties and placed two major opposition ones under observation late Monday, while the transitional government has yet to announce a date for elections. The West African country has been led by a military regime since soldiers ousted President Alpha Conde in 2021. The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS has pushed for a return to civilian rule and elections are scheduled for 2025. The mass dissolution of 53 political parties and required observation of 54 others for three months is unprecedented in Guinea, which held its first democratic election in 2010 after decades of authoritarian rule. The Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization announced the moves based on an evaluation of all political parties begun in June. The evaluation was meant to 'clean up the political chessboard,' according to the ministry. The 67 parties that will be under observation for three months can operate normally but must resolve irregularities noted in the report. Those parties include the Rally of the Guinean People, which is the party of former President Alpha Condé, and another major opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea. The authorities said the parties placed under observation failed to hold their party congress within the time limit and to provide bank statements, among other issues. Guinea is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken power and delayed a return to civilian rule. Earlier this year, the military junta in Burkina Faso extended its transition term by five years. Col. Mamadi Doumbouya, who leads Guinea, overran the president three years ago, saying he was preventing the country from slipping into chaos and chastised the previous government for broken promises. However, since coming to power he's been criticized by some for being no better than his predecessor. In February, the military leader dissolved the government without explanation, saying a new one will be appointed. Doumbouya has rebuffed attempts by the West and other developed countries to intervene in Africa's political challenges, saying Africans are 'exhausted by the categorizations with which everyone wants to box us in.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-authorities-dissolve-dozens-of-political-parties-with-no-election-date-set/7842956.html	2024-10-28T20:00:56-07:00	
Knife attack near school in Beijing injures 5 people, including 3 children	Beijing — A knife attack near a school in China's capital on Monday injured five people, including three children, police said. The attack occurred midafternoon in Beijing's northwestern Haidian district. None of the injuries was life-threatening, police said in a statement. A 50-year-old suspect surnamed Tang was detained at the scene and is under investigation, police said. The location of the attack given by the statement is near a famous primary school. Video circulating on social media showed two school-aged children on the ground. Another image showed a man with blood on his face being held to the ground. Multiple knife attacks have occurred in China this year, including several involving school children. Last month, a 10-year-old Japanese student died after being attacked with a knife near his school in the southern city of Shenzhen. Another attack in June at a school bus stop for a Japanese school in Suzhou injured a woman and her child. A Chinese woman who tried to intervene was killed. In early October, three people were killed and 15 others were wounded in a knife attack in a Shanghai supermarket. China tightly restricts private gun ownership, making knives and homemade explosives among the most common weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/knife-attack-near-school-in-beijing-injures-5-people-including-3-children/7842930.html	2024-10-28T19:06:20-07:00	
Washington Post's Bezos defends decision to end presidential endorsements	Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate after a report that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions following the move. The decision blocked an endorsement of Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, the National Public Radio report said, and many people in messages on the newspaper's website criticized Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon.com and rocket company Blue Origin. Bezos, in an opinion piece late on Monday, said 'most people believe the media is biased' and the Washington Post and other newspapers needed to boost their credibility. No candidate was informed or consulted about the decision and that there was 'no quid pro quo,' Bezos said, adding that there was no connection between the decision and a meeting between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Blue Origin's CEO on the same day. 'Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,' Bezos wrote. 'What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.' The subscription cancellations as of midday represented about 8% of the paper's paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well, reported NPR, which said a series of columnists had resigned their positions in protest. The Washington Post declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters. In a post on Friday, William Lewis, The Washington Post's publisher and CEO, said the newspaper would not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election, nor in any future presidential election. 'We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,' Lewis wrote. 'The Washington Post's decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,' wrote 20 columnists in an opinion piece on the Post's website, adding that it 'represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-post-s-bezos-defends-decision-to-end-presidential-endorsements/7842916.html	2024-10-28T18:40:43-07:00	
US, South Korea to confer on North Korean troop deployment to Russia	state department — Top diplomatic and military officials from the United States and South Korea are set to convene in Washington this Thursday as the two allies closely monitor and express concerns about North Korea's deployment of about 10,000 troops to Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. officials and analysts say that China could be displeased by Russia's growing influence over North Korea, and that if Beijing chose, it could restrict exports of materials that Pyongyang might use for munitions production. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will co-host South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul and Minister of Defense Kim Yong-hyun to coordinate on pressing security threats facing the alliance. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during Monday’s briefing that high on the agenda would be discussion of 'North Korea's expanding relationship with Russia,' which includes the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia; various other provocative actions by North Korea in recent months; and the U.S. commitment to security in the Indo-Pacific region. The consultation between Washington and Seoul will come two weeks after establishment of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, a group formed by the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies to better coordinate enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. The group said that while 'the path to dialogue' with North Korea remained open, it was committed to 'safeguard the global nonproliferation regime and address the threat arising from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s [DPRK, North Korea’s official name] weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.' Some analysts suggest that by sending troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, North Korea may gain an opportunity to test the effectiveness of its ballistic missiles and munitions. 'We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,' Miller added. He was referring to People’s Republic of China. Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that while China has been supportive of Russia’s war in Ukraine, North Korea’s involvement introduces an unsettling dynamic. 'For one,' Cha said, 'China does not like Russia to have so much influence over North Korea.' Cha added that Beijing could take specific actions, such as curbing exports of petroleum coke to North Korea, which can be used in munitions production. 'According to recent public reports, imports of this good [used for steel production] have dramatically increased while overall trade has only slowly started to return to normal,' he said. Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Austin would also meet with his South Korean counterpart Wednesday, when he will host Kim at the Pentagon for the 56th U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting. ROK refers to South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

Biden hosts White House Diwali reception	U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the start of the five-day festival of Diwali — the celebration that symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and is marked by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world, especially in India. Biden began the White House festivities by lighting a small prayer lamp known as a diya. Several hundred guests — including South Asian administration officials, elected officials, prominent community members and others — wore silks and embroidered finery and thronged the White House’s massive and heavily chandeliered East Room for the occasion. But Biden used the occasion to shine a light on someone who was not in the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris, the most prominent South Asian American, who was busy on the campaign trail as the election swiftly approaches. Her late mother immigrated to the United States from what was then the Indian city of Madras, now called Chennai. 'One of the things we bonded over was the role each of our mothers played in our lives,' Biden said. 'They come from different places, different generations, different lives, but they shared a basic belief about America: Only in America is anything possible. Only in America.' And, he said, after hundreds of years of struggle, South Asian Americans have made the U.S. their home. 'Diwali is celebrated openly and proudly here in the White House,' he said. 'And by the way, this is not my house. This is your house.' The festival starts on the darkest night of the year, per the Hindu lunar calendar — October 31, according to the Indian government. The day is a national holiday. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was visibly moved by the occasion, spoke of how his parents’ faith illuminated their path after they immigrated to the U.S. from India. 'That is the message of Diwali,' he said. 'Choose light always, whatever the future may bring. Whatever the future may bring, it is our light and our fierce commitment to one another that will see us through to a better day.' And joining the festivities from afar was International Space Station commander Sunita Williams. Her father immigrated to the U.S. from India; her mother, from Slovenia. She spoke to the White House crowd via a recorded message from 420 kilometers (260 miles) above the Earth. 'On this day, I specifically think about my father, who immigrated to the U.S. from India,' she said. 'He kept and shared his cultural roots by teaching us about Diwali and other Indian festivals. Diwali is a time of joy, as goodness in the world prevails. I am so thankful to have grown up in a multicultural household where our parents encouraged us to seek opportunities and reach for the stars.' Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential celebrations of Diwali that date to President George W. Bush's time in office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali celebrations. The festival marks the return of the mythical Lord Ram, named in Sanskrit scripture as a reincarnation of the god Vishnu, from exile after 14 years. The people of his kingdom, Ayodhya, lit lamps to illuminate his path home — a tradition that merrymakers continue today with lamps and pyrotechnics. Indian Americans are the largest non-mixed Asian group in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with nearly 4.4 million people identifying as 100% Indian in origin. Today, celebrants around the world honor the occasion with new clothes, extravagant decorations and massive quantities of sugar-laden confections. This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the top proponent of a Hindu-nationalist movement known as Hindutva, saw a sweet named in his honor. The so-called 'Modi Laddu' — the Modi Ball — is made of saffron, clarified butter, pistachios, almonds and rose water. But there is also a vein of bitterness in India’s observance of this holiday. Modi was the driving force behind the rebuilding of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, on what was thought to be Ram’s birthplace. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a mosque on that site, prompting deadly religious riots that were the worst since India’s independence, leaving more than 2,000 people dead. Modi spent years raising funds to erect a massive Hindu temple on the ruins. He opened it earlier this year, saying, 'Today, our Ram has come.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-hosts-white-house-diwali-reception-/7842893.html	2024-10-28T18:04:23-07:00	
UN Security Council members urge restraint between Israel and Iran	United Nations Security Council members urged Israel and Iran on Monday to end their spiraling cycle of tit-for-tat attacks on one another, following Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran. 'All sides must exercise restraint. No good can come of pouring more fuel on the flames of this escalating cycle of violence,' said British Ambassador Barbara Woodward. Iran’s foreign minister requested the Security Council meet in an emergency session following an early Saturday wave of airstrikes by Israel that struck missile factories in three Iranian provinces. Council members Algeria, China and Russia supported Tehran’s request. 'Now West Jerusalem is trying to involve Iran in confrontation -- Iran, which is showing unprecedented restraint under the circumstances,' Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, referring to Israel. Russia is a close ally of Iran. 'It is very difficult not to have the impression that West Jerusalem is intentionally raising tensions, despite the signals from Tehran that they are ready to refrain from further spiraling confrontation,' he added, referring to Israel. 'It is our view that such aggressive actions on the part of Israel are aimed at further stoking the flames of war, are unacceptable and need to stop.' Israel’s strikes came weeks after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel amid Israel’s wars with Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the Israeli strikes 'should not be exaggerated nor downplayed,' while stopping short of calling for retaliation. It was Israel's first open attack on its archenemy’s territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the attacks achieved Israel’s goals, including harming Iran’s defense capabilities and its ability to produce missiles. His envoy told the Security Council that Israel’s response was 'measured and proportionate,' but warned of stiff consequences if provoked again. 'To Iran’s leaders, take this as a warning: Israel has shown restraint. But from here on, you will see only strength,' Danny Danon said. 'Any further aggression will be met with consequences that are swift and decisive.' Iran’s envoy accused Israel of violating international law and the U.N. Charter and said Washington’s support had emboldened it to attack its neighbors. 'Regrettably, unwavering and unconditional support provided by the United States to Israel, coupled with its obstruction of the Security Council mandate as a permanent member, has emboldened Israel to persist in its crimes and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon, and now against Iran, gravely undermining regional peace and security,' said Amir Saeed Iravani. He urged the Security Council to respond with 'firm and dissolute action' and condemn Israel’s actions. U.S. envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Washington does not want to see further escalation and she delivered messages to both parties. 'Today, the United States’ message for Israel remains clear: We will always help secure its people and territory from Iran and its terrorist proxies and partners,' she said. 'Our message for Iran remains clear, as well: Should it choose to undertake further aggressive acts against Israel or U.S. personnel in the region, there will be severe consequences. We will not hesitate to act in self-defense.' Egyptian proposal Israeli forces carried out fresh airstrikes Monday in southern Lebanon where health officials said at least five people were killed in the city of Tyre and 10 were killed in the eastern Baalbek governorate. Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday proposed a two-day cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that would include the militant group freeing four hostages during the halt in fighting. Neither Israel nor Hamas offered any immediate response to el-Sissi’s plan, the first he has proposed during months of playing a role, along with the United States and Qatar, in trying to broker a halt to fighting. Israel said Monday that David Barnea, the head of the Mossad spy agency, had returned from talks in Doha with his U.S. CIA counterpart, William Burns, and the Qatari premier, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, where they discussed a new 'framework' for a Gaza hostage release deal. 'During the meeting, the parties discussed a new unified framework that combines previous proposals and also takes into account key issues and recent developments in the region,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. 'In the coming days, discussions will continue between the mediators and Hamas to assess the feasibility of talks and to further efforts to promote a deal.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters Monday, 'We need a cease-fire. This war should end.' Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terror groups. Separately, the Israeli parliament passed legislation Monday banning the main U.N. aid agency assisting the Palestinians, UNRWA. The law will go into effect in 90 days. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement that the bill 'sets a dangerous precedent.' 'It opposes the U.N. Charter and violates the state of Israel’s obligations under international law,' he wrote on social media platform X. 'This is the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role towards providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine Refugees.' Israel has accused dozens of UNRWA staffers of being members of Hamas and some of participating in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. UNRWA says it has taken action against about a dozen employees that Israel provided evidence about regarding their involvement with the terror group. However, in dozens of other cases, UNRWA has received either insufficient or no evidence from Israeli authorities. The latest conflict in the region began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, with Israel saying the death toll includes thousands of militants.

France, Morocco announce major investments as Macron visits Rabat	RABAT, Morocco — Morocco's King Mohammed VI welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron to Morocco on Monday, kicking off a state visit with a series of bilateral agreements, including major investments in renewable energy and transportation. Macron's trip to Morocco — his first in six years — comes as immigrants, including North Africans, face continued scrutiny in France and while France reassesses its role in its former colonies throughout Africa. Morocco has historically been a key economic and security partner, but relations between the two countries have often been fragile. Among the objectives of Macron's visit, the Elysee Palace said, is 'to rebuild the exceptional partnership that links our two countries.' French and Moroccan flags on Monday flew throughout the capital, where crowds lined the streets to watch the motorcade containing Macron, his wife and members of Morocco's royal family drive to one of their palaces. Macron and Mohammed VI, who used a cane to walk, later oversaw a ceremonial signing of 22 agreements to facilitate future investments as well as cultural and scientific partnerships. The investments are worth a total of 10 billion euros and include expanding Morocco's high-speed rail line southward to Marrakech, which the country hopes to complete before it holds events for the FIFA World Cup in 2030. Also included were plans to develop green hydrogen, wind farms and water projects, which Morocco has identified as needed to help insulate the country from the effects of climate change. In the days leading up to the visit, Moroccan publications lauded the 'warm reunion' and a 'new honeymoon' between the two countries. Warmer ties Macron changed France’s long-standing public position and backed Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara. Doing so endeared France to Morocco but alienated it from Algeria, which hosts refugee camps governed by the pro-independence Polisario Front and considers Morocco an occupying power. France and Morocco have historically partnered on issues ranging from counterterrorism to migration. Morocco is the top destination for French investment in Africa and France is Morocco’s top trade partner. Morocco imports French cereals, weapons and renewable energy infrastructure, like turbines. France imports goods from Morocco including tomatoes, cars and airplane parts. Moroccans are among the largest foreign-born communities in France, where North African immigrants are a key political constituency and a focal point of debates about the roles of Islam and immigration in French society. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, a member of the French delegation in Morocco this week, has pushed for the country to take a hard-line approach toward immigration and seek deals with countries like Morocco to better prevent would-be migrants from crossing into Europe. On Macron’s last visit to Morocco, he and King Mohammed VI inaugurated Al Boraq, Africa’s first high-speed rail line, made possible by French financing and trains manufactured by the French firm Alstrom. The rail line currently functions from central to northern Morocco, running from Kenitra to Tangiers. The extension will more than double its length. Despite close ties, relations have at times been fragile between France and Morocco, which was a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956. In 2021, Morocco suspended consular relations after France momentarily reduced the number of visas offered to Moroccans in protest of its refusal to provide documents needed to deport people who migrated to France without authorization. France later reversed the decision. Relations between the two countries soured further that year, when a 2021 report revealed Morocco’s security services had used Israeli spyware to infiltrate the devices of activists and politicians, including Macron. Morocco denied and sued over the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-morocco-announce-major-investments-as-macron-visits-rabat-/7842591.html	2024-10-28T16:21:55-07:00	
Ex-US Marine sentenced to 7 years for white supremacist plot	Washington — A former U.S. Marine was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday for his role in a white supremacist plot to destroy power facilities. Jordan Duncan, 29, pleaded guilty in North Carolina in June to aiding in the manufacture of a firearm. Duncan and four other men, including two other ex-Marines, were arrested in 2020 in connection with what authorities described as a neo-Nazi plot to sow chaos by targeting the power grid. 'We have now brought to justice all five of the defendants involved in a self-described 'modern day SS,' who conspired, prepared, and trained to attack America's power grid in the name of violent white supremacist ideology,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the group was 'inspired by racially motivated violent extremism.' 'If the defendants had been able to carry out an attack it could have caused suffering to thousands of American citizens,' Wray said. The other four defendants were previously sentenced to prison terms between 21 months and 10 years. According to court documents, two members of the group were active on 'Iron March,' a neo-Nazi online forum, until it was closed in 2017. They also recruited the other three people involved. The group accumulated firearms and produced a video of live-fire training in the desert near Boise, Idaho, that ended with the phrase 'Come home white man' as the final frame. Components of the power grid in the northwestern United States were listed as potential targets in handwritten notes found in the possession of one of the conspirators.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-us-marine-sentenced-to-7-years-for-white-supremacist-plot/7842572.html	2024-10-28T16:20:45-07:00	
One person dead in Iowa from Lassa fever, state health department says	The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed the death of a middle-aged eastern Iowa resident from Lassa fever. The individual had recently returned from travel to West Africa, where it is believed the person contracted the virus, the state health department said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to confirm the diagnosis of Lassa fever, the state health department said. The CDC said it assesses the risk to the general public to be extremely low. Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen in the United States. There have been eight travel-associated cases of Lassa fever in the United States in the past 55 years, according to the Iowa health department. In West Africa, the Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents. About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5,000 related deaths occur in West Africa each year, according to the CDC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-person-dead-in-iowa-from-lassa-fever-state-health-department-says-/7842584.html	2024-10-28T16:15:31-07:00	
Milei's popularity rebounds as Argentina's markets hit record highs	BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's President Javier Milei saw his popularity ratings rebound sharply in October, a poll on Monday showed, bolstering the libertarian whose pro-market reforms have driven markets to record highs since winning a shock election last year. A closely watched poll from the local Torcuato Di Tella University showed Milei's approval rating jump 12% after it slid in September because of tensions around pension reforms. The South American grains producer is battling triple-digit inflation and a recession, but former pundit Milei has managed to boost confidence in markets with tough spending cuts while largely keeping voters onside with his straight-talking style. Inflation, still in triple digits on an annual basis, has come down sharply each month, foreign currency reserve levels are being rebuilt and his government has turned around a deep fiscal deficit. Poverty levels, however, have risen sharply. A separate survey from consultancy Aresco showed the approval rating of Milei's government bouncing to 52.5% in October from 49.6% a month before, which it attributed to improving economic indicators. Milei, a political outsider, is riding a wave of voter anger with the main political parties after years of economic crises, despite a tough economic background and painful austerity measures he has pushed to try to boost the nation's finances. His government's non-negotiable zero deficit plan has gained huge cheers from markets, boosting bonds and stocks, while a tight monetary policy has also tamped down inflation and reduced a wide gap between official and parallel exchange rates. On Monday bonds jumped further away from distressed territory, where they had languished in recent years, rising on average 1.2%. Meanwhile, a key J.P. Morgan risk index of the country's debt hit its lowest level since mid-2019. 'The BCRA [central bank] buying reserves, new loans from international organizations, and high-frequency indicators showing October inflation at 3% were key to the fall in country risk,' said Roberto Geretto of AdCap Grupo Financiero. Andres Vernengo of consultancy CMA said Milei was, against the odds, making the market happy. Fears about further potential sovereign debt defaults were receding. 'Just when it seemed local assets were beginning to falter ... more rabbits appeared out of the hat,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/milei-s-popularity-rebounds-as-argentina-s-markets-hit-record-highs/7842577.html	2024-10-28T16:10:22-07:00	
UN body says Vietnam is unlawfully detaining journalist	Washington — A United Nations working group has found that a VOA contributing journalist imprisoned by Vietnam was arbitrarily detained prior to sentencing and incarceration. Pham Chi Dung was arrested in November 2019 and is serving a 15-year prison term for sharing what Vietnam calls 'anti-state propaganda.' The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention earlier in October adopted an opinion that Pham’s 'deprivation of liberty lacks a legal basis' and his 'detention resulted from his exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression.' The 58-year-old journalist is being held in a prison in Dong Nai province. Pham, a contributor to VOA Vietnamese, is also the founder and head of the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam, or IJAVN. The group advocates for democracy, freedom of the press and expression, and against corruption in Vietnam. In the indictment against Pham, authorities described the IJAVN as 'illegal.' The journalist’s lawyer, Kurtulus Bastimar, welcomed the U.N. working group’s opinion. 'The U.N. has decided that fundamental rights and freedom of [Pham have] been violated. For example, he was not allowed to communicate with his lawyers and with his family,' Bastimar, who filed his case to the working group, told VOA. Based in Turkey, Bastimar is an international lawyer who specializes in human rights and arbitrary detention. The U.N. working group also found that the journalist’s detention violates Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Bastimar said. Both guarantee freedom of expression. 'The arrest and the detention was due to the fact that he was exercising his right to freedom of expression, and because of his being a journalist or journalist-related works,' the lawyer said. VOA Director Mike Abramowitz said that the broadcaster stands with its contributor. 'For decades, Voice of America has acted on a clear mission to deliver fact-based information to people in unfree, closed societies and protect press freedom worldwide. VOA stands with Vietnamese journalist and VOA contributor Pham Chi Dung and denounces his unjust imprisonment after exercising his right to free speech,' Abramowitz said in a statement. A copy of the U.N. working group opinion shared with VOA recommended that Pham be freed immediately and that a full and independent investigation be held into the circumstances of his detention. Before adopting the opinion, the working group requested comment from the Vietnamese government. The request, which gives the government 60 days to respond, was sent on March 12. To date, the authorities have not responded. In response to a 2021 request from the U.N., however, the government said that the cases of Pham and Nguyen Tuong Thuy, who contributes to VOA sister network Radio Free Asia, 'were prosecuted due to their activities which violated Vietnamese law, not for the exercise of their fundamental freedoms.' Neither the Vietnamese embassy in Washington nor its Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to VOA's request for comment. Journalist jailings Police arrested Pham at his home in Ho Chi Minh City on Nov. 21, 2019, and seized documents. He was accused of 'producing, possessing, and spreading anti-state information and documents' and disseminating 'distorted information,' according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. A court convicted him during a one-day trial in January 2021. Vietnam has a poor record for media freedom and jailings of journalists. Pham is one of 19 journalists detained in late 2023, when CPJ released its latest census of media workers imprisoned for their work. The country ranks 174 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 denotes the best environment for press freedom. The U.N. has ruled that Vietnam should stop persecuting people over their right to freedom of expression, said Bastimar, who has defended other imprisoned journalists in Vietnam. 'In each and every case, the government has used the penal code or propaganda grounds to restrict or to violate the right to freedom of expression,' he said. In its opinion, the U.N. working group referenced the high number of cases in Vietnam. 'The present case is one of a number of cases brought before the working group in recent years concerning the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of persons, in particular human rights defenders, in Vietnam,' the opinion said. The working group said that the cases follow a pattern of arrest that does not comply with international norms, including lengthy pretrial detention with no access to judicial review; denial of or limited access to legal counsel; people held incommunicado; brief trials held behind closed doors. It added that prosecutions are often under vaguely worded criminal offenses for the peaceful exercise of human rights. 'The working group is concerned that this pattern indicates a systemic problem with arbitrary detention in Vietnam, which, if it continues, may amount to a serious violation of international law,' the U.N. group said.

Bogus bomb threats torment Indian aviation industry	Ahead of the busiest annual travel season in India, more than 400 hoax bomb threats have triggered domestic and international travel chaos during the past two weeks, with Indian airlines grounding and diverting planes and incurring huge financial losses. Some flights were escorted to safety by fighter jets as the unprecedented wave of bogus threats caused disruption to scores of flights and India’s air travel industry. The threats created panic among air passengers, authorities said. Heightened security measures were enforced at most airports shortly after the first spate of threats surfaced in the second week of October. Investigating agencies quickly began probes to trace and determine the sources. India’s junior civil aviation minister, Murlidhar Mohol, told local media that most of the hoax bomb threats originated from outside the country. 'Up to 80% of the threats this month came from abroad. Police in different states are investigating some threats that originated in India,' Mohol said on October 23. On October 17, police in Mumbai arrested a 17-year-old boy for allegedly posting bomb threats to four flights on X, formerly Twitter. Police also questioned another minor as a suspect in the cases of the threats to airlines, it was reported. On Saturday, a 25-year-old man was arrested in New Delhi for emailing hoax bomb threats to some Indian airlines and to Indira Gandhi International Airport. Fresh threats, however, continued to arrive largely via emails and through anonymous social media accounts on platforms like X and Meta, authorities said. On Sunday, fresh hoax bomb threats targeted at least 50 flights of Indian airlines. On Monday, threats affected more than 60 flights across multiple Indian airlines. Although Indian airlines like Air India, IndiGo, Spicejet and Vistara have been mostly targeted by the hoax threats, American Airlines and Air New Zealand have also received threats since the second week of October. Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu deemed the burst of economic harassment and threats a 'serious concern' even if the threats of violence seemed to be hoaxes. 'The safety and security of the people are the foremost aspect. … Those responsible for the threats would be identified and duly prosecuted,' Naidu said on October 21. The Indian government was planning to introduce stricter legislative measures to tackle the growing trend of bomb threats, including a law to categorize such threat-making as a criminal offense with the accused facing prosecution and the offenders being placed on no-fly lists, Naidu said. On Saturday, India sent a warning to social media platforms, including X, calling the spread of the threats 'dangerously unrestrained.' In a statement, Indian authorities warned the social media platforms of 'consequential action as provided under any law' if they do not comply with the 'prompt removal of misinformation.' 'The instances of malicious acts, in the form of hoax bomb threats to such airlines, lead to a potential threat to the public order and security of the state,' the statement said. 'Such hoax bomb threats, while affecting a large number of citizens, also destabilizes the economic security of the country.' Hoax bomb threats are not a new trend in India. In recent years, some airports and airlines have received similar bogus threats. But their frequency in the past two weeks has been unprecedented, leading to significant responses from authorities and investigators. The police have managed to trace only three persons in India who are accused of sending around a dozen such threats over the past two weeks. Investigators are yet to determine who sent more than 96% of this month’s threats. The investigators reported that by tracking IP addresses some of the threats appeared to have originated from Germany and the United Kingdom. Airlines, passengers suffer India’s aviation industry has been massively impacted by the bomb threats. Following international protocols, the airlines had to act on every threat. Dozens of international flights originating from India were diverted and some made emergency landings in third countries such as Canada, Germany or Turkey. Sanjay Lazar, an aviation professional and former Air India crew member, told VOA that protocol requires each bomb threat to be treated with the 'utmost seriousness.' He says the threats lead to financial losses and substantial inconveniences for airline companies and passengers. 'An aircraft on the ground is evacuated and taken to a remote bay, then the bomb squad checks it, security sanitizes it, and it takes three to four hours for an entire process to be completed. This costs money, both in man hours wasted and additional man hours and costs spent in the checks and more importantly, in the reduced utilization of the aircraft,' said Lazar, the CEO of Avialaz Consultants, an aviation consultancy firm. 'It also brings about wastage of pilots and crew duty time limits, which entails fresh crew in case of long delays. It also costs airlines by way of passenger meals and, in some cases, hotel accommodation.' Air India said that on October 15, its flight from New Delhi to Chicago with 211 passengers was forced to make an emergency landing in Iqaluit, a remote northern city in Canada, following a threat. A Canadian Air Force aircraft later transported the passengers to Chicago. On October 20, Afghanistan refused permission for an emergency landing to a Frankfurt-bound Vistara flight after it received a bomb threat. The flight had to return to India. In two separate incidents, around the middle of the month, authorities in the U.K. and Singapore had to send fighter jets to escort two Air India flights that had received bomb threats, authorities said. The investigators said that the motive behind the threats had yet to be determined. Lazar, the aviation expert, said the threats may be driven by a ‘’malicious intent’’ to invoke chaos and fear among persons traveling to and from India, and cause economic damage. 'The miscreants may want to create huge losses for airlines and inconveniences for the general public. Their actions would also show India in a poor light,' he said. Lazar described the threats as 'cyber terrorism,' and that the government needs to enforce laws 'to the fullest' to punish the perpetrators. 'India should ensure that, like the U.S., hoax bomb threats are treated as a federal offense, are investigated the way FBI does and causes mandatory jail time for those involved,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bogus-bomb-threats-torment-indian-aviation-industry/7842500.html	2024-10-28T15:13:32-07:00
