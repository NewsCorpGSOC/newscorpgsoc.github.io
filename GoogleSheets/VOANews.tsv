White House pushes for de-escalation in Mideast, warns North Korea for aiding Russia	The Biden administration continues to push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and de-escalation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In Europe, the administration has revealed intelligence that North Korean troops are being trained in Russia to help its war efforts. VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with White House national security communications adviser John Kirby on the latest developments in the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. VOA: [U.S.] Secretary [of State] Antony Blinken today warned Israel against a protracted campaign in Lebanon. He warned Israel to avoid civilian casualties, not to endanger U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army. The only way Israel can do that is by operating a targeted campaign. Is it operating a targeted campaign? White House national security communications adviser John Kirby: We would like to see no civilian casualties and no damage to civilian infrastructure to the maximum extent possible. We have told the Israelis that we don't support near daily strikes in densely populated areas, and that's part of the message that [Blinken] delivered when he was there. We believe that there's still a diplomatic path to be found here to bring this conflict with Hezbollah and Lebanon to a close. That was one of the reasons that Secretary Blinken traveled there. VOA: Do you support Israeli demands for an expanded U.N. peacekeeping force to include north of the Litani River? Kirby: I'm not going to get into any specific proposals one way or the other. I don't think we're at that point right now. … What we support is de-escalation. What we support is minimization of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. We also continue to support Israel's right to defend itself. VOA: What about Israel's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure in Lebanon? How far can you accept the cost of that? Kirby: Look, they have done an extraordinary amount of work towards already dismantling Hezbollah's capability, including the killing of [Hassan Nasrallah], their leader. Hezbollah is not Hamas. They are in many ways superior in terms of military capability and resources. So, it's a different kind of a fight. It's a different kind of enemy that they face. And I would remind that even just in the last 24 hours, more than 100 rockets and drones [were] launched by Hezbollah towards Israeli citizens who are just trying to live their lives on that side of the Blue Line, as well. So, it remains a viable threat to the Israeli people, and we're going to continue to talk to the Israelis about how they go after that threat, because how they do that matters significantly. VOA: Ten days ago, the administration set a 30-day deadline for Israel to improve Palestinian access to aid. Can you update us on the progress? Kirby: There has been some progress, and as you heard Secretary Blinken say during his travels, more needs to be done. But there has been an increase of trucks flowing into North Gaza; specifically, the Erez Crossing is back open. We want to see more. VOA: Israel announced that Mossad chief David Barnea will meet with CIA Director Bill Burns and the Qatari prime minister in Doha. Is there anything about that meeting that you can tell us? Kirby: Without talking to the CIA director's travel or meetings, I won't do that. But you saw the prime minister already announced that there's another meeting in Doha of negotiators, and we're grateful to see this progress continue. We're grateful to see yet another meeting here, and we're hopeful that now, with Mr. Sinwar gone, Hamas might be more willing to sit down and negotiate in good faith and come up with a solution that gets a cease-fire of at least some duration, and gets those hostages home with their families where they belong, as well as to your earlier question, gives us a pause in the fighting that can help us all work towards a more dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance. I'm not suggesting that more can't be done now. Even while Gaza remains an active combat zone, more can be done, more should be done. But if you can end the fighting, then you can definitely make it easier to get humanitarian assistance. VOA: Does the administration see [Yahya Sinwar's brother] Mohamed Sinwar as somebody with influence on the negotiations? Kirby: I think it's unclear right now where the leadership of Hamas goes, and I would just say that we're watching this very, very closely, as you might imagine, monitoring it. Regardless of how Hamas tries to fill the vacuum left by Sinwar, they have an opportunity before them right now to help end this war, to get those hostages home and to do the right thing. VOA: Let's move on to North Korea and Russia. [Russian President] Vladimir Putin appears to have implicitly acknowledged what you laid out yesterday, that North Korean troops are in Russia to help their war efforts. How do you see this? Kirby: We see it the same way as we laid out yesterday. We know that there are at least several thousand North Korean soldiers in three military training bases in eastern Russia. Now, exactly what they're being trained to do, we don't know. Whether and how they'll be deployed in this war against Ukraine, we don't know that either. But it is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that, I would remind you, Russia themselves signed up to. The procurement of arms and ammunition from North Korea is a violation of U.N. Security Council existing resolutions that Russia signed up to. We're going to watch this very, very closely. VOA: What is the geopolitical implication for Kim Jong Un now that he's willing to send his troops to die for Putin? Are you concerned that in return, Russia could help North Korea improve the reach of their ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles] to hit American cities, for example? Kirby: That's what we're watching closely to see. We don't know exactly what Mr. Kim thinks he's getting out of this arrangement. And it's worrisome. As you heard the secretary of defense say the other day, this potential move here by the North Koreans to put soldiers on the ground, literally skin in the game when it comes to fighting Ukraine, is not only going to have implications in Ukraine and on that battlefield, but it's going to have implications in the Indo-Pacific. What we don't know right now is exactly what that looks like. What does Kim think he's getting out of this? It is possible that there could be some provision by Russia to enhance and improve North Korean military capabilities? Again, that would just further destabilize a very tense region. VOA: You said these North Korean soldiers are legitimate military targets. But would you consider taking direct military action against them as the head of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Mike Turner, suggested? Kirby: The United States is not directly involved in combat operations in or around Ukraine. The president has been clear about that. We are providing Ukraine with the kinds of tools, capabilities and weapons that they need to defend themselves. And when we say they're legitimate military targets, these North Korean soldiers, we mean they would become legitimate military targets of the Ukrainian Armed Forces should they be involved in operations against Ukraine. VOA: China has said that they have no information on these North Korean troops. Do you believe them? Kirby: I'll let the Chinese speak to what they see or they don't see. What I said yesterday stands today. We're going to certainly be communicating with our PRC [People's Republic of China] counterparts about this. VOA: Last month you also confirmed that Iran transferred shipments of domestic missiles to Russia. Now we have these North Korean troops fighting for Russia. What is your assessment of this trilateral cooperation? Kirby: Number one, it certainly shows Mr. Putin's increasing desperation, and quite frankly, his weakness, that he has to reach out to the likes of Kim Jong Un and the supreme leader in Tehran for assistance to fight Ukraine. Clearly, he's under a lot of military pressure. We know he's losing 1,200 soldiers a day. He suffered more than 530,000 casualties in the time he's been fighting in Ukraine. So, he's clearly under pressure, and he's not ... being honest with the Russian people about what he's doing and what he's losing and how bloody and lethal this war has been on his own armed forces. Number two, I think it certainly speaks to worrisome defense relationships between these countries that are now growing and deepening. They're worrying not just because of what might be the effects in Ukraine, they're worrying because of what might be the effects in other parts of the world. You and I were just talking about what Kim Jong Un might be getting out of this. Let's talk about Iran, because Iran, certainly we know, is interested in advanced aviation capabilities, for instance, from Russia. Now, again, I don't know that we've seen it all consummated yet, but Iran being able to benefit from Russian military technology is also not good for the Middle East region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-pushes-for-de-escalation-in-mideast-warns-north-korea-for-aiding-russia/7838604.html	2024-10-24T19:23:49-07:00	
Ship owner, manager in US bridge collapse agree to pay $102M for cleanup	washington — The owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the deadly Baltimore bridge collapse have agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department, officials said Thursday. The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge, officials said in a news release announcing the agreement. That construction project could cost close to $2 billion. The state of Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among others. The settlement comes a month after the Justice Department sued the ship's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and manager, Synergy Marine Group, both based in Singapore, seeking to recover funds from the cleanup. The Justice Department alleged that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six men on a road crew, who were filling potholes during an overnight shift, fell to their deaths. Cleanup crews worked around the clock searching for bodies and removing thousands of tons of mangled steel and smashed concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River. The Dali remained stuck amid the wreckage for almost two months, with collapsed steel trusses draped across the ship's damaged bow. 'This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government's cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer,' Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said in a statement. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore and put many local longshoremen out of work before the channel was fully opened in June. It interrupted East Coast shipping routes as the port is one of the busiest in the country, especially for cars and farm equipment. Grace Ocean and Synergy filed a court petition just days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Court records show attorneys for both parties said in a joint filing Thursday that they had reached a settlement agreement and requested dismissal of the Justice Department's claim, which sought $103 million in cleanup costs. The claim is one of many filed in an expansive liability case that will ultimately determine how much the ship's owner and manager will owe for their role in causing the disaster. The other claims are still unresolved. They've been filed on behalf of the victims' families, companies whose business has suffered as a result of the collapse, municipal entities and more.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ship-owner-manager-in-us-bridge-collapse-agree-to-pay-102m-for-cleanup-/7838589.html	2024-10-24T18:51:31-07:00	
Blinken shuttles around Mideast on peace quest	washington — Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with key negotiators Thursday during a frenetic four-day exercise in Middle East shuttle diplomacy that aims to relaunch talks to pull the grinding war in Gaza to a close. On Thursday, he announced $135 million in additional U.S. aid for Palestinian civilians. He also reiterated President Joe Biden's stance that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week by Israeli forces was a reasonable stopping point to this brutal conflict sparked on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed the Israeli border, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. 'Israel has accomplished the strategic goals that it set out for itself: making sure that October 7th and the horrors can never happen again by effectively dismantling the military organization of Hamas,' Blinken said, speaking from Doha, Qatar. 'It has succeeded in doing that and bringing to justice its leaders, those who perpetrated the horrors of October 7th, notably Sinwar,' he added. 'Now that that's been accomplished, this is a moment to work to end this war, to make sure all the hostages are home and to build a better future for people in Gaza.' Qatar's leader and top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who serves as both prime minister and foreign minister, appeared with Blinken. He said negotiators had reengaged with Hamas. But he went on to paint a murky picture of the future. 'Regarding our communication with Hamas and the leadership after Sinwar — yes, we reengaged with them,' he said. 'We've been in an engagement with representatives from the political office in Doha. We had some meetings with them the last couple of days. I believe that until now, there is no clarity what will be the way forward or the clear position.' Not much optimism Analysts aren't hopeful that this fire can be doused, especially after Israel began targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing its leader. The U.S. considers Hezbollah and Hamas terrorist organizations. 'To be entirely honest, it's not entirely clear why Tony Blinken is making another trip to the region,' said Gerald Feierstein, director of the Arabian Peninsula Affairs Program at the Middle East Institute. 'There doesn't seem to be any particular prospect that he's going to achieve anything new or different than the last 10 times that he's been out there,' he told VOA. A top U.S. Muslim rights advocacy group pointed to what he said were two stumbling blocks to a deal: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's top supporter, Biden. 'Mr. Netanyahu, for political and ideological reasons, has no interest in agreeing to a permanent cease-fire that frees all the hostages, pulls all Israeli troops out of Gaza and ends the war once and for all,' Edward Ahmed Mitchell, deputy director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told VOA. 'The only way to force him to do it is to withhold the weapons. So, I do not expect Mr. Blinken's trip to succeed without that missing element.' These delicate diplomatic moves are happening well over the heads of the people who have to live through this on both sides of this bristling border. On Thursday in central Gaza, at least 17 Palestinians — among them, children — were killed in an Israeli strike on a school where displaced people were taking shelter. And on Thursday in Jerusalem, hundreds of protesters marched to demand the release of Israeli hostages who were abducted on October 7, 2023. VOA's Kim Lewis contributed to this report from Washington.

G7 is finalizing $50B loan to Ukraine	A $50 billion loan to Ukraine from the G7 major industrialized nations is moving forward after months of negotiations, with countries announcing their contributions to the package this week. The loan package is aimed at providing Ukraine with an economic lifeline from $280 billion worth of Russian assets frozen since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. According to the plan, the loan will be repaid with interest accumulating on the frozen Russian assets rather than confiscating the frozen assets themselves. This 'creative' solution is intended to provide Ukraine with the economic assistance it urgently needs 'without burdening American taxpayers,' U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement, adding that 'these loans will support the people of Ukraine as they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear: Tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.' 'This will really support us,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement thanking allies for the decision. The United States will contribute $20 billion to the loan, while Canada and Britain announced contributions of $3.7 billion and $2.94 billion, respectively. The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a European Union decision to provide up to $38 billion as part of the loan. While the details of the loan are still being worked out, donors announced the funding will cover Ukraine’s economic and defense needs. U.S. deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh told reporters if the U.S. Congress approves the loan contribution, the Biden administration plans to allocate half of the $20 billion to support Ukraine’s economy and the other half for defense support. The United Kingdom's $2.94 billion is to be used solely for Ukraine’s military, British Defense Minister John Healey announced this week. 'With this decision, Ukraine is confident that it will have money to fully fund the critically important expenditures next year, including wages to teachers, doctors, pensions,' Roman Kachur, alternate executive director for Ukraine at the World Bank, told VOA. According to the International Monetary Fund, the loan is crucial if Ukraine is to meet its financing needs. 'We have talked with [the] Ukrainian government about the ways to close the financing gap, which has opened up because the war takes longer than everybody expected and therefore more budget financing will be needed,' Alfred Kammer, director of the IMF’s European Department, told VOA. The fund, which has a four-year program for Ukraine, expects the multiyear financing through the loan will help the country cover a financing gap that now exceeds $150 billion, Kammer added. Washington economist Anders Aslund called the loan plan 'excellent,' posting on X: 'Finally, Ukraine is about to get relevant financial support.' The G7 decision has been criticized for falling short of an outright seizure of the frozen Russian assets. 'I don’t think we should be celebrating this as Ukraine is not going to get the underlying $330bn,' economist Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management said in an email to VOA. Ash blamed 'the vested interests in Europe' for blocking a decision to seize the assets. The plan to divide funding from the loan between economic and military support worries some observers in Ukraine. 'Previously, the discussion was that the funding will go to fund economic stability. Now, we are under the impression that the funding will also be used for defense support,' Oleksandra Betliy, chief researcher at the Institute of Economic Research in Kyiv, told VOA. 'This is fine for the next year, where the budget deficit is $38 billion, but the issue is with the 2026 budget.' She added that Ukraine’s funding needs will remain high for years to come. 'Even if 2026 will be victorious, we will further need to fund the military for it to be strong, and social payments will be even higher than today,' she said. To ensure transparency and accountability, funding from the loan will be distributed via an intermediary fund set up by the World Bank, which according to Singh is 'subject to robust accountability and transparency measures.' Kachur agreed, saying the World Bank’s control over the funding will eliminate any perception of misuse. In addition, according to Ukrainian officials, the money will not be repurposed once it is in the World Bank’s fund. 'Even if there is a change in the political will, this funding will still remain available to Ukraine and will be transferred only to Ukraine,' Kachur said. The details of the loan package have not yet been finalized. G7 finance ministers plan to discuss the loan on the margins of this week’s annual IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-is-finalizing-50-billion-loan-to-ukraine/7838231.html	2024-10-24T16:56:27-07:00	
Putin tells BRICS leaders that Middle East on brink of full-scale war	kazan, russia — Russian President Vladimir Putin told BRICS leaders on Thursday that the Middle East was on the brink of a full-scale war after a sharp rise in tension between Israel and Iran, though the Kremlin chief also faced calls to end the war in Ukraine. The BRICS summit, attended by more than 20 leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan, has shown the depth of Russia's relations beyond the Western world. Much discussion at the summit in the Russian city of Kazan was dedicated to the war in Ukraine and the violence in the Middle East, though there were no sign that anything specific would be done to end either conflict. 'The degree of confrontation between Israel and Iran has sharply increased. All this resembles a chain reaction and puts the entire Middle East on the brink of a full-scale war,' Putin, sitting beside Chinese President Xi Jinping, said. Xi, speaking after Putin, said that China wanted a political settlement in Ukraine, and suggested joint efforts by Beijing and Brasilia offered the best chance of peace. 'We need to work for an early de-escalation of the situation and pave the way for a political settlement,' Xi said. On the Middle East, Xi said that there should be a comprehensive cease-fire in Gaza, a halt to the spread of war in Lebanon, and a return to the two-state solution under which states for both Israel and Palestine would be established. Flames of war Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian criticized international organizations, particularly the United Nations, for failing to end the conflict. 'The flames of war continue to rage in the Gaza Strip and cities of Lebanon, and international institutions, particularly the U.N. Security Council as a driver of international peace and security, lack the necessary effectiveness to extinguish the fire of this crisis,' Pezeshkian told the BRICS. Putin said that unless Palestinians got their state, they would feel the burden of 'historical injustice' and the region would remain in 'an atmosphere of permanent crisis with inevitable relapses of large-scale violence.' In their summit declaration, BRICS leaders called for the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state within the borders of 1967. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attended the summit. At one of the BRICS+ meetings on Thursday, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar sat in for Modi who also missed one of the group photographs. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he could not travel to Russia due to a head injury. China, which together with India buys about 90% of Russia's oil, supported more Global South countries joining the BRICS grouping in various formats, Xi said. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who was criticized by Kyiv for attending the meeting in Russia, said peace was needed in Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan and Ukraine. 'We need peace in Ukraine,' Guterres told the BRICS+ meeting that was chaired by Putin. 'A just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and U.N. General Assembly resolutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-tells-brics-leaders-that-middle-east-on-brink-of-full-scale-war/7838163.html	2024-10-24T15:04:28-07:00	
Iran's Pezeshkian slams UN failure to 'extinguish' regional crisis	Kazan, Russia — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday condemned the 15-nation U.N. Security Council for failing to tackle the Middle East conflict. 'The fire of war is still raging in the Palestinian Gaza Strip and Lebanese cities,' Pezeshkian told leaders from emerging economies at the BRICS summit in Russia. 'And international institutions ... topped by the United Nations Security Council — who are drivers of international peace and security — lack the necessary efficiency to extinguish the fire of this crisis.' Pezeshkian condemned Israel for violating 'the red lines' of different states and 'producing a new wave of violence and terror.' Since the start of the war in Gaza, the Islamic republic has criticized the U.N. body for being inactive and ineffective in ending conflict in the Middle East. Iran is engaged in an intense diplomatic campaign to establish cease-fires in both Gaza and Lebanon. The efforts are also aimed at preventing the conflict from expanding across the region after Israel's threat to retaliate to an attack by Iran on October 1. Tehran said the attack was in response to Israeli strikes in Lebanon, which killed an Iranian general and the head of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, Hassan Nasrallah, late September. Iran supports Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas, whose militant groups are fighting Israel. 'Defeating its purpose' For his part, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Esmaeil Baghaei, turned to social media to criticize the U.N. for turning 'into a frustratingly dysfunctional platform.' He said the U.N. was 'sadly defeating its purpose' because the United States' 'unconditional support for [the] occupying regime' — Israel — 'has so emboldened the regime as to expand its aggressions and atrocities across the region,' he posted on social media platform X. The U.S. is one of the five permanent Security Council members with powers to block its decisions. Earlier in October, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi accused the United States of obstructing the Security Council over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. '[The] inaction of the U.N. Security Council due to the obstruction of the United States [is] a disaster,' he said. Iran does not recognize the state of Israel and has made support for Palestinian cause one of the pillars of its foreign policy since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The Security Council is composed of five permanent members with veto powers - China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. — and 10 nonpermanent members elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. The current nonpermanent members are Algeria, Ecuador, Guyana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Switzerland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-pezeshkian-slams-un-failure-to-extinguish-regional-crisis/7838162.html	2024-10-24T14:35:18-07:00	
Biden administration approves Nevada lithium mine	The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday gave final approval to ioneer's Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine in Nevada, the first domestic source of the battery metal to be permitted by President Joe Biden's administration and one that will become a key supplier to Ford and other electric vehicle manufacturers. Shares of the Australia-based critical minerals miner jumped more than 20% in New York trading on Thursday afternoon before easing down. The approval ends a more-than six-year review process during which regulators, ioneer and conservationists tussled over the fate of a rare flower found at the mine site, a tension that exposed the sometimes competing priorities between climate change mitigation efforts and biodiversity protection. The permit, which had been expected by the end of the year, comes amid a flurry of recent moves by Biden officials to support critical minerals production and offset China's market dominance. It also unlocks a $700 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, as well as a $490 million equity investment from Sibanye Stillwater to fund the project. 'This is a science-based decision,' Laura Daniel-Davis, the Interior Department's acting deputy secretary, told Reuters. 'We're trying to send a signal that there's no topic with greater importance than addressing climate change.' The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which is controlled by the Interior Department, on Thursday issued the Rhyolite Ridge project's record of decision — essentially the mine's permit — and said the project will 'include significant protections for the local ecosystem' and help create hundreds of jobs in the rural region. The project, roughly 362 kilometers north of Las Vegas, Nevada, contains enough lithium to power roughly 370,000 electric vehicles each year. Construction is slated to begin next year, with production commencing by 2028, a timeline that would make Rhyolite Ridge one of the largest U.S. lithium producers alongside Albemarle and Lithium Americas. The U.S. Geological Survey has labeled lithium a critical mineral vital for the U.S. economy and national security. 'We're proud to be the first U.S. lithium mine permitted by the Biden administration,' James Calaway, ioneer's chairman, told Reuters. The project will extract lithium as well as boron, a chemical used to make ceramics and soaps, from a clay-like deposit. The lithium will be processed on site into two main derivatives used to make batteries, and the company said it plans to recycle half of all the water used at the site, higher than the industry average. Ford and a joint venture between Toyota and Panasonic have agreed to buy lithium from the mine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-approves-nevada-lithium-mine-/7838129.html	2024-10-24T14:25:14-07:00	
Georgia’s parliamentary vote poses choice between West, East	Tbilisi, Georgia — With Georgia set to hold parliamentary elections Saturday, Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi’s main thoroughfare, was filled with buses and minibuses Wednesday evening, transporting supporters of the ruling Georgian Dream party from across the country. The rally drew an estimated 150,000 people, largely composed of regional government employees. Rally attendees interviewed by Voice of America’s Georgian Service echoed the ruling party's talking points, including the claim that Georgia is being dragged into the Russia-Ukraine war and the alleged influence of foreign agents on Georgian politics. 'I'm here because I want my homeland to survive,' said one government supporter. 'I came because I want this country to be led by a patriotic party, not by agents of America,' said another participant. 'America is now pushing an LGBT agenda — it's become a pseudo-liberal state,' said a third rally attendee, Omar, repeating rhetoric frequently heard from Georgian Dream. Opposition rally The pro-government rally followed an opposition demonstration held Sunday, when thousands were in the streets of Tbilisi for a 'European March' supporting closer ties with the West. Participants in that march told VOA they saw it as a way to resist a slide back under Russian influence for the country. 'For me, Georgia's European future is important — to be a democratic country, tolerant, free and advanced, with Western friends,' said Tiko Nadirashvili. 'This is the choice of the Georgian people.' 'I am here to show my friends that we are winning this, because the [ruling] Georgian Dream [party] already knows it’s losing,' another attendee told VOA. Georgia’s opposition is made up of four key forces. At the forefront is the United National Movement, or UNM, accompanied by its splinter group, the Coalition for Change. The other major players include the Strong Georgia coalition and For Georgia, led by former Georgian Dream Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia. The opposition’s electoral campaign has focused on the theme of European integration, warning against threats to Georgia’s Western aspirations. While it has highlighted economic issues, critics argue that its rhetoric often veers toward populism and lacks substantial policy proposals. For its part, Georgian Dream’s election campaign has framed its opponents inside Georgia and critics among Western governments as a 'global war party' conspiring to pull Georgia into the Russia-Ukraine conflict — a conspiracy theory crafted to exploit fears of another war. Russians remain Georgia, which has faced two conflicts with Russia since the 1990s, still lives with Russian troops occupying 20% of its territory. 'Georgian Dream relies on the narrative that without them, there will be Russian bombs and war, and that they are the only ones maintaining peace,' said Levan Ramishvili, a professor at Tbilisi's Free University. 'This perception of a weakened West fuels anti-liberal forces within countries like Georgia and elsewhere.' 'It's not disinformation that has caused these attitudes, but rather the yearslong war in Ukraine with no clear end in sight,' Ramishvili added. 'There's no clear vision from the West, be it from the Biden administration or the Republicans. 'This lack of clarity makes the perception of a weakened West more pervasive, with leaders like [Georgian Dream founder and former Prime Minister Bidzina] Ivanishvili confidently stating that they will simply endure, and the West will eventually cave.' Georgian Dream, seeking to hold on to power for a fourth term, has put up posters across the country juxtaposing images of war-torn Ukrainian cities with peaceful Georgian landscapes, accompanied by the slogans 'No to war' and 'Choose peace.' The implication is clear: A vote against Georgian Dream is a vote for war. 'Georgian Dream is trying to frame this election as a choice between war and peace, rather than between the West and Russia,' said Shota Utiashvili of the Rondeli Foundation, a Tbilisi think tank. 'The entire election campaign is centered around cultivating a culture of fear — fear of war, fear of difference, fear of modernization and fear of the West.' The ruling party's tactics also extend to cultural identity. Georgian Dream has enacted legislation targeting 'LGBT propaganda,' arguing that it protects Georgia's traditional values from Western influence. By aligning with the powerful Georgian Orthodox Church and conservative, pro-Russian groups, the government positions itself as the defender of tradition. 'Georgian Dream has essentially replicated Russia’s homophobic legislation — not only copied its content, but also deployed similar propaganda tactics to sway conservative voters and influence election outcomes,' said Giorgi Tabagari, a gay rights activist. 'None of the issues addressed in the legislation reflect the actual priorities of Georgian voters,' he added. 'Some of the homophobic narratives that Georgian Dream has been using throughout the election campaign are rather out of touch with Georgian reality and mirror cultural debates in the West without any local context.' Critics compare Georgian Dream's tactics to those of the Kremlin. Earlier this year, Georgian Dream passed a controversial 'foreign agent' law, requiring nongovernmental organizations and media outlets receiving foreign funding to register as 'agents of foreign influence.' Critics say this law mirrors Russian tactics to suppress dissent and bring civil society under tighter government control. The law’s passage sparked mass protests, which were met by government crackdowns, which drew Western condemnation and U.S. sanctions on several Georgian officials. 'There has been a surge in anti-Western and Euroskeptic narratives, which were previously spread by anonymous actors but are now being openly promoted by the ruling party,' said Nino Dolidze, who heads the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, or ISFED, a Georgian NGO. 'At the same time, we are witnessing a broader anti-Western narrative, accompanied by increased interference from Russia in Georgia's information space,' she said. 'This includes public statements from Russian leaders and coordinated disinformation efforts on social networks, driven by Russian accounts, trolls and bots.' Voter fears According to Dolidze, the parliamentary election campaign has been marred by allegations of voter intimidation, vote-buying and misuse of state resources. Georgian Dream proxies reportedly have threatened legal consequences for those who vote for the opposition. Many Georgians, particularly those in rural areas reliant on public sector jobs or social assistance, fear losing their livelihoods if they don’t back the ruling party. 'They are telling us that they are frightened and afraid of losing income. Of course, it is creating problems in terms of a free vote, as you can imagine how it affects the free will of voters,' Dolidze said. Speaking with VOA at Wednesday’s pro-government rally in Tbilisi, Archil Talakvadze, a member of the Georgian Dream faction in the country’s parliament, said that, given Russia’s occupation of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Georgian people 'have done their utmost to support Ukraine' and 'stand firmly in favor of genuine peace.' Georgia’s opposition, he said, 'lacks faith' in winning through democratic elections, 'leading them to discredit the electoral process and use any opportunity to destabilize the country.' 'We will not allow any risks that could drag Georgia into another war, where our soldiers and civilians could lose their lives in an unequal fight,' Talakvadze told VOA. 'Instead, we will protect the future of our country through peace, security and European integration.' While Georgian Dream promotes itself as the only guarantor of peace, the opposition argues that a Georgian Dream election win would be a victory for Russia, and it insists the ruling party will not prevail. 'Georgian Dream will not be able to subvert the voice of Georgian people at the ballot box through false constructs on war and peace that are based entirely on Russian propaganda narratives,' Tina Bokuchava, head of the United National Movement party, told VOA. The opposition, however, remains disconnected from voters. Polls show that 61% of Georgians feel none of the existing political parties represent them, and 72% want new political actors. Still, many observers say Georgians see the election as a chance to vote against the ruling party, not for the opposition. 'In reality, [if it loses] Georgian Dream will defeat themselves; it won't be the opposition that brings them down,' said Ramishvili of Tbilisi's Free University. 'Georgian Dream will commit political suicide, because in Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment is a part of our national identity, along with European and pro-Western views. As a result, when Georgian Dream openly launched an anti-Western campaign, they lost the support of voters who want both peace and Europe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-parliamentary-vote-poses-choice-between-west-east/7838136.html	2024-10-24T14:23:12-07:00	
More than 10,000 Haitians flee gang attacks in past week, UN says	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — More than 10,000 people in Haiti have been internally displaced in the last week as armed gangs operating in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, ramp up attacks on areas they do not yet control, according to U.N. migration agency estimates on Thursday. The agency had said at the start of September that more than 700,000 people were internally displaced across the Caribbean nation, nearly double the figure six months earlier. Gangs have in the last week been ramping up attacks on a number of towns outside the capital, where much of the city and its suburbs are under the control of various violent armed groups united under a common alliance known as Viv Ansanm. The conflict is fueling famine-level hunger in parts of the population as gangs take over farmlands and block off transport routes, while people forced to flee their homes — often to host families or makeshift camps — can no longer depend on steady income to afford food. While the United Nations authorized an international force to help Haiti's police take back control from the gangs, the mission has been poorly resourced and has produced scant results. Haiti's leadership has requested the force be converted to a formal peacekeeping mission to shore up resources, an initiative that was blocked last month by China and Russia. Gangs who previously targeted national police, civilian self-defense groups and state infrastructure also have begun targeting foreign vehicles. The U.S. Embassy in Haiti told Reuters that on Monday two of its armored vehicles had been targeted by gang gunfire. One was hit by multiple rounds, although no one was hurt or injured. A U.N. helicopter with 18 people on board was also shot at and hit with multiple rounds on Thursday, although no one was injured, the Miami Herald reported. The U.N.'s Haiti office did not immediately respond to a request for more information.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-10-000-haitians-flee-gang-attacks-in-past-week-un-says/7838133.html	2024-10-24T14:10:23-07:00	
How Afghan, Pakistani clerics battle polio vaccine misinformation	Maulana Tayyab Qureshi, the top cleric in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, has seen up close the devastating effects of polio. Two of his own kin were once paralyzed, victims of a scourge that has been vanquished worldwide yet refuses to go away from Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. 'Had their parents not neglected [to have their children vaccinated], their children wouldn’t be disabled today,' Qureshi said of his relatives. As the chief khateeb, or Friday prayer leader, of the northwestern province, Qureshi preaches this message at every opportunity — Friday sermons at his 17th century Mahabat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, Eid prayers when upward of 40,000 people congregate, meetings with village elders. 'I’m very clear cut: I tell them, it’s free. It doesn’t cost you anything. Why don’t you take it seriously?' Qureshi said in an interview with VOA. Qureshi is not the only Pakistani cleric advocating vaccination. Several renowned scholars have issued decrees in its support, with a notable shift in attitudes. Vaccine hesitancy, an intractable obstacle to eradicating polio, has waned, he said. A once infamous bastion of vaccine resistance outside Peshawar has now embraced immunization. 'The fatwas have had a great impact,' Qureshi said. Yet, as Pakistan and Afghanistan seek to eradicate polio, misinformation remains a key hurdle. While immunization rates are generally high in both countries, pockets of resistance persist along the border, jeopardizing eradication efforts. To counter vaccine misinformation, public health officials increasingly have turned to influential clerics like Qureshi. As the trusted voices within their communities, these religious leaders play a crucial role in dispelling harmful myths and misconceptions about vaccines, experts say. 'The best way to fight through this is empowering trusted voices in communities to push back on it and provide real information,' said Kai Ruggeri, a Columbia University health policy professor who has written about vaccine disinformation. The stakes are high. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic. And as World Polio Day arrives this year, there are renewed concerns over their ability to eliminate the disease. The neighboring countries were once on the brink of going polio-free. But persistent insecurity coupled with cross-border movements has fueled a resurgence. Pakistan has recorded 40 cases and Afghanistan at least 20, this year. This marks a significant increase from the six cases each reported last year. A setback came last month when more than 1 million Pakistani children missed vaccinations, and Afghanistan’s Taliban briefly suspended immunization campaigns. Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesman for WHO’s polio eradication program in Geneva, noted that misinformation is not the only obstacle to eliminating polio; a lack of infrastructure, insecurity and population density also contribute. 'The important point is the polio virus doesn't care why a child is not vaccinated,' Rosenbauer said in an interview. 'It’s very, very good at finding that unvaccinated child.' Polio, a crippling disease that can lead to paralysis and death, has long been eradicated globally thanks to universal immunization efforts. For most people around the world, polio is a distant memory or even a relic of history. But in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the disease remains a stark reality despite significant progress in recent decades. Its scars are visible to those who look, Rosenbauer said. 'It’s a disease that parents still see,' he said. 'If you walk around Karachi or Kabul, you’ll still see people with polio on the streets.' This 'respect for the disease' explains why vaccine hesitancy remains around 1.5% in Afghanistan and Pakistan, significantly lower than many Western countries. Yet in densely populated areas, such as the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, lingering resistance can prevent efforts to eradicate the virus. Leading the charge against the vaccine, militants on both sides of the border have waged violent attacks on polio workers and their escorts. Their claim that the vaccine program violates Islamic law and is used for surveillance has fueled resistance. Hundreds have been killed in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. In January, at least five policemen were killed and more than a dozen injured in a major attack on polio teams and security personnel in northwestern Pakistan. According to the Emergency Operations Center in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, militants have carried out 21 attacks against polio teams and security escorts in Pakistan this year. Mainstream clerics have pushed back. In 2019, prominent Islamic scholars from Afghanistan and Pakistan declared the polio vaccine safe and Sharia-compliant. They stressed the 'moral duty' of parents to have their children vaccinated. In 2022, the al-Azhar University, the Sunni Muslim world’s most prestigious institution of religious education, warned against decrees banning the polio vaccine in Pakistan. Last month, nearly 200 renowned religious scholars in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa declared support for polio vaccination. Qureshi, the chief khateeb of KP, was among them. The scholars 'took a strong stand not only regarding the polio vaccine but all health measures by the ministry of health,' Qureshi said. Across the border, Taliban health officials are waging their own campaign against vaccine misinformation even as attacks on health workers, often claimed by ISIS, have persisted. Ehsanul Haq Hanafi, a cleric and senior official in the health ministry, understands the clergy’s influence in Afghan society. 'People listen to the ulema and accept what they say,' Hanafi said in an interview with VOA. Among the myriad misconceptions about the vaccine, he said, some Afghans believe it corrupts morals or causes sterility. Others think it can accelerate puberty, he said. 'This is unscientific and baseless disinformation,' he said. To combat this, Hanafi travels around the country to meet with locals and mullahs to convince the skeptics. While some clerics remain opposed, most accept the vaccine once its benefits are explained, he said. 'We can’t convince 100% of the people, but 80% agree with us and have their children vaccinated,' Hanafi said. VOA’s Ihsan M. Khan contributed to this article.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-afghan-and-pakistani-clerics-are-battling-polio-vaccine-misinformation-/7838106.html	2024-10-24T13:40:46-07:00	
Nigeria drops charges against U.S. executive in money laundering case	Nigeria has released on humanitarian grounds an American citizen held for the past eight months on cryptocurrency money laundering accusations. 'I am pleased that American citizen and former U.S. law enforcement official Tigran Gambaryan has been released on humanitarian grounds by the Nigerian Government and is on his way back to the United States so that he can receive needed medical attention,' U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. 'I am grateful to my Nigerian colleagues and partners for the productive discussions that have resulted in this step and look forward to working closely with them on the many areas of cooperation and collaboration critical to the bilateral partnership between our two countries.' Gambaryan was the chief compliance officer for Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Nigeria accused Gambaryan and Binance of using Binance's platform to launder as much as $35 million, something Gambaryan and Binance have denied. Earlier this week, a prosecuting lawyer with Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission told Nigeria's Federal High Court that the government was ending the case against Gambaryan after 'taking into consideration some critical international and diplomatic reasons.' Gambaryan's health declined in the months following his arrest. Reuters reports that his wife, Yuki, was concerned that his deteriorating condition could 'leave permanent damage and affect his ability to walk.' Binance is facing additional charges, including suspicion of tax evasion and operating without a license. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-drops-charges-against-american-executive-in-money-laundering-scheme-/7838057.html	2024-10-24T13:11:14-07:00

Moldovan president says bribery affected election, pledges run-off vote	CHISINAU, Moldova — Moldova's pro-European president said on Thursday that mass bribery had affected a presidential election and a referendum on joining the European Union. However, Maia Sandu vowed to press on with a Nov. 3 runoff vote to win a second term, instead of ordering a new election. Sandu issued her pledge, saying it was up to the people to determine Moldova's future, after police said pro-Russian fugitive businessman Ilan Shor had channeled $39 million to voters in September and October. Moldovan authorities have said the campaign for last Sunday's dual poll was overshadowed by a massive Russia-linked election-meddling scheme aimed at defeating the pro-Europe side. 'Without the buying of votes, the outcome today would have been different. We would have had a convincing victory in the presidential election and the referendum!' Sandu wrote on social media. She said she had rejected suggestions of ordering a rerun of the ex-Soviet republic's election as 'no one has the right to deny our citizens a mass, sincere and free expression of their will.' 'Let's go forward to the second round. We count strictly on our people as has always been the case when the fate of the country was on the line,' she said. It was up to the judiciary to 'wake up' and tackle the issue of bribery, she added. Sandu came in first in the presidential election but failed to secure 50% of votes and now faces a runoff against former prosecutor-general Alexandr Stoianoglo, who is backed by a traditionally pro-Russian party. Sandu has singled out Russia as one of the biggest threats facing Moldova and made EU integration the cornerstone of her administration. In the referendum, a surprisingly slim majority compared with opinion polls, 50.46% of voters, supported EU accession. The police have accused Shor of an attempt to bribe 130,000 voters. He denies wrongdoing, and the Kremlin has denied interfering. It questioned the vote count, in which votes from Moldovans abroad pushed the 'yes' vote over 50%. Moldova's police chief, Viorel Cernauteanu, told a briefing on Thursday that Shor used Russia's Promsvyazbank to transfer $24 million in October, in addition to $15 million channeled in September, to pay off voters. During the campaign, Shor openly offered to pay Moldovans to persuade others to vote 'no' in the referendum and to support a specific candidate, who he did not name publicly. He launched a bot on the Telegram messaging platform for this means. Cernauteanu said the police had blocked 97 chatbots before the vote explaining to people how to use the Promsvyazbank banking app and get the money. On Monday, Sandu called the campaign 'an unfair fight' and claimed victory in the referendum designed to enshrine Moldova's EU path in the constitution. She said there was 'clear evidence' that criminal groups backed by 'foreign forces hostile to our national interests' had aimed to buy off 300,000 votes. Moscow has denounced the vote as not free. On Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the United States and European Union had meddled in the campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-president-says-bribery-affected-election-pledges-run-off-vote/7838005.html	2024-10-24T12:16:21-07:00	
Fewer Americans trust the news; the question is why	Polls show that Americans’ trust in news reporting is at an all-time low. And while the decline has many causes, it reflects both the changing media landscape and the values of media consumers. Nearly 250 years since the principle was enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, a majority of Americans still agree that a free press is crucial to a democratic society, according to polling by the Pew Research Center. But how they feel about the existing press is a different matter. The same polls show that only one-third of Americans believes the country’s media report the news objectively. And a September Gallup poll reveals that Americans’ overall trust in mass media has declined to an all-time low of 32%. Much of the narrative around declining faith in media has been shaped by political partisanship. The last time that America saw such low levels of media confidence was in 2016, when Donald Trump amplified longstanding conservative complaints about liberal media bias by attacking critical coverage of his presidential campaign as 'fake news.' Accordingly, self-identified Republicans report less trust in media, reaching a low of 11% compared with 58% for Democrats. However, partisan trends don’t capture the whole picture. While partisan divergence in media confidence significantly widened during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, overall trust in media institutions has been declining for supporters of both parties as well as independents since Gallup first began tracking it in the 1970s. The rise of partisan cable news networks in the 1990s and digital news, along with social media in the 2000s, has reflected and exacerbated this trend. And dissatisfaction with perceived bias in coverage of conflicts such as the Iraq War or Israel's invasion of Gaza has also reduced trust in traditional news sources among left-leaning Americans, often driving them toward unreliable alternative sources. As Americans lose trust in traditional media, they also engage less with it. While over half of adults in the U.S. now report getting their news from social media, audiences and advertising revenue have shrunk when it comes to newspapers and TV news. In fact, part of the story behind declining trust in media is Americans across the political spectrum becoming less interested in news overall. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are experiencing news fatigue while 38% report that they follow the news closely, compared with 51% in 2016. Do Americans want independent journalism? The simultaneous loss of trust and interest in news media has raised questions beyond simple accusations of partisan bias. While criticism of the media often focuses on whether the core principles of independent journalism are being upheld, the principles themselves may not be popular. A recent study by the Media Insight Project found that common journalistic values such as amplifying marginalized voices, holding power to account or increasing public transparency do not enjoy majority support. In fact, such values may not be as integral to journalism as is commonly believed. As Columbia University journalism professor Michael Schudson writes, the modern idea of journalism as an independent investigative force and a check on government power has been a fairly recent development. And amid today’s rapid social, political and technological changes, the role that people expect journalism to play in society may once again be shifting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fewer-americans-trust-the-news-the-question-is-why/7837953.html	2024-10-24T11:45:15-07:00	
Zambian president fires 3 constitutional court judges	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — Critics are accusing Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema of interference after he fired three constitutional court judges on Sunday over a 2016 ruling that favored a political opponent. Hichilema fired the judges on the recommendation of a judicial commission that enforces a code of conduct for judges. Hichilema alleged that the judges engaged in misconduct over a ruling they made when he was opposition leader in 2016. Back then, Hichilema had run for president but lost to a sworn rival, Edgar Lungu. Hichilema contested the outcome. Judges Mungeni Mulenga, Palan Musonda and Annie Sitali rejected the legal challenge. The now-dismissed judges also issued a ruling allowing Lungu to run again in 2021, despite his having served twice as president. Lungu was president from 2015 to 2016, then served a full term from 2016 to 2021. Zambian presidents are limited to serving two five-year terms. The decision to fire the judges sparked controversy as it comes ahead of the 2026 general elections. Hichilema and Lungu are expected to face each other for a fourth time. Laura Miti, a human rights activist and political commentator, told VOA the president’s decision to fire the judges raises questions as to why he waited until now to act. Miti said disciplinary action should have been taken much earlier to avoid accusations of interference in the judicial system. 'The position people are taking depends on their political leanings,' she said. 'There are those who say it’s legal, the president has not broken any rules or any laws in firing these judges. 'On the other hand, there are those like myself who feel that because he is the person against whom this judgment went, using executive powers for what is [his] personal interest, is problematic,' Miti said. During an interview with the state broadcaster, former Zambian Vice President Nevers Mumba defended the dismissals of the constitutional court judges. 'None of us is exempted from scrutiny, and if we see that some people have questions that they must answer, I think that the president has the responsibility to release that information,' Mumba said. But Makebi Zulu, who is Lungu‘s lawyer, condemned the firing of the judges, describing it as illegal. 'The executive cannot be seen to be wanting to correct judgments of the courts,' Zulu said. 'They have no such jurisdiction because our legal system is created in such a way that there has to be consistency in the decisions that are being made. Decisions have to be consistent for the purposes of inspiring hope, inspiring trust in our judicial system.' In an interview with VOA, presidential aide Clayson Hamasaka defended the dismissal of the judges, citing constitutional powers granted to the president. The judges have not yet commented on the matter publicly. Zambia‘s chief government spokesperson, Cornelius Mweetwa, told VOA that while the judiciary in Zambia enjoys a measure of independence, such autonomy comes with limits. 'The president is acting within the precincts of the law because the constitution provides that upon recommendation from the Judicial Complaints Commission, the president shall remove the judges,' he said. 'That is exactly what he has done. It is upholding the rule of law and nothing to do with undermining judicial independence.' Zambia's Judicial Complaints Commission enforces the code of conduct for judges. Under Zambia's constitution, all judges, including the chief justice, are appointed by the president upon the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission and with the approval of the National Assembly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zambian-president-fires-3-constitutional-court-judges/7837785.html	2024-10-24T10:04:19-07:00

US military, intelligence agencies ordered to embrace AI	washington — The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have new marching orders — to more quickly embrace and deploy artificial intelligence as a matter of national security. U.S. President Joe Biden signed the directive, part of a new national security memorandum, on Thursday. The goal is to make sure the United States remains a leader in AI technology while also aiming to prevent the country from falling victim to AI tools wielded by adversaries like China. The memo, which calls AI 'an era-defining technology' also lays out guidelines that the White House says are designed to prevent the use of AI to harm civil liberties or human rights. The new rules will 'ensure that our national security agencies are adopting these technologies in ways that align with our values,' a senior administration official told reporters, speaking about the memo on the condition of anonymity before its official release. The official added that a failure to more quickly adopt AI 'could put us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals.' 'Because countries like China recognize similar opportunities to modernize and revolutionize their own military and intelligence capabilities using artificial intelligence, it's particularly imperative that we accelerate our national security community's adoption and use of cutting-edge AI,' the official said. The new guidelines build on an executive order issued last year, which directed all U.S. government agencies to craft policies for how they intend to use AI. They also seek to address issues that could hamper Washington’s ability to more quickly incorporate AI into national security systems. Provisions outlined in the memo call for a range of actions to protect the supply chains the produce advanced computer chips that are critical for AI systems. It also calls for additional actions to combat economic espionage that would allow U.S. adversaries or non-U.S. companies from stealing critical innovations. 'We have to get this right, because there is probably no other technology that will be more critical to our national security in the years ahead,' said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, addressing an audience at the National Defense University in Washington on Thursday. 'The stakes are high,' he said. 'If we don't act more intentionally to seize our advantages, if we don't deploy AI more quickly and more comprehensively to strengthen our national security, we risk squandering our hard-earned lead. 'We could have the best team but lose because we didn't put it on the field,' he added. Although the memo prioritizes the implementation of AI technologies to safeguard U.S. interests, it also directs officials to work with allies and others to create a stable framework for use of AI technologies across the globe. 'A big part of the national security memorandum is actually setting out some basic principles,' Sullivan said, citing ongoing talks with the G-7 and AI-related resolutions at the United Nations. 'We need to ensure that people around the world are able to seize the benefits and mitigate the risks,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-intelligence-agencies-ordered-to-embrace-ai-/7837756.html	2024-10-24T09:40:15-07:00	
Blinken announces $135 million in additional US aid for Palestinians	WASHINGTON — In a latest diplomatic push to end the conflicts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that negotiators will meet 'in the coming days.' He also announced $135 million in additional U.S. aid for Palestinian civilians. 'In referring to negotiators coming back together, that was referring specifically to negotiations on the return of hostages and a cease-fire for Gaza, and that is the entire focus of their work. Separate from that is work that we're doing, also very intensely, on Lebanon to reach a diplomatic resolution,' Blinken said during a press conference in Doha alongside Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The United States is in discussions with regional counterparts on a plan that allows Israel to withdraw from Gaza, ensures that Hamas cannot reconstitute and supports the Palestinian people in governing, securing and rebuilding Gaza. More humanitarian aid 'Today, we're announcing an additional $135 million in humanitarian assistance, water, sanitation, maternal health for Palestinians in Gaza, in the West Bank, as well as in the region,' Blinken said. He emphasized the urgency of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, noting the extraordinary challenges faced daily by people there. 'That's all the more urgent with winter approaching,' Blinken said. This announcement brings total U.S. humanitarian aid to more than $1.2 billion since Oct. 7 of last year. Meanwhile, France hosted an international conference Thursday in Paris to raise funds to help those affected by the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. France announced a pledge of $108 million, while Germany said it is contributing $103 million for aid in Lebanon. Cease-fire talks It remains unclear whether Hamas is prepared to engage in the upcoming cease-fire talks after the death of its leader, Yahya Sinwar. Al Thani told reporters, 'We are closely coordinated with Egypt on any kind of initiatives that will emerge on the table. Today, there [is] an ongoing discussion between Egypt and Hamas. We hope that these discussions will yield to something positive. And the discussion that will come afterward, it will be a follow-up for that.' Al Thani added that U.S. negotiators will meet soon with Israeli counterparts in Doha to attempt a breakthrough. After holding talks in Israel and Saudi Arabia this week, Blinken met Thursday with Al Thani ahead of discussions with Arab officials on Friday in London. Earlier this week, a report by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development painted a grim picture of the economic impact of the Israeli military operation in Gaza from October 2023 to May 2024. The report said that even if the war were to end tomorrow and Gaza returned to its preconflict conditions, it could still take 350 years for Gaza's devastated economy to recover to its already-fragile prewar state. ‘Generals’ Plan’ On Thursday, Blinken renewed the United States' opposition to any Israeli reoccupation of post-war Gaza and 'fully and fundamentally' rejected the so-called Generals’ Plan, a proposal by retired Israeli generals allegedly aimed at blocking humanitarian aid to northern Gaza to starve out Hamas terrorists. Blinken also said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured him during their meetings that this is not the policy of the Israeli government. 'The government of Israel says that it is not the policy of Israel,' Blinken told reporters. In a video message to the Paris aid conference, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate cease-fire and urged meaningful steps toward full implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, which call for the long-term disarmament of Hezbollah and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Guterres noted that more than 1.2 million people have been displaced or affected in Lebanon. 'I call on Lebanon's leaders to take resolute steps toward ensuring fully functional state institutions to address the country's pressing political and security challenges,' Guterres said. On the battlefields Israel’s military said Thursday it conducted a new round of airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons production sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s military said three of its soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike while they were conducting a rescue operation near the village of Yater in southern Lebanon. Israel has said its fight is with Iran-backed Hezbollah, not Lebanon, in a conflict that has raised fears of wider regional hostilities. Medics in Gaza said an Israeli strike hit a school that was being used as a shelter in Nuseirat, killing at least 16 people. On another front Thursday, Syria’s Defense Ministry said Israeli airstrikes hit Damascus, killing at least one soldier and injuring seven other people. Israel rarely comments on strikes against targets in Syria, but it has hit Iran-linked targets there for years as part of a campaign to halt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and disrupt Iranian proxies. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 people as hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,847 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations.

Paris donors conference raises millions in humanitarian aid for Lebanon	Paris — A Lebanon donors’ conference in Paris on Thursday has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the war-battered country — but ending the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah that has devastated the country seems unlikely anytime soon. The pledges rolled in at the Paris conference. Early on, both Germany and France earmarked around $100 million apiece for Lebanon. The funds will support humanitarian aid in the country, where fighting sparked by Hezbollah’s rocket attacks on Israel has killed hundreds and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Conference host, French President Emmanuel Macron, said families need shelter, children need nourishment and schooling, the wounded need care. Solutions must be found quickly, he said, especially to avoid further population displacements, which could create new divisions in the country. Acting Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati wanted more. 'What we as Lebanese expect from the international community is the following: solidarity and cease-fire,' he said. 'Lebanon calls on the international community to come together and support efforts that will end the ongoing aggressions and enforce an immediate cease-fire.' But experts doubt there will be a swift ending to the conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not attend the Paris conference. He was in the Middle East, although Washington sent a lower-level delegation. Israel and Iran were not invited. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu earlier warned that Lebanon could descend into civil war. But analyst Antoine Basbous told Europe 1 radio that the more likely scenario was Lebanon descending into chaos. Former colonial power France hopes parties in Lebanon will move on electing a new president, after a two-year power gap. The Paris meeting additionally aimed to find ways to support the Lebanese army and the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country, which includes a large number of European troops. Both the army and the peacekeeping mission say they have come under attack by Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-donors-conference-raises-millions-in-humanitarian-aid-for-lebanon/7837715.html	2024-10-24T09:23:36-07:00	
US targets Sudan weapons procurement director with sanctions	Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against Mirghani Idris Suleiman, a leading figure in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) efforts to get weapons for the war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the Treasury Department said in a statement. As director of Defense Industries Systems (DIS), the Sudanese army's primary weapons procurement arm, 'Idris has been at the center of weapons deals that have fueled the brutality and scale of the war,' the statement said. 'Today’s action underscores the essential role that key individuals like Mirghani Idris Suleiman have played in procuring weapons, perpetuating violence, and prolonging the fighting in Sudan,' said Bradley Smith, acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. DIS was sanctioned last year by Treasury. Sudan's army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan in a conflict with the army that the United Nations says has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The war has displaced more than 10 million people, driven parts of the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers that have given both sides material support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-sudan-weapons-procurement-director-with-sanctions/7837682.html	2024-10-24T09:02:14-07:00	
Africa Football Business Summit explores strategies to boost sports development	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya is hosting the Africa Football Business Summit to boost football and sports development across the continent. The summit focuses on ways African countries can benefit from the game’s ever-increasing popularity. The meeting comes as East African nations prepare to host the African Cup of Nations in 2027, while Morocco will co-host the 2030 World Cup. In recent international football tournaments, African teams have enjoyed unprecedented success. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, an African team, Morocco, reached the semi-final for the first time. Experts attribute that success not only to talent and hard work but also to significant investment at the community level to nurture talent and produce more quality players. The Football Foundation for Africa, an organization that promotes investment in the sport, has brought together government officials, league representatives, and experts from Europe and Brazil to help Africa grow its football programs and reaping the benefits of the sport’s popularity. The founder, Brian Wesaala, told the gathering that Africa needs to take the game seriously since it can lead to economic prosperity. 'It’s high time football started to make social and economic sense, especially for the African continent,' he said. 'We keep boosting our talent, we keep boosting our youth but when we look at football as an industry, do we really have an agenda as Africa? It's high time that we took up ownership of these conversations and made it ours in order for us to progress as a continent.' The chairperson of the foundation, Mohamed Shidiye, said there is a need to bring the game closer to communities. He believes it can keep children on the right path. 'We are trying to connect the dots in the entire globe to make sure that youth, wherever they are, are able to play football, pull them out of drug menace and make them mentally and physically fit, so that they become a very responsible citizen,' he said. Speaking this week at a meeting of the Confederation of African Football, or CAF, in Ethiopia, the president of world football governing body FIFA called on African countries to invest in young talent. Giovanni Vincenzo Infantino said he wants to see African teams win international tournaments. Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda are set to host the African Cup of Nations in 2027, and government officials and stakeholders have been conducting a series of meetings to attract investors and learn how they can win financially from the tournament in the long term. The chief commercial officer of the Uganda Premier League, Jovin Matovu, says East African countries will work to maximize revenue sources such as ticket sales, broadcast media deals and commercial sponsorships. 'We’ve got an opportunity as East Africa to host the biggest football competition in the region,' he said. 'It's time to justify to the investors if you put this much here, this is what you are getting in return. We are preparing the fans, our clubs, the media, the corporate companies for the entire value chain to see where to invest and how to get a return that can be sustained.' In six years, Morocco co-hosts the World Cup along with Portugal and Spain. Football authorities there hope not only for a repeat of the on-field success seen in 2022, but also the financial benefits that can come from hosting the world’s most popular sporting event.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-football-business-summit-explores-strategies-to-boost-sports-development/7837666.html	2024-10-24T08:48:47-07:00	
Canada slashes immigration as public concern rises	Ottawa — Canada said Thursday it was significantly curbing immigration targets in an effort to 'pause population growth,' a shift that comes as public support for immigration declines. The announcement comes after the Canadian population surged to 41 million, a rise largely fueled by an unprecedented wave of new arrivals. The immigration ministry had previously planned to let 500,000 new permanent residents settle in the country in 2025 and 2026. But the new targets were revised down to 395,000 next year and 380,000 for 2026. It set the 2027 target at 365,000. The immigration ministry said the plan's goal was to 'pause population growth in the short term to achieve well-managed, sustainable growth in the long term.' 'While it's clear our economy needs newcomers, we see the pressures facing our country, and we must adapt our policies accordingly,' Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in the statement. The ministry said the plan also aims to ease pressure on housing, with Canadians consistently ranking the cost of renting or owning a home as a top concern. The ministry credited an immigration surge with helping the Canadian economy emerge from the COVID pandemic without entering a recession. A survey last month from the Environics Institute on public attitudes toward immigration found that 'for the first time in a quarter century, a clear majority of Canadians say there is too much immigration.' Fifty-eight percent of Canadians believe the country takes in too many immigrants, up 14 percentage points from 2023, the survey found.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-slashes-immigration-as-public-concern-rises-/7837667.html	2024-10-24T08:42:04-07:00	
Ruling party candidate wins presidential vote in Mozambique	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Mozambique's ruling party candidate, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the country's presidential election Thursday amid claims of rigging by the opposition. According to the national election commission, Chapo won 70.7% of the national vote, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane with 20.2%. The candidate of the opposition party Renamo, Ossufo Momade, came third with 5.8%. The results of the October 9 election mean the governing Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, has extended its 49 years in power since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and contested this election. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms allowed. The EU's observer mission said this week that some of its election observers had been prevented from monitoring counting in some areas and there was an 'unjustified alteration' of results at some polling stations. Opposition parties have alleged there was fraud since the day of the election. The country of around 33 million people has been on edge since two senior opposition figures, including a lawyer involved in a possible legal challenge of the election results, were killed last week when gunmen ambushed them and riddled their car with bullets. Police also quelled demonstrations by opposition supporters this week, dispersing them by firing tear gas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ruling-party-candidate-wins-presidential-vote-in-mozambique/7837618.html	2024-10-24T08:13:47-07:00	
India, China move to stabilize ties, but mistrust lingers	A bilateral meeting between the Indian and Chinese leaders held Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS summit is expected to pave the way for improving political and economic ties damaged by a border standoff four years ago.

Former Pakistan PM Khan's wife released from prison	Islamabad — Pakistani authorities released the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan from prison Thursday, nearly nine months after the couple was sentenced on corruption allegations. Former first lady Bushra Bibi was allowed to leave the Adiala jail near Islamabad a day after a federal high court approved her bail application. Leaders of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party said Bibi traveled to her residence on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital after her release. 'Welcome back Bushra Bibi!' wrote the PTI on its social media platform X. Khan, 72, and Bibi were sentenced to 14 years in January on accusations of illegally retaining and selling state gifts received during his time in office from 2018 to 2022. They were later convicted and received additional sentences in several other cases, including charges of illegal marriage. However, appeals courts overturned or suspended all convictions and sentences in the months that followed, but Pakistani authorities refused to release the couple, instead announcing new charges against them in July related to fresh allegations of selling state gifts worth more than half a million dollars. Khan denies any wrongdoing and rejects all the more than 150 lawsuits as political victimization by the country’s military-backed government to keep him from returning to national politics, charges his successors and military officials denied. The cricket star-turned-prime minister was ousted from power through an opposition parliamentary vote of no-confidence 18 months ago before being imprisoned in August 2023. The legal battles and subsequent convictions have barred Khan from pursuing public office. His party was banned from participating in the national election in February. Khan maintains that the vote was rigged to prevent his party from winning the vote and allowing his rivals to form a coalition government with the help of the military. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and military officials reject the allegations. Appeal by US lawmakers Meanwhile, Pakistan on Thursday criticized a letter sent to President Joe Biden by more than 60 Democratic lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives, urging him to secure the release of Khan and all other political prisoners. 'The United States and Pakistan have a long-standing cooperative relationship,' Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told her weekly news conference in Islamabad. 'However, interference in our internal affairs through letters like this is not acceptable and undermines diplomatic decorum,' she added. Baloch made her comments after the group of U.S. Congress members expressed their concerns to Biden about Khan’s incarceration and the alleged widespread human rights abuses in Pakistan. 'At a minimum, we ask your administration to urgently secure the guarantees from the Pakistani government for Khan's safety and well-being and urge U.S. Embassy officials to visit him in prison,' the letter to Biden read. It described Khan as a political leader 'with widespread support in the country.' The letter noted that in February, the Pakistani parliamentary elections saw a historic level of irregularities, including widespread electoral fraud, state-led efforts to disenfranchise voters, and the arrest and detention of political leaders, journalists, and activists. 'More broadly, developments since the February vote point to a clear turn towards authoritarianism in the country,' the letter said. '… Simply put, Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade,' stated the letter written by Representative Greg Casar and co-leaders of the group, Representatives Jim McGovern and Summer Lee. Pakistan’s military has staged three coups and placed the country under more than three decades of dictatorial rule since it gained independence in 1947. The powerful security institution and its intelligence units are persistently accused of meddling in national politics and orchestrating the making or breaking of elected governments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-pakistan-pm-khan-wife-released-from-prison/7837527.html	2024-10-24T07:38:04-07:00	
Venezuelan opposition figures win EU's top rights Sakharov prize	Strasbourg, France — The EU parliament awarded the bloc's top rights Sakharov prize on Thursday to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and her ally, former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia. They won the prestigious award for their fight for democracy under President Nicolas Maduro's iron-fisted rule. Machado, 57, played a key role in Venezuela's presidential election in July. Although the authorities proclaimed Maduro the winner, the opposition believes its candidate Gonzalez Urrutia won. Gonzalez Urrutia, 75, went into exile in Spain in September. European Parliament chief Roberta Metsola said the two figures represented 'all Venezuelans inside and outside the country fighting to restore freedom and democracy', as she announced the award in the parliament in Strasbourg, France. 'Edmundo and Maria have continued to fight for the fair, free and peaceful transition of power and have fearlessly upheld those values that millions of Venezuelans and this parliament hold so dear: justice, democracy and the rule of law,' Metsola added. 'This parliament stands with the people of Venezuela and with Maria and Edmundo in their struggle for the democratic future of their country,' Metsola said. 'We are confident that Venezuela and democracy, will ultimately prevail,' she added. There will be an award ceremony in Strasbourg in December. The winner receives a $54,000 prize. Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia were named for the award by the center-right European People's Party, the largest political grouping in the EU parliament. The two other finalists were jailed Azerbaijani activist Gubad Ibadoghlu -- backed by the Greens -- and Israeli and Palestinian organizations working together for peace, proposed by the Socialists and Democrats group. Metsola paid tribute to the finalists, saying they 'all are bravely standing up for human rights and for freedom of thought in the face of unimaginable challenges'. She said that the health of Ibadoghlu — under house arrest — was 'currently deteriorating significantly' and called on 'Azerbaijani authorities to drop all charges against Doctor Ibadoghlu and lift his travel ban'. Far-right lawmakers had nominated US tech billionaire Elon Musk as a champion of 'free speech', but their eyebrow-raising choice was not accepted. Named after Soviet physicist and political dissident Andrei Sakharov, previous recipients of the award include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. For Machado, it is her second prize in as many months as she won the top European rights prize awarded by the Council of Europe, which is not an EU institution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-opposition-figures-win-eu-top-rights-sakharov-prize/7837115.html	2024-10-24T05:37:42-07:00	
Still without any opposition, Uzbekistan votes for parliament	Tashkent, Uzbekistan — A country that appeared to promise genuine political opposition during a parliamentary election campaign five years ago is about to vote again on Sunday — still without any. Uzbekistan's dissidents persist in efforts to register their parties despite repeated rejections. And America’s top diplomat in Tashkent continues to encourage the country to stay on the course of reforms. But for many Uzbeks, real democracy remains a remote and not particularly appealing prospect. 'What is an independent parliament? What is democracy? We have never had either,' said Matluba Boltayeva, an entrepreneur in Andijan, eastern Uzbekistan. Boltayeva told VOA it is more important to her that she can now visit relatives in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, which became possible after the government of Uzbekistan’s president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, increased crossing points and expanded commercial opportunities. 'I don’t care about the members of the Oliy Majlis,' she added, referring to the Uzbek parliament. 'I don’t want any political change, and certainly no opposition.' Boltayeva’s sentiments resonate with many in Uzbekistan. During VOA’s travels around the country, residents frequently expressed low expectations of their legislators. Many believe that the country’s laws are made and enforced solely by the president. A popular blogger, known for discussing rural issues and who ran for local office in 2019, now fears revealing his name to share this opinion: 'We deserve this regime. People want a strongman as a leader, taking care of our basic needs. They don’t want to complicate things.' His views reflect the widespread cynicism about democracy VOA heard in several cities and villages. 'Our people look at democracies like those in America, India, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia and wonder, ‘Why would we want that chaos?’ There isn’t enough desire, if any, for political or ideological contest here, which to people means disagreement and disorder.' Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East have also shaped Uzbek perceptions, reinforcing the value of independence and stability — key election themes echoed by the five political parties, all supporting President Mirziyoyev and his policies. Alisher Qodirov, head of the National Revival Democratic Party, who in 2019 pledged to turn his faction into an opposition, later told VOA, 'How can we oppose the administration when it’s doing exactly what we advocate — economic reforms, investing in education, health care, and infrastructure, while also promoting our national values?' While Qodirov and others contend that the parliament is relevant, social media users often disagree. They refer to the parties as 'puppets,' accusing them of merely promoting the state’s agenda rather than offering solutions. In an interview with VOA, U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick praised recent televised debates but noted that the parliament lacks transparency. 'We need to see more of that because, for the parliament to fulfill its potential in the Uzbek system, it needs to be empowered and communicate its role to the public,' Henick said. The U.S. government does not support any specific political party, he says, 'but we do support the registration of opposition parties in Uzbekistan. I think the Uzbek people, the voters, deserve as much choice as they can get.' Both the U.S. and Uzbekistan are members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, whose Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, has deployed an election observation mission, with 14 international experts, 26 long-term and 300 short-term observers. OSCE/ODIHR has previously monitored 10 elections and referenda in Uzbekistan, none of which was deemed free or fair. Its consistent recommendation has been to create space for political competition. 'People will feel more vested in the system if their representatives — the ones that speak to them and get their votes — are represented in parliament,' said Henick. The administration deserves credit for its reforms so far, he told VOA. 'But I’ve also been candid about where things fall short.' Henick cited the U.S. State Department’s critical reports on human rights, which point out problematic areas in Uzbekistan. 'We see this government as a partner,' he said, underlining that Washington values its strategic ties with Tashkent. Henick works closely with President Mirziyoyev’s office, now largely run by his eldest daughter, Saida Mirziyoyeva, whom he described as 'a productive and capable interlocutor.' 'I don't presume to judge or cast judgment on the president here regarding whom he chooses as his advisers. That is up to him,' said Henick, who also spoke positively about Western-educated ministers, regarding them as strong advocates for reform. Like Henick, many Uzbeks argue that their society is undergoing a transition. They now expect more from their government, especially local authorities. While the media environment is less vibrant compared to 2017–2021, the initial reform period, journalists and bloggers say they still push for public discourse on key issues. Henick observes that civil society groups struggle to register because officials do not view them as partners in delivering public services. However, he assesses the impact of bloggers and grassroots activists as evidence Uzbekistan will shape its own democracy. 'If we are truthful in our desire to support that democratic development, we shouldn't be trying to impose a model from the outside. We should be working with the individuals and organizations already here in Uzbekistan,' Henick said. Khidirnazar Allakulov, who has been trying to register a political party since 2021, firmly believes Uzbekistan needs and deserves real opposition. Nearing 70 and with his activist son in prison, Allakulov said he is 'committed to fighting authoritarianism.' He claims to have thousands of supporters 'despite arrests and repression' and rejects the popular skepticism about democracy. 'I wouldn’t push for change if I thought our people had no faith in freedom and justice, which are essential for stability. Uzbekistan aspires to have all these things. But we also know that fear rules,' he said. Allakulov believes the main reason authorities block his party’s registration is its opposition to 'one-man rule and nepotism.' He believes Uzbekistan deserves better governance — not through a coup, but through democratic elections. Recently renaming his group the 'Liberator Nation Party,' Allakulov talks with the international community, including OSCE/ODIHR, but insists that no outside influence should interfere with the registration process. Authorities maintain that Allakulov’s party has failed to meet the registration requirements, including securing the necessary 20,000 signatures. 'We won’t know the impact of political competition until we see it,' said Jasur Muminov, a graduate student in Tashkent. 'How we get there, I don’t know. But knowing our state, I predict two scenarios: either the government will introduce its fake ‘opposition party’ to show the world ‘democratic progress,’ or we’ll continue without any. But I’ll be voting on October 27.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/still-without-any-opposition-uzbekistan-votes-for-parliament-/7837071.html	2024-10-24T04:49:57-07:00	
Melodic greeting between women in Burundi is at risk of being lost	NGOZI, Burundi — The hug between the two women looked like it would last forever. A spirited 85-year-old had embraced a younger woman she hadn’t seen for months, and she chanted a number of questions in the peculiar yodeling routine of her ancestors. How are you? How is your husband? How are the kids? How are your cows? Are you on good terms with your neighbors? And so on. Prudencienne Namukobwa paused in the melody to allow the younger woman's rhythmic affirmation, a pattern she has mastered over the decades. 'Ego,' Emelyne Nzeyimana replied over and over in the local Kirundi language. 'Yes.' A group of neighbors watched in amazement. Many were seeing their first performance of the traditional form of musical greeting, known to Burundians as akazehe. It is performed exclusively by women on a range of occasions. But akazehe is fading, despite its unique status in this central African country that is better known for its world-famous percussionists. That's according to cultural officials, teachers and others who say the practice is worth preserving. They cited the threat from public health measures that discourage unnecessary contact during disease outbreaks, in addition to the perceived failure to promote akazehe among school-going youth. Among young Burundians, it is hard to find people who know what akazehe means and even harder to find someone who can perform it. 'At a certain time, unfortunately, it was abandoned,' said Sandrine Kitonze, a culture adviser in the office of the governor of Ngozi province. She said akazehe and its minutes-long embrace 'made you feel that the person who greets you loves you.' Some academics have noted akazehe’s potential role in fostering social cohesion in Burundi, which is now largely peaceful after a period of deadly civil war followed by political instability. Annonciate Baragahorana, a teacher in the province of Bujumbura, which includes the commercial capital, told The Associated Press that while she was not born in a place where akazehe was widely practiced, she was astonished as a young girl when women embraced and addressed her in the polyphonic way during visits to other regions. 'The women who often did this lived in the central plateau provinces. When we went there during the holidays, a woman from the interior of the country kissed you strongly while wishing you wonders and she hugged you for a long time,' she said with a chuckle. 'I wanted her to finish quickly, even if it was sweet words to hear.' Baragahorana said she feared 'tenderness in social relationships will disappear' among Burundians amid threats from contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and mpox. 'People greet each other from a distance for fear of contaminating each other,' she said. 'This will contribute enormously to the demise of akazehe.' In Ngozi, a hilly province in Burundi’s north, akazehe remains familiar to some locals, and women such as Namukobwa are impressive at performing it. She lives in a decaying house set in the side of a verdant hill. One recent morning, she was sitting on a mat outside when she glimpsed Nzeyimana, the visiting daughter of a former neighbor. She overcame her bad hip to rise and welcome the woman, whom she addressed as if she were her biological daughter. 'I felt that the first love she had when I was just a girl is kept until now,' said Nzeyimana, a broadcaster in Ngozi. 'This means that I am still her daughter.' Akazehe can seem like a race to perfect accord, a search for harmony, in the interwoven vocalizations. While most questions are routine, some can be unexpected. Nzeyimana said afterward that she had been anxious over possibly facing a question for which she was not ready with a positive response. There was none. Serena Facci, an Italian scholar at the University of Rome Tor Vergata who has written about akazehe, said that even by 1993, when she went to Burundi for research in ethnomusicology, 'this beautiful female greeting wasn't very common in the ordinary life.' Its continuing disappearance could be due to changing lifestyles, she said. A custom such as akazehe should be preserved at all costs because of its role in protecting families, said Isaac Nikobiba, an anthropologist in Bujumbura. Among communities that practiced it, women could alert mother figures to any turbulence at home, triggering supportive measures from the extended family, he said. Nikobiba called the potential disappearance of akazehe symptomatic of wider cultural losses stemming from modernization. 'Normally, before starting a home in traditional Burundi, the girl would first receive advice from her paternal aunt who would tell her, ‘I will come to greet you after a certain time. If you notice an anomaly in the home, you will have to tell me everything,’' he said. 'In short, if she does not find someone to whom she can confide her marital intimacies, she spends all the time in a very bad psychological atmosphere.' Floride Ntakirutimana was among the small group of women who gathered to witness the spectacle of Namukobwa greeting Nzeyimana. She said she grew up in a farming community where no mother could perform akazehe, and only heard of it through radio programs. The exchange she watched left her feeling she wanted to learn akazehe herself. 'I feel better, and I saw that it was good,' Ntakirutimana said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/melodic-greeting-between-women-in-burundi-is-at-risk-of-being-lost-/7837026.html	2024-10-24T04:05:00-07:00	
BRICS meeting highlights geopolitical aspirations, rivalries with West	NEW DELHI — While U.S. officials express the view that the BRICS grouping meeting in the Russian city of Kazan is not evolving into a geopolitical rival, analysts say BRICS members are working on issues that could eventually concern the Western world. Among the topics discussed between members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are ways to establish an alternative payment system that would not be dependent on the U.S. dollar, a BRICS digital currency and an alternative to Western financial institutions like the International Monetary fund. China, Russia and Iran – countries that face severe trade restrictions imposed by the United States – have been particularly keen about advancing BRICS’ stated goals. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated at the BRICS meeting that he was equally interested. 'We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation,' Modi said. Russian State Duma Speaker Vyachaslav Volodin, writing ahead of the two-day meeting on the cloud-based messaging app Telegram, said the BRICS’ priorities reflect the divide between the West and the South. 'The time of the hegemony of Washington and Brussels is passing. Countries choose the path of equal dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation in the interests of people, and not to please the US and its minions,' he said. U.S. officials say they are not concerned. 'We're not looking at BRICS evolving into some kind of geopolitical rival. That’s not how we look at it ... to the U.S. or anyone else,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday at a press briefing. Meanwhile, India’s Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met Wednesday on the sidelines of the BRICS meeting, signaling a thaw in relations between the two sometimes-adversarial nations that some analysts suggest could have geopolitical implications. Two days before the BRICS meeting, Indian and Chinese officials agreed to resolve the vexing issue of their militaries patrolling along the India-China border. The goal is to ensure that both sides pull back troops from advanced positions in disputed areas and return to the situation that existed before the last border conflict in 2020. 'We welcome the consensus reached on the issues that have arisen in the last 4 years along the border. It should be our priority to ensure there is peace and stability along our border,' Modi told Xi during the initial minutes of the meeting, which was telecast live. Xi responded saying that the rapprochement was 'in the fundamental interests of both countries.' Analysts are trying to gauge what prompted India to seek rapprochement with Beijing when it is closely tied to U.S.-led arrangements meant to counter China’s influence. India plays a key role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy and the Washington-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) involving Japan, India, Australia and the United States. China views the QUAD, which regularly holds exercises among the militaries of the four member countries, as a group bent on hurting its interests. 'Being a part of the QUAD is not helping India, which needs support in countering China’s military challenge in the Himalayan Mountain region. Besides, the U.S. is developing a relationship with Pakistan, which is against India’s interest,' P. Stobdan, former Indian diplomat and author, told VOA. The Chinese media quoted Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of Strategic Studies and International Security in Fudan University, as saying that India is seeking reconciliation with China because the United States has not supported its efforts to develop its manufacturing sector. 'India's policy that aims at decoupling from China has failed to attract meaningful support from the U.S.-led West to help 'Made in India' and the country's modernization and industrialization,' Lin said. 'This proves that India can't profit from being hostile to or decoupling from China, and it is even making it difficult for India to realize its own development,' he added. Some experts believe the United States would not be surprised at the turn of events. 'The U.S. knew all along that India and China would connect at some point. There are strong political and economic reasons for them to engage with each other,' said Manoranjan Mohanty, a China expert based in New Delhi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brics-meeting-highlights-geopolitical-aspirations-rivalries-with-west/7836994.html	2024-10-24T03:24:11-07:00	
Indonesia says Chinese vessel twice driven away after disrupting energy survey	JAKARTA, Indonesia — A Chinese coast guard vessel was driven out of Indonesia's waters for a second time this week after it initially disrupted a survey by state energy firm Pertamina in the South China Sea, Indonesia's maritime security agency said on Thursday. While Chinese coast guard vessels have been spotted numerous times in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone, the most recent incidents came just days after Prabowo Subianto took over Indonesia's presidency. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea via a 'nine-dash line' on its maps that cuts into the EEZs of Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016 said China's claim has no basis under international law, a ruling Beijing does not recognize. The incidents took place off Indonesia Natuna islands, roughly 1,500 km from China's Hainan island. The exact locations were not immediately clear. The Chinese vessel on Monday insisted the area was China's jurisdiction, Indonesia's maritime security agency, known as Bakamla, said in a statement. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'Bakamla will keep patrolling and intensively monitoring the waters of North Natuna to ensure seismic data gathering can go without disruption to Indonesia’s sovereignty,' the agency said on Monday. On Thursday, it said the Chinese vessel returned but was intercepted and again driven out. It did not provide details on what the ship was doing. China asserts its claim of sovereignty via an armada of coast guard ships deployed throughout the South China Sea, some of which are accused by its neighbors of aggressive conduct and of trying to disrupt energy and fisheries activities. China typically says its coast guard operates lawfully to deter territorial infringements in what are its waters. In 2021 vessels from Indonesia and China shadowed each other for months near a submersible oil rig that had been performing well appraisals in the Natuna Sea. China at the time urged Indonesia to stop drilling in what was its territory. The latest incidents came as Indonesia's new defense minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, met Thursday with the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta. The defense ministry in a statement said Sjafrie expected to boost defense cooperation with China, including joint exercises. It made no mention of this week's maritime incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-says-chinese-vessel-twice-driven-away-after-disrupting-energy-survey/7836971.html	2024-10-24T02:51:27-07:00	
Blinken meets with Qatari officials in push to resolve conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Thursday with Qatar’s ruling emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani as part of a tour of the region in which Blinken has focused discussions on ending the conflicts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Blinken is also meeting Thursday with Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed Al Thani ahead of talks with Arab officials Friday in London. While one of Blinken’s agenda items has been to seek an increase in humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza, France hosted an international conference Thursday in Paris to raise funds to help those affected by the war between Israel and Hamas in Lebanon. Israel’s military said Thursday it conducted a new round of airstrikes against Hezbollah weapons production sites in Beirut’s southern suburbs. Lebanon’s military said three of its soldiers were killed in an Israeli strike while they were conducting a rescue operation near the village of Yater in southern Lebanon. Israel has said its fight is with Iran-backed Hezbollah, not Lebanon, in a conflict that has raised fears of wider regional hostilities. On another front Thursday, Syria’s defense ministry said Israeli airstrikes hit Damascus, killing at least one soldier and injuring seven other people. Israel rarely comments on strikes against targets in Syria, but it has hit Iran-linked targets there for years as part of a campaign to halt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and disrupt Iranian proxies. Blinken’s tour has included stops in Israel and Saudi Arabia where he discussed the importance of halting the fighting in Gaza and securing the release of hostages still being held there by Iran-backed Hamas. The top U.S. diplomat has also looked to the eventual end of the conflict, focusing part of his talks with officials on security, governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, during which the militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 people as hostages. Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, with a third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,700 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-meets-with-qatari-officials-in-push-to-resolve-conflicts-in-gaza-lebanon/7836967.html	2024-10-24T02:37:37-07:00	
Boeing strike barrels on as workers reject wage deal	SEATTLE — Boeing factory workers voted to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week strike on Wednesday, in a blow to new CEO Kelly Ortberg's plan to shore up the finances of the struggling planemaker. The vote was 64% in opposition to the deal, which offered a 35% rise in wages over four years, in a major setback for Ortberg who took the top job in August on a pledge to work more closely with factory workers than his predecessors. The rejection of Boeing's offer, which comes after 95% of workers voted against a first contract last month, reflects years of resentment from workers who felt cheated by the company in talks a decade ago and deepens a financial crisis. After the vote, union leaders said they were ready to immediately resume negotiations with Boeing on the first major negotiation since 2014, when the company used the threat of moving production of the new version of the 777 out of the region to push through a deal that ended traditional pensions. The union has been seeking a 40% pay rise and the return of the defined-benefit pension. Boeing factory workers were also venting frustration after a decade when their wages have lagged inflation and critics have complained that the planemaker spent tens of billions of dollars on share buybacks and paid out record executive bonuses. 'This membership has gone through a lot … there are some deep wounds,' the union's lead contract negotiator Jon Holden told reporters after the vote. 'I want to get back to the table. Boeing needs to come to the table as well. Hopefully, we can have some fruitful discussions with the company, and Mr. Ortberg, to try and resolve this.' Boeing declined comment on the vote. Some 33,000 machinists downed tools in Boeing's West Coast factories on Sept. 13, halting production of the best-selling 737 MAX as well as 767 and 777 wide-body programs. Time is running out for Boeing, historically the largest U.S. exporter, and its biggest union to reach a deal before the busy political period surrounding the presidential election on Nov. 5. With Boeing and IAM at a stalemate earlier this month, acting U.S. Secretary of Labor Julie Su had helped get the latest offer presented for a vote after attending in-person talks with both parties in Seattle last week. Holden said after the union vote that he would reach out to the White House to see if the union could get more assistance negotiating with Boeing. 'After the first contract offer was rejected, the honeymoon was over on the labor reset. This further validates that,' said Scott Hamilton, an aviation consultant. 'It's bad news for everybody - Boeing, labor, suppliers, customers, even the national economy.' Boeing is the largest customer for a U.S. aerospace supply chain already facing critical financial pressure. Fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems warned that if the strike continued beyond the end of November, there would be layoffs and more drastic furloughs. The company, which is in the process of being taken over by Boeing, has already announced a 21-day furlough for 700 workers. 'Defining moment' Boeing has announced plans to cut 17,000 jobs and is closing in on a plan to raise up to $15 billion from investors to help preserve its investment grade credit rating, while some airlines have had to trim schedules due to aircraft delivery delays. Ortberg warned on Wednesday there was no quick fix for the ailing planemaker. In a quarterly earnings call, Boeing forecast it would burn cash through 2025. Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said after the vote that the decision to prolong the strike could worsen the expected drain on cash. The specter of a quality crisis from a January mid-air panel blowout hangs over Boeing. Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said this was now the 'defining moment' of Ortberg's short tenure and he needed to get a deal across the line soon. 'There's a feeling that he hasn't handled this as well as he might have,' Aboulafia said. 'They've (Boeing) got to get this done, and they're in a position of weakness.' The rejection from workers on Wednesday was the second in a formal vote after the offer of a 25% pay rise over four years was rejected last month, leading to the strike. Many comments on social media and from workers outside voting stations had cast doubt on a deal. 'We're ready to go back on strike until we get a better deal,' Irina Briones, 25, said after the vote. 'They took a bunch of numbers and moved them around to make them look like they're giving us more than they were,' said Josh Hajek, 42, who has worked six years at Boeing on wing assembly. Voting figures showed the two sides getting closer to a deal but still a solid majority in favor of prolonging the strike. Before the vote, Terrin Spotwood, a 20-year-old machinist in 737 wing assembly, said he planned to approve the contract because the offer was 'good, but not great.' He said several coworkers planned the same because they 'can't really afford to say no to this contract. They have to go back to work.' Even so, many workers are still angry about the last deal signed a decade ago. 'We're going to get what we want this time. We have better legs to stand on this time than Boeing,' said Donovan Evans, 30, who works in the 767 jet factory outside Seattle.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-strike-barrels-on-as-workers-reject-wage-deal/7836963.html	2024-10-24T02:19:04-07:00	
New evidence China, Russia and Iran targeting US elections	WASHINGTON — There is new evidence China, Iran and Russia are aggressively expanding their efforts to influence American voters to potentially sway the result of the upcoming U.S. elections. Two threat intelligence reports Wednesday, one from software giant Microsoft and the other from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, detail growing activity by cyber actors linked to each country — all aiming to impact U.S. public perceptions with less than two weeks before voters go to the polls. The biggest change, according to Microsoft, comes from Chinese-linked actors known to researchers as Spamouflage or Taizi Flood. 'Chinese influence operations have recently taken a new turn, shifting focus to several down-ballot candidates and members of Congress,' Microsoft said, noting that starting in September, China has targeted at least four prominent Republican lawmakers, all of whom are known critics of the government in Beijing. Most recently, the Chinese-linked accounts targeted Texas Republican Michael McCaul, accusing the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of 'abusing power for personal gain.' Late last month, other Spamouflage began going after Tennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, Microsoft said. And earlier this month, the same effort began promoting Blackburn’s opponent in the November 5 election. Other targets include Alabama Republican Representative Barry Moore, who was subjected to content criticizing his support for Israel, and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republican Marco Rubio, who was accused of corruption. The Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected the allegations in the Microsoft report. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ domestic affairs,' embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told VOA Wednesday, echoing previous Chinese denials. 'Such allegations are full of malicious speculations against China, which China firmly opposes,' he added. U.S. lawmakers, however, said they were not surprised by the uptick in malign activity. 'The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] cannot stand anyone who supports and gives a voice to those they oppress; their response is to sanction and attack,' McCaul said in a statement to VOA. 'I consider it a badge of honor when the CCP — a leading abuser of human rights, censor of free speech, and oppressor of its own people — takes issue with my work,' he said. Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for the Chinese influence efforts to 'be taken very seriously.' 'China is becoming increasingly more aggressive,' Rubio said in a statement to VOA. 'China’s goal is to shape American opinion on critical issues and target specific candidates, especially those they view as anti-China.' Growing threats The reports from Microsoft and Recorded Future warn Beijing is not alone. Specifically, the reports caution the Russian-linked cyber actors, known to researchers as Storm-1679 or Operation Overload, have increased their pace of operations over the past month and a half and are showing signs that more influence operations are on the way. 'Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities,' said the Recorded Future report. Recorded Future said many of the Russian efforts, of late, have sought to provoke anger toward the LGBTQ+ community 'using disinformation to perpetuate discriminatory beliefs around transgender individuals, perceived behavioral issues, gender transition and reassignment surgeries, and pharmaceutical treatments.' Other influence operations, the report said, are making use of AI-generated voiceovers to emulate the style of U.S. broadcast journalists. Microsoft said the Russian cyber actors also have found ways to reach additional U.S. voters by shifting much of the content from the Telegram social media platform to X. 'Storm-1679 videos posted to X received higher levels of engagement,' Microsoft said. Microsoft researchers also warned there are signs Iran is also ramping up its election interference efforts. The Microsoft report says that in one instance, less than two weeks ago, 'an online persona operated by Iran began falsely posing as an American and called on Americans to boycott the elections due to both candidates’ support for Israel’s military operations.' Russia and Iran, like China, have repeatedly denied any involvement in efforts to meddle with the U.S. election. But the new findings from Microsoft and Recorded Future align with assessments from U.S. intelligence officials. 'Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests,' according to a declassified assessment issued Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. U.S. intelligence officials have previously said Russia has been working to boost the chances of former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has been working to hurt Trump’s reelection bid and instead buoy the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. And while there is little evidence to suggest China has sought to affect the U.S. presidential race, intelligence officials have said Beijing has been focusing its efforts on congressional and state and local candidates perceived to be promoting policies detrimental to Beijing's interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-evidence-china-russia-and-iran-targeting-us-elections/7836957.html	2024-10-24T02:08:40-07:00	
AI decodes oinks and grunts to keep pigs happy in Danish study	VIPPEROD, Denmark — European scientists have developed an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of interpreting pig sounds, aiming to create a tool that can help farmers improve animal welfare. The algorithm could potentially alert farmers to negative emotions in pigs, thereby improving their well-being, according to Elodie Mandel-Briefer, a behavioral biologist at University of Copenhagen who is co-leading the study. The scientists, from universities in Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, France, Norway and the Czech Republic, used thousands of recorded pig sounds in different scenarios, including play, isolation and competition for food, to find that grunts, oinks, and squeals reveal positive or negative emotions. While many farmers already have a good understanding of the well-being of their animals by watching them in the pig pen, existing tools mostly measure their physical condition, said Mandel-Briefer. 'Emotions of animals are central to their welfare, but we don't measure it much on farms,' she said. The algorithm demonstrated that pigs kept in outdoor, free-range or organic farms with the ability to roam and dig in the dirt produced fewer stress calls than conventionally raised pigs. The researchers believe that this method, once fully developed, could also be used to label farms, helping consumers make informed choices. 'Once we have the tool working, farmers can have an app on their phone that can translate what their pigs are saying in terms of emotions,' Mandel-Briefer said. Short grunts typically indicate positive emotions, while long grunts often signal discomfort, such as when pigs push each other by the trough. High-frequency sounds like screams or squeals usually mean the pigs are stressed, for instance, when they are in pain, fight, or are separated from each other. The scientists used these findings to create an algorithm that employs AI. 'Artificial intelligence really helps us to both process the huge amount of sounds that we get, but also to classify them automatically,' Mandel-Briefer said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-decodes-oinks-and-grunts-to-keep-pigs-happy-in-danish-study/7836947.html	2024-10-24T01:40:39-07:00	
Tropical Storm Trami wreaks havoc in the Philippines, at least 26 dead	Manila, Philippines — Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast. Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon triggering widespread flooding and landslides. With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph, the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea, the state weather agency said in its 11 a.m. weather bulletin. It warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces. Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said. Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province. The town's disaster chief, Ezikiel Chavez, said no fatalities had been reported. The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods. Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centers, the civil defense office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses. The civil aviation regulator said on Thursday at least a dozen flights across the country had been cancelled due to the storm. The central bank cancelled foreign exchange trading and monetary operations for a second straight day. The Philippines typically records an average of 20 tropical storms annually, often resulting in heavy rains, strong winds, and deadly landslides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-trami-wreaks-havoc-in-the-philippines-at-least-26-dead/7836920.html	2024-10-23T23:43:38-07:00	
Japan's rising ramen prices give election voters food for thought	TOKYO — Taisei Hikage is fighting a losing battle at his Tokyo ramen shop - not to attract customers, but to keep a lid on the price he charges for Japan's national comfort food in the face of an incessant rise in ingredient and fuel costs. Since opening his shop in the west of the capital a year and a half ago, Hikage, 26, has raised menu prices three times but still struggles with rising costs. His top-selling 'Special Ramen' is up 47%, selling for 1,250 yen ($8). 'Traditionally ramen shops were supposed to offer something cheap and tasty,' Hikage said between stirring big pots of broth and blanching noodles. 'It's no longer cheap food for the masses.' The problems facing ramen vendors - a record number of shop operators are set to go bankrupt this year - reflect a cost-of-living crunch that has become a top issue for voters in Japan's general election on Sunday. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, a self-described ramen fanatic, and opposition parties have pledged various measures to offset rising costs for businesses and households. Those efforts to control rising prices, in a land emerging from decades of deflation, could tip an election where opinion polls show the LDP - which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era - might lose its parliamentary majority. Hikage, who said he will be too busy working in his restaurant to vote, hopes the victors will consider introducing subsidies to offset rising costs. His award-winning noodles remain in demand despite the repeated price hikes, with long queues in front of his shop day and night. Some of his competitors are not faring so well: 49 ramen shop operators with debts of at least 10 million yen filed for bankruptcy in the first seven months of the year, on track to exceed the 2020 record of 54 bankruptcies, according to credit research firm Teikoku Databank. 'Weeded out' Hikage prides himself on using mostly domestic ingredients, but many ramen restaurants rely heavily on imported materials, like the flour to make noodles. Japan's import costs have risen as the yen has sunk. The currency hit a 34-year low against the dollar this year and has struggled to regain ground. Also boosting costs for ramen shops are higher energy and grain prices, triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as rising labor costs. The plight of Japan's ramen shops illustrates a larger trend, as companies that fail to adjust to the era of inflation go under. Nationwide bankruptcies in the six months to September jumped 18.6% from the same period last year to 4,990 cases, with a record number caused by inflation, said Teikoku Databank. 'Just like ramen shops, companies offering goods and services that are in demand are transferring costs to product prices and seeing their sales grow. Those struggling to pass on higher costs are being weeded out,' said Dai-ichi Life Research Institute's executive chief economist Toshihiro Nagahama. But Nagahama said politicians' tendency to dish out support measures to win votes may be counterproductive in the long term. 'If too many 'zombie' firms, or companies that cannot raise productivity or wages, are kept alive, they could be a drag on the Japanese economy,' he said. For now, Hikage said he will focus on serving quality dishes and hopes the election can bring some kind of positive change. 'Our task now is to endure this and focus on offering something delicious, with our heads bowed to customers,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-rising-ramen-prices-give-election-voters-food-for-thought/7836917.html	2024-10-23T23:32:10-07:00	
Detained Cambodian journalist seeks bail after apologizing for 'harmful' posts	An award-winning Cambodian journalist detained on charges of inciting social unrest sought bail on Thursday, his lawyer said, a day after the government released a video of the investigative reporter apologizing. Mech Dara, who is known for exposing corruption and human trafficking through his reporting, has been in pre-trial detention since Oct. 1, and faces up to two years in prison. His arrest has drawn concern from rights groups and the U.S. government. In its Oct. 1 decision, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court said Dara, who has worked for local and international media, had posted 'provocative' and 'false' messages and pictures about a rock quarry on a sacred mountain. Dara's lawyer, Duch Piseth, said the bail request had been made but it was too early to say if the charges would be dropped. 'We are just waiting for his release,' he said On Wednesday, Cambodia's information minister shared with journalists a video of Dara wearing prison garb and apologizing. It was accompanied by images of a handwritten three-page letter the minister said was from the journalist. 'In all the messages that I posted, I conveyed false information that affected the leaders and the country's reputation. I sincerely apologize for my mistakes and promise to stop sharing such harmful content,' Dara said in the video. Dara received a hero award last year from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, recognizing his work exposing the existence of massive scam compounds staffed mostly by trafficked workers in Cambodia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/detained-cambodian-journalist-seeks-bail-after-apologizing-for-harmful-posts/7836916.html	2024-10-23T23:22:32-07:00	
Russian drones target Kyiv region	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Thursday that Russia attacked the region with about a dozen aerial drones overnight. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said Ukraine’s air defenses shot down all of the drones and that there were no reports of casualties or damage. In the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine, Governor Vitalii Kim said on Telegram the military shot down three Russian drones. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed seven Ukrainian aerial drones, including four over the Kursk region and three over the Black Sea. Officials in Russia’s Bryansk region also reported several drones were shot down there overnight. North Korean troops The United States said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops were dispatched to Russia earlier this month and are being trained there, possibly to fight alongside Moscow’s troops in their war against Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters that what Pyongyang’s soldiers are doing in Russia is 'left to be seen.' White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. is 'working closely with our allies and partners to gain a full understanding of the situation.' Kirby said the North Korean troops traveled by ship between early October and mid-month from its Wonsan naval port to Vladivostok in Russia. Then, he said, the North Korean troops were dispatched to multiple military training sites in eastern Russia. 'We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military' in Ukraine, but the possibility is 'certainly a high concern,' Kirby said. 'We have briefed the Ukrainian government on our understanding of this situation, and we're certainly consulting closely with other allies, partners and countries in the region on the implications of such a dramatic group move, and on how we might respond,' Kirby said. 'For the time being, we will continue to monitor the situation closely, but let's be clear: If North Korean soldiers do enter into combat, this development will demonstrate Russia's growing desperation in its war against Ukraine,' Kirby added. 'Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield every single day, but President [Vladimir] Putin appears intent on continuing this war,' Kirby said. 'If Russia is indeed forced to turn to North Korea for manpower, if we assign a weakness, not strength, it would also demonstrate an unprecedented level of direct military cooperation between Russia and North Korea with security implications in Europe, as well as the Indo-Pacific,' he said. Kirby said Russia's cooperation with the North Korean military would violate multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting the procurement of arms from North Korea and military arms training. China, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council and a close ally of North Korea, was asked by VOA about its view of the U.S., South Korean, Ukrainian and NATO intelligence confirming the presence of North Korean troops in eastern Russia and the possible implications. 'China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for de-escalation and be committed to political settlement,' Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu, said in a statement. Defense chief Austin cited a 'strengthened relationship' between Russia and North Korea, noting that North Korea has provided weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. 'If they're co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe; it will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well,' Austin said. Austin also highlighted Russian casualties in the war it launched with a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, saying the North Korea development is an indication that Putin 'may be in even more trouble than most people realize.' Austin’s assessment was quickly backed up by NATO officials, who are awaiting additional briefings from South Korea, which went public with its intelligence on the North Korean troop movements last week. 'We are actively consulting within the Alliance on this matter,' NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah said, adding, 'If these troops are destined to fight in Ukraine, it would mark a significant escalation in North Korea’s support for Russia’s illegal war and yet another sign of Russia’s significant losses on the front lines.' VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

Commonwealth nations to discuss slavery reparations, climate change	APIA, SAMOA — The leaders of the Commonwealth group of nations will meet at a welcome banquet in Samoa in the South Pacific on Thursday, with climate change and reparations for Britain's role in the transatlantic slave trade on the agenda of summit discussions. Leaders and officials from 56 countries with roots in Britain's empire, as well as Britain's King Charles, are in the small island nation and attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began Monday. The countries' foreign ministers also began a day of discussions on Thursday. More than half of the Commonwealth's members are small states, many of which are low-lying island nations at risk from rising sea levels due to climate change. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said ocean temperatures are rising in the Pacific Islands at three times the rate worldwide, and its population is 'uniquely exposed' to the impact of rising sea levels. 'Climate change is an existential threat. It is the number one national security threat. It is the number one economic threat to the peoples of the Pacific and to many members of the Commonwealth,' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told a news conference after a meeting with counterparts. A number of African countries, including Zambia, warned the meeting about the escalating impacts of climate change, including the effects on food security, she added. On Thursday, Charles will be shown the impact of rising sea levels that are forcing people to move inland, a Samoan chief said. Island leaders are expected to issue a declaration on ocean protection at the summit, with climate change being a central topic of discussion. Reparations push Also on the agenda is a push for Britain to pay reparations for transatlantic slavery, a long-standing issue that has recently been gaining momentum worldwide, particularly those part of the Caribbean Community and more recently the African Union. British Prime Minister Kier Starmer said on Monday the UK will not bring the issue of reparations for historical transatlantic slavery to the table at the summit, but is open to engage with leaders who want to discuss it. CARICOM has set up a commission to seek reparations from former colonial powers such as the UK, France and Portugal. Those opposed to paying reparations say countries shouldn't be held responsible for historical wrongs, while those in favor say the legacy of slavery has resulted in persistent and vast racial inequalities today. A CARICOM source familiar with the matter told Reuters CHOGM presents an 'important opportunity' for dialogue on reparations and the region will be tabling the issue there. 'It is a priority for many of the Commonwealth's member countries and whenever those affected by atrocities ask to talk, there should always be a willingness to sit down and listen,' said Kingsley Abbott, director of the University of London's Institute of Commonwealth Studies, who is attending the summit. From the 15th to the 19th century, at least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported by European ships and merchants and sold into slavery. Those who survived the brutal voyage ended up toiling on plantations under inhumane conditions in the Americas, mostly in Brazil and the Caribbean, while others profited from their labor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/commonwealth-nations-to-discuss-slavery-reparations-climate-change/7836906.html	2024-10-23T22:03:57-07:00	
China space plan highlights commitment to space exploration, analysts say	Chinese officials recently released a 25-year space exploration plan that details five major scientific themes and 17 priority areas for scientific breakthroughs with one goal: to make China a world leader in space by 2050 and a key competitor with the U.S. in space, for decades to come. Last week, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China National Space Administration, and the China Manned Space Agency jointly released a space exploration plan for 2024 through 2050. It includes searching for extraterrestrial life, exploring Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, sending space crews to the moon and building an international lunar research station by 2025. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the plan highlights China’s long-term commitment and answers some lingering questions as well. 'I think a lot of experts have wondered if China would continue to invest in space, particularly in science and exploration, given a lot of economic uncertainties in China … but this is a sign that they're committed,' Swope said. The plan reinforces a 'commitment to really look at space science and exploration in the long term and not just short term,' he added. The plan outlines Beijing’s goal to send astronauts to the moon by 2030, obtain and retrieve the first samples from Mars and successfully complete a mission to the Jupiter system in the next few years. It also outlines three phases of development, each with specific goals in terms of space exploration and key scientific discoveries. The extensive plan is not only a statement that Beijing can compete with the U.S. in high-tech industries, it is also a way of boosting national pride, analysts say. 'Space in particular has a huge public awareness, public pride,' says Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired senior intelligence officer and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. 'It emboldens the Chinese people, gives them a strong sense of nationalism and superiority, and that's what the main focus of the Bejing government is.' Swope agrees. 'I think it's [China’s long-term space plan] a manifestation of China's interest and desire from a national prestige and honor standpoint to really show that it's a player on the international stage up there with the United States,' he said. Antonia Hmaidi, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA in an email response that, 'China’s space focus goes back to the 1960,' and that 'China has also been very successful at meeting its own goals and timelines.' In recent years China has carried out several successful space science missions including Chang’e-4, which marked the world’s first soft landing and roving on the far side of the moon, Change’e-5, a mission that returned a sample from the moon back to Beijing for the first time, and Tianwen-1, a space mission that resulted in Chinese spacecraft leaving imprints on Mars. In addition, to these space missions, Bejing has implemented several programs aimed at increasing scientific discovery relating to space, particularly through the launch of several space satellites. Since 2011, China has developed and launched scientific satellites including Dark Matter Particle Explorer, Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, and the Einstein Probe. While China continues to make progress with space exploration and scientific discovery, according to Swope, there is still a way to go before it catches up to the United States. 'China is undeniably the number 2 space power in the world today, behind the United States,' he said. 'The United States is still by far the most important in a lot of measures and metrics, including in science and exploration.' Eftimiades said one key reason the United States has maintained its lead in the space race is the success of Washington’s private, commercial aerospace companies. 'The U.S. private industry has got the jump on China,' Eftimiades said. 'There's no type of industrial control, industrial plan. In fact, Congress and administration shy away from that completely.' Unlike the United States, large space entities in China are often state-owned, such as the China Aerospace Cooperation, Eftimiades said. He adds that one advantage of China’s space entities being state-owned is the ability for the Chinese government to 'direct their industries toward specific objectives.' At the same time, having bureaucracy involved with state-owned enterprises leads to less 'cutting-edge technology.' This year, China has focused on growing its space presence relative to the U.S. by conducting more orbital launches. Beijing planned to conduct 100 orbital launches this year, according to the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, which was to conduct 70 of them. However, as of October 15, China had completed 48 orbital launches. Last week, SpaceX announced it had launched its 100th rocket of the year and had another liftoff just hours later. The private company is aiming for 148 launches this year. Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense implemented its first Commercial Space Integration Strategy, which outlined the department’s efforts to take technologies produced in the private sector and apply their uses for U.S. national security purposes. In a statement released relating to the U.S. strategic plan, the Department of Defense explained its strategy to work closely with private and commercial sector space companies that are known to be innovative and have scalable production. According to the statement, officials say 'the strategy is based on the premise that the commercial space sector's innovative capabilities, scalable production and rapid technology refresh rates provide pathways to enhance the resilience of DOD space capabilities and strengthen deterrence.' Many space technologies have military applications, Swope said. 'A lot of things that are done in space have a dual use, so [space technologies] may be primarily used for scientific purposes, but also could be used to design and build and test some type of weapons technology,' Swope said. Hmaidi says China’s newest space plan stands out for what it doesn’t have. 'The most interesting and striking part about China’s newest space plan to me was the narrow focus on basic science over military goals,' she told VOA in an email. 'However, we know from open-source research that China is also very active in military space development.' 'This plan contains only one part of China’s space planning, namely the part that is unlikely to have direct military utility, while not mentioning other missions with direct military utility like its low-earth orbit internet program,' Hmaidi explained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-space-plan-highlights-commitment-to-space-exploration-analysts-say/7836873.html	2024-10-23T19:55:53-07:00	
In Pakistan, polio workers persist despite perils	Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan's fight to eradicate polio is marked with hopeful highs and disappointing lows. As the global community marks World Polio Day on October 24, the nuclear-armed nation faces a staggering 39 cases so far this year, compared to six in 2023 and 20 the year before. In 2021, the South Asian nation briefly seemed on track to eradicating the paralytic virus, with just one reported case the entire year. Going door to door to vaccinate children 5 years old and younger against the poliovirus is a perilous task in Pakistan. Fozia Kalwar became a vaccinator three years ago. A resident of Pakistan's southern Sindh province, the 35-year-old widow took the part-time job because she needed the money. Kalwar makes less than $50 for a week of grueling work during vaccination drives. It is not nearly enough to feed her four children. And the reward is small, she said, for a job that comes with serious security risks. 'I feel very scared, but then I wonder how I will feed my children if I don't work,' Kalwar told VOA. She works in a dangerous part of Sindh, where armed bandits rob people in broad daylight. Still, it was the report of a sexual assault on a fellow polio worker last month that deeply disturbed her, she said. The victim, who lived a few streets away from Kalwar, was allegedly gang-raped by three men while in the field. Attacks on polio workers in Pakistan are largely limited to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Militants in the northern province often target polio teams, accusing them of partaking in a 'Western conspiracy' to render children infertile through the vaccine. They also claim the vaccine has pork-based ingredients that are forbidden for Muslims to consume. This year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, at least two vaccinators were killed and four wounded, while seven policemen providing security to polio teams died and 30 suffered injuries in four attacks. However, news of the alleged sexual assault in Sindh shocked many. After the incident, Kalwar said, many people in her area suggested shutting down the polio program. 'They said, 'It is saving our children, but what about our women?'' Kalwar told VOA. Watch related video by Murtaza Zehri and Abu Baker Alizai: Lack of trust Despite years of expensive awareness campaigns, many Pakistanis believe anti-vaccine propaganda and refuse the oral vaccine for their children. Lack of trust in the health care system drives others to shut the door on vaccinators. 'In posh areas where there are educated people with more awareness, they don't trust us much,' said Fiza Bibi, a supervisor for community health workers. 'They are very sensitive about their kids. They refuse the vaccine more often for their children,' said Bibi, who works in Karachi, the capital of Sindh. 'Even if they vaccinate their kids later, for us, the child is counted among refusals.' Sindh, Pakistan's southern and second most populated province, detected 12 polio cases this year, behind Balochistan, where 20 cases emerged. Karachi is home to eight districts considered high risk for the spread of the poliovirus. Experts blame overpopulation, poor hygiene and migration from across the country to the economic hub. Health officials say the challenging demographic landscape of Karachi complicates eradicating polio in the province. Sindh fared worse this year in case tally than Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north, which shares a long, busy border with Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries still grappling with the naturally occurring wild poliovirus. Afghanistan has detected 18 cases this year. Future outlook A nation of over 240 million people, Pakistan is gearing to launch a countrywide polio campaign from October 28. The drive will target 45 million children. According to Pakistan's polio eradication program, cases of the paralytic disease may rise. 'Given the widespread virus presence and its intensity of circulation, more cases are expected to emerge alongside environmental detections during next couple of months,' a program document explains. There is also some good news. The variants of the virus present in Pakistan have dropped from 11 in 2019 to two in 2024, according to the official report. 'This decline underscores the impact of targeted vaccination efforts and enhanced surveillance,' the document said. 'We should not be demoralized by the rising case numbers. We must keep up our efforts,' said Bibi. The 21-year-old was among three health workers chosen from across Pakistan to meet Bill Gates in June. The co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation visited Pakistan to discuss polio, among other issues, with top officials. Working in Sindh near Jacobabad, one of the hottest cities on the planet in the summer, Kalwar has a strategy to make sure no child misses the vaccine in the upcoming drive. 'In our areas, we now keep a register with every child's name in it so that no one is left out,' she said. 'When we visit, we ask about each child by name.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-pakistan-polio-workers-persist-despite-perils/7836830.html	2024-10-23T19:37:28-07:00	
China backs Russia-proposed BRICS payment system	WASHINGTON — Gathered Wednesday at a summit in the Russian city of Kazan, the members of BRICS adopted a joint declaration calling for the creation of an independent payment system based on their national currencies, a move in response to what they regard as illegal sanctions that are damaging the global economy. BRICS member countries, which account for about 35% of the global economy, issued the Kazan Declaration, which calls for the 'elimination' of 'unilateral economic sanctions and secondary sanctions that are contrary to international law.' The BRICS membership includes the initial five — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — and expanded when several countries joined this year, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates. Expressing concerns over 'unilateral coercive' sanctions that have 'disruptive effects' on the world economy, the BRICS members agreed to examine the 'establishment of an independent cross-border settlement and depository infrastructure, BRICS Clear.' In supporting 'inclusive cross-border payment instruments,' they encouraged the 'use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners.' Edward Fishman, senior research scholar at Columbia University and author of the forthcoming book 'Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,' said, 'The BRICS have finally found a unifying mission: circumventing American financial dominance.' 'For BRICS members under U.S. sanctions, namely Russia and Iran, this mission is already a top national priority,' he said. 'Others such as China see it as a handy way to insulate themselves from potential sanctions in the future.' Fishman said the United States should take BRICS initiatives 'seriously and move to further solidify the dollar's advantages' as they 'could well bear fruit over the next decade,' although 'it's unlikely that any of these initiatives will make a dent in the dollar's global role in the near future.' Circumventing US dollar In his speech at the summit Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said 'the reform of the international financial architecture' is 'pressing,' and he called for 'the connectivity' of financial infrastructure among BRICS members and the expansion of the New Development Bank, or NDB. Headquartered in Shanghai, the NDB was established by the initial five BRICS members in 2015. It serves as an alternative financial institution to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Tom Keatinge, the founding director of the Center for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute, said China would be inclined to join the new financial system that Russia is advocating. He said Beijing's reasons are twofold: 'to influence its design to ensure it can benefit' and 'to add to its desire to provide counterbalance to the historically unipolar financial system dominated by the United States.' Keatinge added, however, that the new infrastructure would not be able to easily replicate 'the stability, liquidity and convertibility of the U.S. dollar' that a number of other existing bilateral and multilateral payment systems experience. VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington whether and why Beijing is interested in joining and using the proposed BRICS financial system but did not get a reply. Citing unnamed experts, China's state-run Global Times on October 17 said an alternative payment system 'may help reduce excessive reliance on the U.S. dollar.' Sanctions evasion BRICS' efforts to increase the use of local currencies are seen as a bid to challenge the global financial system dominated by the U.S. dollar, which accounts for 90% of all currency trading and more than half of international payments. At the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, 'The dollar is being used as a weapon.' He also said the increased use of BRICS national currencies for transactions will 'minimize geopolitical risks.' During a meeting with Putin at the summit on Tuesday, NDB President Dilma Rousseff said the bank was committed to financing the countries of the Global South in their national currencies. Russian state development corporation and investment company VER.RF signed agreements with China and South Africa to extend credit lines in national currencies, Russian news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. BRICS Clear, the international payment and deposit platform to ensure increased circulation of national currencies, was proposed by Russia ahead of the summit. The Russian Financial Ministry, central bank and consulting firm Yakov and Partners earlier in October issued a document proposing BRICS Clear as a platform that would utilize national depository systems 'independent of third-party influence.' Also ahead of the summit, a new cross-border payment system called BRICS Pay was introduced at the BRICS Business Forum held in Moscow on October 17 and 18. A statement released Tuesday by the American Action Forum, citing an analysis by Jacob Jensen, a data analyst at the think tank, said there are concerns that BRICS Pay would allow participating countries to 'circumvent USD as a payment intermediary by replacing it with blockchain technology and an alternative to the SWIFT financial payment system.' Several Russian banks were banned from the SWIFT messaging system that facilitates global financial transfers shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovsaid on Wednesday that the BRICS is not trying to create a system as an alternative to SWIFT, according to Russian TASS. Despite BRICS' efforts, no country using an alternative system like BRICS Pay will be immune from sanctions, as such a payment system can be subject to sanctions, said David Asher, a Hudson Institute senior fellow who advised the U.S. government over several years on sanctions evasion schemes. Ultimately, Asher said, national and digital currencies will end up being swapped into U.S. dollars at the Clearing House Automated Transfer System based in Hong Kong, which he believes should be sanctioned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backs-russia-proposed-brics-payment-system-/7836865.html	2024-10-23T19:19:29-07:00	
Ukrainians reflect on Zelenskyy’s victory plan	Kyiv’s victory plan, presented this month by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has already received assessments from the country’s Western partners. But what do Ukrainian civilians and experts think about it?

Analysis: China, Russia, North Korea and Iran described as new ‘Axis of Evil’ by some	WASHINGTON — U.S. officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the emerging partnership among China, Russia, Iran and North Korea – a bloc being talked about by some in Washington as a new 'axis of evil.' Those worries got a major boost on Wednesday with confirmation by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a trip to Rome that North Korean troops are now present in Russia, presumably preparing to participate in Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Just days earlier, Russia was a participant in naval drills hosted by Iran. China, North Korea and Iran all have supported Russia's war machine in different ways during its war on Ukraine. Iran has provided missiles and drones. North Korea has sent artillery shells. And China has provided dual-use technology and industrial products, including semiconductors and drone engines. 'We've seen the emergence of Axis of Evil back in the late 1930s, 1938, 1939. We saw what the world did at that particular point to come together,' said Republican congressman Rob Wittman, vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during an online discussion last month hosted by the Center for a New American Security. 'We find ourselves at that same crossroads today where we have nations that do not believe in the same things that we believe in, do not believe in the rule of law, do not believe in protecting the rights and dignity of human beings.' In 2002, former U.S. President George W. Bush used the term 'axis of evil' in his State of the Union address to describe countries supporting terrorism, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq. More recently, it is being applied in Washington to describe China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken describes these four countries as revisionist powers. He wrote that a fierce competition to define a new era of international affairs is under way, and a few countries are determined to change the basic principles of the international system. 'While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome,' Blinken wrote in the November/December issue of the publication Foreign Affairs. Wittman does use the term 'Axis of Evil' and said the countries involved are more capable of destabilizing the world than were Nazi Germany and its allies in 1939, especially as they cooperate and share technology at all levels. 'So, as you look at drones that have been taken out in Ukraine, you find Chinese printed circuit boards in there, Chinese systems on board those drones,' Wittman told VOA. 'You also see the arms that are being fired into Ukraine from Russian artillery pieces are being manufactured in North Korea. You see the drones that are being used by Russians in the battle space there are being manufactured by Iran.' He also said the new partnership is learning from the Ukrainian war at a rate that keeps pace with the times, gaining capabilities that cannot be achieved in normal testing and development processes in a peaceful environment. 'The biggest difference in the 2024 Axis of Evil is that at least three of the four countries are in expansionist mode,' wrote Merrill Matthews, resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation earlier this year. 'They want much more land and power. And they are coordinating their efforts to benefit each country’s goals. It’s a very dangerous development.' Matthews told VOA this group is working to create a largely self-sufficient economic zone — out of both necessity and desire — that does not rely on Western economies for survival. Christopher S. Chivvis, a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told VOA that China is key to the strength of the four-way relationship. 'If China were not part of this four, it would look like three countries that are highly isolated from the world cooperating with each other. We would have much less to worry about. It's China's participation in this grouping that is really has the potential to make it very problematic for the United States,' he said. Chivvis added that the four countries can use a crisis in one region to launch a war, coordinate actions, or create chaos in another. For example, Chivvis lays out a more extreme version of this scenario in his recent report — were China to attempt a military operation against Taiwan, Russia might seek to take advantage of the strain on U.S. resources with an even more aggressive military campaign in Ukraine or even with an incursion into NATO territory. Similarly, a major escalation with Iran in the Middle East that draws in more U.S. naval and air forces could also embolden China to take a more aggressive approach to Taiwan. 'It would be difficult for these four countries to sign a formal treaty that would commit them to doing that kind of thing, but you can see it emerging spontaneously or organically out of a crisis situation,' Chivvis said. And a crisis in one region can spill over to another part of the world. 'If you look at, for example, the Gulf Arab states, they're critical energy suppliers to both China and Taiwan,' said Michael Singh, managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'If you look at Iran, Iran has the capabilities we've seen through proxies like the Houthis to disrupt international waterways. So, to think that a conflict over Taiwan will be restricted to the Indo-Pacific is, I think at this stage, simply naive and ignoring.' Blinken describes the relationship among the four countries as 'largely transactional,' adding that their cooperation 'entails tradeoffs and risks that each may find more distasteful over time.' 'And yet all four revisionists share an abiding commitment to the overarching objective of challenging the United States and the international system,' Blinken wrote. 'That will continue to drive their cooperation, especially as the United States and other countries stand up to their revisionism.' Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysis-china-russia-north-korea-and-iran-described-as-new-axis-of-evil-by-some/7836853.html	2024-10-23T18:40:45-07:00	
US lawmakers label Pakistan's governance 'military rule with civilian facade'	Islamabad, Pakistan — More than 60 members of Congress wrote to President Joe Biden on Wednesday, urging his intervention 'to secure the release of political prisoners' in Pakistan, including former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The letter stated that in February, the Pakistani parliamentary elections saw a historic level of irregularities, including widespread electoral fraud, state-led efforts to disenfranchise voters, and the arrest and detention of political leaders, journalists and activists. The U.S. lawmakers echoed calls for Khan's immediate release and an end to the widespread arbitrary detention of supporters of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. 'At a minimum, we ask your administration to urgently secure the guarantees from the Pakistani government for Khan's safety and well-being and urge U.S. Embassy officials to visit him in prison,' the letter to Biden read. The American lawmakers expressed their concern about what they denounced as the 'ongoing widespread human rights violations' in Pakistan following the country's parliamentary elections. 'More broadly, developments since the February vote point to a clear turn towards authoritarianism in the country,' the letter said. '… Simply put, Pakistan's current system amounts to 'military rule with civilian facade.' ' The representatives noted that the Pakistani government also has intensified its crackdown on social media and the internet as part of a broader effort to suppress political activism and pressure journalists. The letter was written by Representative Greg Casar; Representatives Jim McGovern and Summer Lee are co-leaders of the group. The letter describes Khan, 72, as a political leader in Pakistan 'with widespread support in the country.' There was no immediate reaction to the letter from the White House, nor have Pakistani officials commented on it. Khan has been imprisoned since August 2023 on multiple allegations, including corruption and inciting violence against military facilities. He denies any wrongdoing. In June, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 368-7 to urge 'the full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities' in the February polls in Pakistan. Islamabad strongly objected to the resolution, saying it 'stems from an incomplete understanding of the political situation and electoral process' in the South Asian nation. Khan, the cricket star-turned-prime minister, was ousted from power in 2022 through an opposition parliamentary vote of no confidence. The move, which the deposed leader rejected as illegal, led to unprecedented political turmoil in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a country of more than 240 million people. The deposed leader accused the military of orchestrating his removal and initiated numerous lawsuits subsequently. The legal challenges, which Khan rejects as politically motivated, have prevented him from pursuing public office. His party was also subjected to a state crackdown and eventually prohibited from participating in the February election. Khan and independent critics maintain the vote was rigged to allow pro-military parties to secure victory, allegations Sharif and military officials denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-label-pakistan-s-governance-military-rule-with-civilian-facade-/7836522.html	2024-10-23T18:06:36-07:00	
US Justice Department warns Musk's super PAC over $1 million giveaways	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department has sent a letter to Elon Musk's super PAC warning that the billionaire Tesla CEO's $1 million giveaways may violate federal law, several media organizations reported on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. A letter from the department's public integrity section, which investigates potential election-related law violations, went to the PAC. The Justice Department and Musk's America PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. South African-born Musk, who has thrown his support behind Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ahead of the November 5 election, announced on Saturday while speaking before a crowd in Pennsylvania that he was giving away $1 million each day until Election Day to someone who signs his online petition supporting the U.S. Constitution. He handed $1 million checks to two separate people over the weekend — one to a man in Harrisburg on Saturday and another to a woman in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump's bid to regain the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-warns-musk-s-super-pac-over-1-million-giveaways/7836813.html	2024-10-23T17:03:54-07:00	
Humanitarian aid workers face 'increasingly difficult' conditions	The president of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has announced the establishment of the Red Family Fund to honor humanitarian aid workers who have died in the line of duty. Kate Forbes told the organization's general assembly in Geneva that aid workers find themselves working under 'increasingly difficult' conditions that include not only an escalation in conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere but also a decrease in observance of international law. 'Global conflicts have escalated, endangering civilians and our volunteers, making it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid,' Forbes said. So far this year, 30 of the group's 16 million humanitarian aid workers worldwide have died in the line of duty, she said. 'The surge in violence against humanitarian workers underscores a decline in the adherence to international humanitarian law and poses a direct threat to our mission,' the IFRC president said. She described each loss as a deep wound but said the deaths would not weaken the organization's 'resolve to directly address these crises.' Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the gathering that humanitarian workers find themselves doing their jobs across the globe amid a world shaped by 'armed conflicts and political turmoil.' The Red Family Fund, according to the IFRC's website, honors volunteers and staff from the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies 'who die in the line of duty and provides a mechanism for one-time financial assistance to the families they leave behind.' 'This is a tangible step that demonstrates our commitment to honor those who care for others,' Forbes said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-aid-workers-face-increasingly-difficult-conditions-/7836527.html	2024-10-23T16:37:17-07:00	
Pakistan's weapons programs face scrutiny after US curbs	islamabad — The latest U.S.-imposed restrictions on entities supporting Pakistan's defense programs may hinder Islamabad's future efforts to acquire sensitive defense technologies and its collaboration with China but are unlikely to affect Pakistan’s weapons development for now, experts say. Sixteen Pakistani firms were among 26 international companies added this week to a U.S, 'entities list,' making them ineligible to acquire U.S. items and technology without government authorization. Companies or individuals can be placed on the list if they are 'involved or pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,' according to a U.S. Commerce Department statement. Nine of the 16 Pakistani companies added to the blacklist this week were accused of being front companies for a previously sanctioned company, Advanced Engineering Research Organization, deemed responsible for the country's cruise missile and strategic drone programs. The remaining seven entities were added for contributions to Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, the Commerce Department statement said. Other companies added to the list this week were accused of procuring U.S.-made items with military applications for China, Iran, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Defense analysts told VOA that addition to the list is unlikely to slow Pakistan’s missile program, which has continued despite multiple rounds of U.S. curbs on entities supporting it. 'It will not make a difference to Pakistan,' said Pakistani defense analyst Salman Javed, who acknowledged that the country relies on the United States for other defense technology needs. 'I believe Pakistan's missile program is in an advanced stage, and U.S. restrictions will have no impact on it.' Former Pakistani army General Talat Masood said Pakistan has looked more to China than the United States for 'the expertise and technology' needed to advance its drone program. But he said the new curbs might affect Pakistan’s future collaboration with China in the field of drones and their sale to other countries. Pakistan has not officially responded to the latest restrictions but objected last month when Washington blacklisted four companies, three Chinese and one Pakistani, for 'knowingly' transferring prohibited equipment to Pakistan. Islamabad said the sanctions were imposed 'without any evidence whatsoever.' Syed Irfan Ashraf, an assistant professor at the University of Peshawar in Pakistan, said the United States has long prevented arms technology sales in black markets to protect its interests. 'However, the timing and scrutiny of entities supporting Pakistan right now is crucial' because of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. In September, the U.S. State Department acted against five entities and one individual — all but one Chinese — that were involved in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and controlled missile equipment and technology to Pakistan. Salman Ali, a Pakistani scholar at the School of Politics at the Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, said the recent wave of U.S. sanctions represents a distinct shift from the usual regulatory measures observed since Pakistan's de facto nuclearization and are aimed more at pressuring China. 'Over the past six rounds of U.S. curbs, it's clear that the focus has been on the technical exchanges between China and Pakistan. These sanctions are not only intended to curb the rapid advancement of missile and drone programs but are also seen as a strategy to pressure China,' Ali told VOA. Pakistan and Iran are both members of the China-led regional alliance Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which opposed the unilateral sanctions in its recently concluded summit October 16 in Islamabad.

For Tibetan political leader, 'Middle Way' to autonomy is still core focus	Prague/Washington — In the lobby of an upscale hotel in Prague, Sikyong Penpa Tsering talked about death — specifically, the eventuality that China's Xi Jinping will one day die. 'Nothing is permanent. Even our life is not permanent. We are born, and we have to die. So even empires rise and fall. Governments rise and fall. Xi Jinping will also have to die. So, these are inevitable,' said Tsering, leader of Tibet's exiled government, the Central Tibetan Administration. He said it casually, matter-of-factly, as if he wasn't talking about the potential downfall of the world's second-most powerful government and the inevitable death of its powerful leader. 'China is going to change. It has to change. There is no other choice,' Tsering told VOA last week on the sidelines of the Forum 2000 democracy conference in the Czech capital Prague. Sitting on a leather chair and wearing a black Tibetan vest and a blue button-down shirt, Tsering spoke about how this fundamental Buddhist idea of impermanence gives him hope for his homeland. Reports say abuse has increased China annexed Tibet in 1950, and since then human rights abuses in the region have steadily grown, according to reports from the U.S. State Department and rights groups. Beijing claims the region has been part of China since 'ancient times.' It views the Central Tibetan Administration, or CTA, as a separatist organization and says that no government should allow the Dalai Lama — the spiritual and one-time political leader of Tibet — to visit. But for Tsering, under the Buddhist concept of impermanence, everything in life — even Beijing's power and repression — is transient. Although Tsering's hope abounds, so does his pragmatism. The prospect of an improved human rights landscape and more autonomy remains far-off. It doesn't help that the CTA and Beijing barely have an open communication channel, Tsering said. 'Even if we manage to re-establish contact, there's no possibility of anything really coming out of it,' Tsering said. For now, the backchannel dialogue is for the long term, not the short term, the democratically elected leader added. But in an ideal world, where Beijing was willing to engage with the CTA, among the top priorities would be human rights in Tibet, as well as the Middle Way Approach — the Tibet administration policy that would give the region increased autonomy while remaining part of China. Those are among the issues Tsering sought to raise with political and civil society leaders at Forum 2000, an annual gathering on democracy human rights issues founded by former Czech President Vaclav Havel. Advocating for 'Middle Way' Although based in India, Tsering frequently travels the world to make his case for the Tibetan people. But he feels a particular kinship with the Czech Republic and other countries in Europe that once suffered under communism. 'They have experienced what our people are going through now,' Tsering said. 'That makes it easier for them to understand.' Tsering has about one and a half years left in his five-year term. He said he hasn't decided whether he'll pursue a second term, but one of his priorities for the next 18 months is to advocate for the Middle Way Approach. The Middle Way Approach accepts Tibet's status as part of China but advocates for increased autonomy, like greater freedoms for religion, language and culture. It's an attempt to balance Beijing's concerns about Tibetan separatism and Tibetans' concerns about cultural preservation. Tsering said he doesn't really understand why Beijing appears to be so opposed to the approach, since it doesn't call for independence. 'Dying a slow death culturally' For years, reports from news outlets and rights groups have detailed Beijing's grave rights abuses in Tibet. Chinese authorities are particularly repressive of any signs of dissent among Tibetans in the region, with more than 5,600 political prisoners formerly or currently jailed in Tibet since 1990, according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. Expressions of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan cultural identity are also restricted. 'We are dying a slow death culturally, because China is squeezing us out of our breath like a python, squeezing it out, slowly but surely,' Tsering said. Authorities have repressed the use of the Tibetan language, and the United Nations estimates that around 1 million children have been forcibly separated from families and sent to state-run boarding schools to assimilate into the dominant Han-Chinese culture. 'It's very clear that the Chinese government seeks to essentially hollow out and erase Tibetans' identities,' Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford and the former China director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA. China's Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's email requesting comment for this story. Other human rights issues include Beijing's harassment of exiled Tibetan journalists and activists in a process known as transnational repression. 'It's essentially to prevent anybody from hearing an alternative version of their story or critique of their version. The Chinese government wants everybody to believe its version of history,' Richardson said. But when it comes to transnational repression, Tsering said he isn't a target. 'They don't threaten me because they know it doesn't make sense. I won't listen. If they threaten me, I'll be much worse,' Tsering said. 'If they ask me not to do something, I do it more because I know it hurts them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/for-tibetan-political-leader-a-middle-way-to-autonomy-is-still-core-focus/7836462.html	2024-10-23T16:00:24-07:00

Tensions grip Bangladesh as student protesters demand president's resignation	DHAKA, BANGLADESH — Political tension in Bangladesh grew Wednesday after a leading student group called for the country's figurehead president to resign over his comments that appeared to call into question former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation in August. The interim government was expected to hold a Cabinet meeting to discuss the issue Thursday, while student protesters accused President Mohammed Shahabuddin of collaborating with Hasina's 'fascist' regime. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement set a two-day deadline for Shahabuddin to step down. Hundreds of protesters rallied in the capital, Dhaka, on Tuesday and into Wednesday while others attempted to storm the presidential palace. Police and witnesses said security officials used stun grenades to disperse people. Shahabuddin told a Bengali-language newspaper earlier this week that he had not seen Hasina's resignation letter as she fled to India in August during a student-led uprising. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took power and formed a government after Hasina stepped down on August 5. Shahabuddin told the Manab Zamin daily that he only heard about Hasina's resignation but had not seen the letter, saying he tried to collect it 'many times but failed.' He added: 'Maybe she did not have the time.' The statement infuriated the Yunus-led government and student activists. It contradicted Shahabuddin's address to the nation on August 5, when he said he had received the letter. Under Bangladesh's constitution, an elected prime minister must submit his or her resignation in writing to the president. Shahabuddin was appointed to the post by parliament after Hasina was elected prime minister for a fourth consecutive term in January. Shahabuddin dissolved parliament before the interim government took power on August 8. Asif Nazrul, the country's law adviser, recently accused Shahabuddin of spreading falsehoods and questioned if he was fit to remain in office. Experts said the resignation or removal of the president could create a constitutional vacuum. Under the constitution, only parliament can impeach the president. A senior leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is led by Hasina's main rival and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, met with Yunus on Wednesday. 'If the associates of the fallen autocracy attempt to create any constitutional and political crisis, the pro-democracy and agitating political parties and different organizations will deal with it unitedly,' Nazrul Islam Khan, a standing committee member of the party, told reporters. Also on Wednesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs in a notice banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League, an influential student wing of Hasina's Bangladesh Awami League party, with immediate effect, saying the government made the decision following the country's Anti-Terrorism Act. The notice said the government has evidence that the 76-year-old student body has been involved in 'subversive' activities against the state since Hasina stepped down. It did not share the evidence. The decision came a day after the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement issued a seven-day ultimatum to the government to ban the group. Hasina is now in India, but the Yunus-led government has said it would seek her expatriation to try her for alleged crimes against humanity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tensions-grip-bangladesh-as-student-protesters-demand-president-s-resignation/7836343.html	2024-10-23T13:01:13-07:00

Ex WH chief of staff: Trump wanted generals like Hitler's and said Nazi leader 'did some good things’	Washington — Donald Trump's longest-serving chief of staff is warning that the Republican presidential nominee meets the definition of a fascist and that while in office, Trump suggested that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.' The comments from John Kelly, the retired Marine general who worked for Trump in the White House from 2017 to 2019, came in interviews published Tuesday in The New York Times and The Atlantic. They build on past warnings from former top Trump officials as the election enters its final two weeks. Kelly has long been critical of Trump and previously accused him of calling veterans killed in combat 'suckers' and 'losers.' His new warnings emerged as Trump seeks a second term vowing to dramatically expand his use of the military at home and suggesting he would use force to go after Americans he considers 'enemies from within.' 'He commented more than once that, 'You know, Hitler did some good things, too,'' Kelly recalled to the Times. Kelly said he would usually quash the conversation by saying 'nothing (Hitler) did, you could argue, was good,' but that Trump would occasionally bring up the topic again. In his interview with the Atlantic, Kelly recalled that when Trump raised the idea of needing 'German generals,' Kelly would ask if he meant 'Bismarck's generals,' referring to Otto von Bismarck, the chancellor who oversaw the unification of Germany. 'Surely you can't mean Hitler's generals,' Kelly recalled asking Trump. To which the former president responded, 'Yeah, yeah, Hitler's generals.' Trump's campaign denied the accounts Tuesday, with campaign spokesman Steven Cheung saying that Kelly had 'beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated.' Polls show the race is tight in swing states, and both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are crisscrossing the country making their final pitches to the sliver of undecided voters. Harris' campaign has spent considerable time reaching out to independent voters, using the support of longtime Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney and comments like Kelly's to urge past Trump voters to reject his candidacy in November. Harris' campaign held a call with reporters Tuesday to elevate the voices of retired military officials who highlighted how many of the officials who worked with Trump now oppose his campaign. 'People that know him best are most opposed to him, his presidency,' said retired Army Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson. Anderson said he wished Kelly would fully back Harris over Trump, something he has yet to do. But retired Army reserve Col. Kevin Carroll, a former senior counselor to Kelly, said Wednesday that the former top Trump official would 'rather chew broken glass than vote for Donald Trump.' Before serving as Trump's chief of staff, Kelly worked as the former president's secretary of homeland security, where he oversaw Trump's attempts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Kelly was also at the forefront of the Trump administration's crackdown in immigration policy that led to the separation of thousands of immigrant parents and their children along the southern border. Those actions made him a villain to many on the left, including Harris. Kelly is not the first former top Trump administration official to cast the former president as a threat. Retired Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, who served as Trump's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bob Woodward in his recent book 'War' that Trump was 'fascist to the core' and 'the most dangerous person to this country.' And retired Gen. Jim Mattis, who worked as secretary of defense under Trump, reportedly later told Woodward that he agreed with Milley's assessment. Throughout Trump's political rise, the businessman-turned-politician benefited from the support of military veterans. AP VoteCast found that about 6 in 10 military veterans said they voted for Trump in 2020, as did just over half of those with a veteran in the household. Among voters in this year's South Carolina Republican primary, AP VoteCast found that close to two-thirds of military veterans and people in veteran households voted for Trump over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's toughest opponent in the 2024 Republican primary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-wh-chief-of-staff-trump-wanted-generals-like-hitler-s-and-said-nazi-leader-did-some-good-things-/7836221.html	2024-10-23T11:38:41-07:00	
Border arrests fall in September, last monthly gauge before US elections	San Diego — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico fell 7% in September to a more than four-year low, authorities said Tuesday. It was likely the last monthly gauge during a presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Donald Trump has made immigration a signature issue. The Border Patrol made 53,858 arrests, down from 58,009 in August and the lowest tally since August 2020, when arrests totaled 47,283, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Mexicans accounted for nearly half of the arrests, becoming a greater part of the mix. In December, when arrests reached an all-time high of 250,000, Mexicans made up fewer than 1 in 4. Arrests for other major nationalities seen at the border, including Guatemalans, Hondurans, Colombians and Ecuadoreans, have plunged this year. San Diego was again the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in September, followed by El Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona. For the government's fiscal year that ended on September 30, the Border Patrol made 1.53 million arrests after topping 2 million in each of the previous two years for the first time. The White House touted the numbers as proof that severe asylum restrictions introduced in June were having the intended effect, and blamed congressional Republicans for opposing a border security bill that failed in February. Vice President Kamala Harris has used that line of attack against Trump to try to blunt criticism that the Biden administration has been weak on immigration enforcement. 'The Biden Harris administration has taken effective action, and Republican officials continue to do nothing,' said White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a frequent administration critic and advocate for immigration restrictions, attributed recent declines to more enforcement by Mexican officials within their own borders, saying the White House 'essentially outsourced U.S. border security to Mexico in advance of the 2024 election — policies that can be reversed at any time that the government of Mexico chooses.' Arrests fell sharply after Mexico increased enforcement in December, and took a steeper dive after the U.S. asylum restrictions took effect in June. U.S. officials have not been shy about highlighting Mexico's role. Mexican authorities are encountering more migrants this year while deportations remain relatively low, creating a bottleneck. Panamanian authorities reported an increase in migrants walking through the notorious Darien Gap during September, though numbers are still well below last year. Troy Miller, acting CBP commissioner, said last week that the administration is working with Mexico and other countries to jointly address migration. 'We continue to be concerned about any bottlenecks, we continue to look at those, we continue to address them with our partners,' Miller said at a news conference in San Diego. The Biden administration has promoted new and expanded legal pathways to enter the country in an effort to discourage illegal crossings. In September, CBP allowed more than 44,600 people to enter with appointments on an online system called CBP One, bringing the total to 852,000 since it was introduced in January 2023. Another Biden policy allows up to 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela with financial sponsors to enter monthly through airports. More than 531,000 people from those four countries have entered that way up through September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7836194.html	2024-10-23T11:22:59-07:00

Fernando Valenzuela, Mexican-born pitcher whose feats for Dodgers fueled 'Fernandomania,' dies at 63	LOS ANGELES — Fernando Valenzuela, the Mexican-born phenom for the Los Angeles Dodgers who inspired 'Fernandomania' while winning the NL Cy Young Award and Rookie of the Year in 1981, has died. He was 63. The team said he died Tuesday night at a Los Angeles hospital but did not provide the cause or other details. His death comes as the Dodgers prepare to open the World Series on Friday night at home against the New York Yankees. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Valenzuela would be honored during the series at Dodger Stadium. Valenzuela left his color commentator job on the Dodgers' Spanish-language television broadcast in September without explanation. He was reported to have been hospitalized earlier this month. His job kept him as a regular at Dodger Stadium, where he held court in the press box dining room before games and remained popular with fans who sought him out for photos and autographs. 'God bless Fernando Valenzuela!' actor and Dodgers fan Danny Trejo posted on X. Valenzuela was one of the most dominant players of his era and a wildly popular figure in the 1980s, although he was never elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. However, he is part of Cooperstown, which features several artifacts including a signed ball from his no-hitter in 1990. 'He is one of the most influential Dodgers ever and belongs on the Mount Rushmore of franchise heroes,' Stan Kasten, team president and CEO, said in a statement. 'He galvanized the fan base with the Fernandomania season of 1981 and has remained close to our hearts ever since, not only as a player but also as a broadcaster. He has left us all too soon.' Valenzuela's rise from humble beginnings as the youngest of 12 children in Mexico and his feats on the mound made him hugely popular and influential in Los Angeles' Latino community while helping attract new fans to Major League Baseball. Their fondness for him continued after his retirement. '63 is way too young.... A piece of my childhood is gone,' actor and Access Hollywood co-host Mario Lopez posted on X. 'Growing up as a Mexican kid one of the main reasons I'm a Dodgers fan is because of Fernando. ... Not only a great player, but a great man to the community. What a legend.' Eva Torres, who is originally from Mexico City, drove from Anaheim to look at murals of Valenzuela on Sunset Boulevard near Dodgers Stadium. 'I wasn't a fan of baseball, but I am a fan of his,' she said. 'He's like me: an immigrant that came here to do great things.' In 1981, Valenzuela became the Dodgers' opening day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his scheduled start. He shut out the Houston Astros 2-0 and began the season 8-0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. He became the first player to win a Cy Young and Rookie of the Year in the same season. His performances created the delirium known as 'Fernandomania' among Dodgers fans. The ABBA hit Fernando would play as he warmed up on the mound. 'Fernando Valenzuela was a true icon of the Dodgers and the game,' U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California posted on X. 'His legacy and connection with the Latino community in LA is one of the reasons I fell in love with the Dodgers.' Valenzuela was 13-7 and had a 2.48 ERA in his first season, which was shortened by a players' strike. He was an All-Star selection every year from 1981-86, when he recorded 97 victories, 84 complete games, 1,258 strikeouts and a 2.97 ERA. He was 5-1 with a 2.00 ERA in eight postseason starts. He earned two Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove. Valenzuela's no-hitter on June 29, 1990, a 6-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, was an emotional career highlight. He struck out seven and walked three. 'If you have a sombrero, throw it to the sky!' Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully exclaimed in his game call. Nicknamed 'El Toro' by the fans, Valenzuela had an unorthodox and memorable pitching motion that included looking skyward at the apex of each windup. His repertoire included a screwball — making him one of the few pitchers of his era who threw that pitch regularly. It was taught to him by teammate Bobby Castillo after the Dodgers felt Valenzuela, who wasn't known as a hard thrower, needed another pitch. Early in his Dodgers career, Valenzuela spoke little English and had trouble communicating with his catchers. Rookie Mike Scioscia learned Spanish and became Valenzuela's personal catcher before becoming the team's full-time catcher. Valenzuela was a better-than-average hitter, with 10 career home runs. Eventually, his pitching was compromised by nagging shoulder problems that kept him out of the 1988 postseason, when the Dodgers won the World Series. The team released Valenzuela just before the 1991 season. He also pitched for the former California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals. He retired in 1997, going 173-153 with a 3.54 ERA in 17 seasons, the all-time major league leader in wins and strikeouts (2,074) by a Mexican-born player. In 11 seasons with the Dodgers, he was 141-116 with a 3.31 ERA. After retiring from MLB, Valenzuela remained active in Mexico's winter league. He played for the Aguilas de Mexicali in the Pacific League until he was 44. He retired on Dec. 20, 2006. 'We regret the passing of a Mexican baseball legend, his legacy will remain forever in our league and in the heart of our fans,' the league said in a statement. The baseball summer league as well other sports entities in Mexico, including the Mexican Soccer Federation and the National Sports Commission, also mourned his death. 'I think we, all Mexicans, are sad for the Valenzuela loss, and we express our solidarity with his family,' new Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said at her daily news conference. Valenzuela is not only considered Mexico's greatest baseball player, but he also is widely considered one of its top three athletes of all time, along with soccer player Hugo Sanchez and boxer Julio Cesar Chavez. 'It's a sad night. The news has shocked me, my soul and my spirit, it's a tremendous loss,' said Sanchez, now a sports analyst for ESPN. 'He was a symbol for Mexican sports during a historic moment.' Valenzuela's rise from his tiny hometown of Etchohuaquila in the Mexican state of Sonora to stardom in the U.S. was improbable. He was the youngest child in a large family who tagged along when his older brothers played baseball. He signed his first pro contract at age 16, and soon began overpowering older players in the Mexican Central League. In 1978, legendary Dodgers scout Mike Brito was in Mexico to watch a shortstop when Valenzuela entered the game as a reliever. He immediately commanded Brito's attention and at age 18, Valenzuela signed with the Dodgers in 1979. He was sent to the California League that same year. In 1980, Valenzuela was called up to the Dodgers in September and soon made his big league debut as a reliever. He remains the only pitcher in MLB history to win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The left-hander was the National League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game in 1981, the same year the Dodgers won the World Series. During his career, he made the cover of Sports Illustrated and visited the White House. In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers as the Spanish-language radio color commentator for NL games. Twelve years later, he switched to the color commentator job on the team's Spanish-language TV feed. 'He consistently supported the growth of the game through the World Baseball Classic and at MLB events across his home country,' Manfred said in a statement. 'As a member of the Dodger broadcasting team for more than 20 years, Fernando helped to reach a new generation of fans and cultivate their love of the game. Fernando will always remain a beloved figure in Dodger history and a special source of pride for the millions of Latino fans he inspired.' He was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014. Five years later, the Mexican League retired Valenzuela's No. 34 jersey. The Dodgers followed in 2023 after keeping his number out of circulation since he last pitched for the team in 1991. The team has a rule that requires a player to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame before the Dodgers retire his number, but they made an exception for Valenzuela. The Dodgers named Valenzuela as part of the 'Legends of Dodger Baseball' in 2019 and inducted him into the team's Ring of Honor in 2023. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. Valenzuela served on the coaching staff for Mexico during the World Baseball Classic in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2017. He was a part-owner of the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo, with son Fernando Jr. serving as team president and son Ricky serving as general manager. Fernando Jr. played in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations as a first baseman. 'To talk about Mexican baseball is to talk about Fernando Valenzuela. Thank you for putting Mexico's name high,' Baseball's National Teams Committee said on X. 'We join the Valenzuela Burgos family in their sorrow.' In addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife, Linda, who was a schoolteacher from Mexico whom he married in 1981, and daughters Linda and Maria as well as seven grandchildren.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fernando-valenzuela-mexican-born-pitcher-whose-feats-for-dodgers-fueled-fernandomania-dies-at-63-/7836121.html	2024-10-23T10:43:47-07:00	
Modi, Xi meeting signals thaw in frosty India-China ties	NEW DELHI — Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed the need to boost cooperation between the two countries on Wednesday during the first bilateral meeting held between the two leaders in five years. The meeting between Xi and Modi, held on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan, signaled a thaw in the icy hostility that has marked ties between the Asian giants since a bloody border clash between their armies in 2020. Televised images showed the two leaders shaking hands before they went into the meeting. It took place days after their governments announced an accord that is expected to ease military tensions along the disputed frontier where tens of thousands of soldiers have been massed on a war footing since the 2020 clash. 'The two sides should strengthen communication and cooperation, properly handle divergences and differences, and realize each other's development dreams,' Chinese state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying at the start of the meeting. He said that it was important for both sides to 'shoulder our international responsibilities.' 'It should be our priority to maintain peace and tranquility on the border,' Modi said. 'Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity should be the basis of our relationship.' A statement by the Indian Foreign Ministry said the two leaders affirmed that stable, predictable and amicable bilateral relations between India and China will have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters after the meeting that the endorsement of the recent agreement by the two leaders will lead to an easing of the situation along their frontier. 'Peace in the border areas will create space for returning toward normalization of ties,' Misri said. 'Now we must walk along that path.' The pact announced earlier this week involves allowing militaries from both sides to patrol contested sections of their Himalayan border. It aims at preventing border clashes and ensuring that the countries can 'quickly de-escalate' when there are disputes, according to Indian officials. China said on Tuesday that Beijing would work in the next stage to 'properly implement the plan with the Indian side.' In the last four years, both countries have withdrawn troops from some disputed areas after talks between their diplomats and military leaders, but there has been no breakthrough in reducing border tensions. On the other hand, both countries have raced to build roads and strengthen infrastructure in the high Himalayas, where the troops are backed by fighter jets and artillery tanks. It is not clear if there will be any withdrawal of troops from the border areas, but the accord is seen as a first step in ending the military standoff. The 2020 border clash killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. Smaller clashes took place in 2021 and 2022, raising fears of bigger clashes between troops in close proximity along disputed stretches of their 4,000-kilometer Himalayan border. Modi held brief meetings with Xi in Indonesia on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in 2022 and the BRICS summit in Johannesburg last year, but the two leaders had not held a bilateral meeting since 2019. Xi did not attend the Group of 20 meeting hosted by India last year. Political commentators in India called Wednesday’s meeting significant. 'It marks a major step in trying to normalize ties between the two countries,' said Manoj Joshi at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'Both countries are trying to lower the temperatures, but of course there is still a long distance to go.' India’s estrangement with China in recent years had prompted New Delhi to build closer defense and economic ties with the United States and Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7836079.html	2024-10-23T10:32:16-07:00	
Human Rights Watch criticizes Burkina Faso for omitting abuses in state report	Nairobi, Kenya — Human Rights Watch is calling out the government of Burkina Faso for failing to include human rights violations taking place in the country in a report to the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights. Burkinabe authorities, security forces and terror groups are all accused of widespread abuses against civilians and restrictions on people’s rights and freedoms. The commission requires member states to report on the human rights situation in their countries and the measures taken by the authorities to address the abuses. The last report covers 2015 to 2021 and was reviewed Wednesday. Allan Ngari, HRW’s Africa advocacy director, said Burkina Faso's reporting does not cover more recent abuses in the country. 'The report falls short of a number of human rights violations that we have been documenting as Human Rights Watch between 2021 to 2024, so this information is not readily available for the commission at this point,' Nagari said, adding that the group has shared reports with the commission to take recent years into consideration. Local and international human rights groups say widespread human rights violations are taking place in the country as the military government wrestles with insecurity caused by Islamist extremist groups. The rights groups say abuses by the government and military include arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture, and interference with the judiciary and media. The Islamist groups are also accused of serious abuses against civilians, including summary executions, sexual violence, abductions, and besieging towns and villages across the country. Burkina Faso's report to the commission says the government has established a panel to investigate and prosecute terrorism acts, observe detainees' rights and train its security forces in international human rights and humanitarian law to prevent abuse. Paul Ogendi teaches law at the University of Nairobi and is a human rights expert attached to the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. He said periodic reporting of the human rights situation in a given country can help the country improve its record and save lives. 'The reporting obligation is very important to help the country adhere to the African charter or comply with the obligation under the African charter,' Ogendi said. 'When you do not report, then it's very hard for the commission through its mandate to help you as a country improve on aspects where there might be weaknesses.' Ngari said people in Burkina Faso continue to face abuses but there are also other concerns. Those include safeguarding civic space for activists and journalists and political opposition who have been targeted by the state and 'disappeared' but were forced to join the front lines of battle against Islamic armed groups. 'People who have no training in military operations and yet are put on the front line,' Ngari said. 'So we are urging the commission to take into cognizance these anomalies and violations of the African Charter and to ask the government of Burkina Faso to pursue accountability for serious abuses.' Ogendi explained which actions the commission can take against a country that fails to comply. 'Most of the action is taken for the head of states to take note of what is happening and perhaps in some cases urge the state to be compliant with the obligations under the African Charter,' Ogendi said. 'But I have also seen a situation where the commission can have a mission in those countries or they can have advocacy visits to try to talk to the head of states of those who are responsible.' Last year, the commission wrote to Burkina Faso following the killing of civilians in Namentenga and Yatenga province to initiate an investigation and ensure the protection of civilians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-criticizes-burkina-faso-for-omitting-abuses-in-state-report-/7836096.html	2024-10-23T10:31:54-07:00	
Gabon to vote on constitution that would let military leader run for president	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Reactions were mixed in Gabon after military rulers this week announced that a referendum on a new constitution will be held November 16. The new charter would remove the post of prime minister, a move that critics say gives too much power to the president. The opposition is also unhappy that military leader General Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema would be allowed to run for president if the new constitution is approved. State media in Gabon is telling citizens that everyone 18 years and older has a civic duty to vote in the referendum. The country’s transitional military rulers said the new constitution would be a major step toward restoring civilian rule in Gabon and implementing recommendations of April's national dialogue — a nearly monthlong conference on how to achieve that objective. The proposed charter establishes August 30 as a Day of National Liberation to mark the bloodless coup in which Ngeuma seized power from President Ali Bongo last year. Military leaders say the coup saved Gabon from a serious political, economic and institutional crisis. The constitution would abolish the post of prime minister and create the post of vice president. Presidents would be directly elected by the people and limited to two seven-year terms. The new charter would also outlaw intimate relations between people of the same sex. Some Gabonese say the referendum is being rushed. Ondobo Emmanuel, a history student at Omar Bongo University in the capital, Libreville, said Gabon's transitional government officials should have taken at least two months to educate people on the basic principles and laws of the nation they are proposing before convening civilians to vote in a constitutional referendum. He said most people in Gabon neither read nor write and do not have access to television. Government officials said copies of the draft constitution have been distributed on social media platforms. However, an estimated 30% of the central African state’s civilians do not have internet access. Meanwhile, opposition parties say Nguema has not respected his promise to restore civilian rule by making it clear in the proposed constitution that the military should not play a role in politics. Jean Delors Biyogue, a member of the Constitutional Committee, defended the wording of the document. He said the proposed constitution would not bar qualified civilians and Gabon's defense staff members, including transitional president Nguema, from running for president because it would be undemocratic to restrain people who are capable from contributing to the welfare of Gabon. Biyogue also said the proposed constitution is revolutionary because it sets presidential term limits and makes it possible for power to alternate. If the constitution is approved, he said, Gabon will not find itself in a situation in which a leader rules until he dies, as was the case with Ali Bongo’s father, Omar Bongo, who was in power for 42 years. When Nguema seized power last year, he promised to restore civilian rule within two years. He has not said whether he will run for president at the end of the transitional period. But Thierry Essame, a member of Gabon's Civil Society Movement, said the proposed constitution makes it clear that Nguema wants to stay in power. Essame said Gabon's military leaders have not explained to civilians that officials are proposing a presidential system in which Nguema would have excessive powers. He said a presidential system should have separation and sharing of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government; the proposed constitution would mean that in Gabon, the president would appoint members of the judiciary and could dissolve parliament. Official campaigning for the constitutional referendum begins November 6.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-to-vote-on-constitution-that-would-let-military-leader-run-for-president/7835997.html	2024-10-23T09:49:08-07:00	
G7 allies move ahead with $50 billion loan for Ukraine backed by frozen Russian funds	Washington — Ukraine will receive $50 billion in loans, backed by frozen Russian assets, from Group of Seven allies, the White House said Wednesday. Distribution of the money will begin by year's end, according to American officials who said the United States is providing $20 billion of the total. Leaders of the wealthy democracies agreed earlier this year to engineer the mammoth loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival after Russia's invasion. Interest earned on profits from Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral. 'To be clear, nothing like this has ever been done before,' said Daleep Singh, the deputy national security adviser on international economics. 'Never before has a multilateral coalition frozen the assets of an aggressor country and then harnessed the value of those assets to fund the defense of the aggrieved party all while respecting the rule of law and maintaining solidarity.' At a ceremony Wednesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ukraine's finance minister, Sergii Marchenko, planned to put in writing assurances that the U.S. loan will be paid for by the windfall proceeds of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not by American taxpayer dollars. 'Russia is paying for this support,' Yellen said at a news conference Monday where she said the loan package was close to being finalized. Singh said the Biden administration intends to divide the U.S. share of $20 billion between aiding Ukraine’s economy and military. It will require congressional action to send military aid, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that weapons and equipment being promised now can take weeks or months to get to Ukraine. The additional $30 billion will come from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan, among others. The idea of using Russia’s frozen assets to help Ukraine faced resistance at first from European officials who cited legal and financial stability concerns. The move gained momentum after more than a year of negotiations between finance officials and after President Joe Biden in April signed legislation that let the government seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. The G7 announced in June that most of the loan would be backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in EU nations. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. The timing of the loan's disbursement has been called into question, coming about two weeks before the presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The candidates have taken opposing views on the threat from Russia. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin dismissed suggestions that military aid to Ukraine approved by the Biden administration now could be negated by any new team in power. 'I think we’re pretty sure that these materials will continue to flow,' Austin said, adding that he is confident it all will be delivered 'on the timeline that we’ve outlined.' The World Bank’s latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-allies-are-moving-ahead-with-50-billion-loan-for-ukraine-backed-by-frozen-russian-funds/7835996.html	2024-10-23T09:45:24-07:00	
Taiwan unveils plans to cope with potential Chinese military blockade	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan is stepping up efforts to strengthen its capabilities to respond to a potential military blockade by China, as Beijing increases military pressure on the democratically ruled island. In a report outlining Taiwan’s wartime food plan, which was submitted to parliament on Tuesday, the Ministry of Agriculture said it had maintained a three-month rice stockpile and ensured food and critical supplies were stored evenly across the island. According to the ministry, the current rice stockpile can sustain Taiwan for seven months, and its fish feed inventory is enough to support fishing in ponds for over three months if sea fishing is not possible. The government said it is also drafting plans to prepare for rice rationing during wartime. In the event of a Chinese military blockade, Taiwanese authorities said they would dedicate more farmland to grow rice and use additional ponds to grow aquaculture. The crops that Taiwan would prioritize growing in the event of war include sweet potatoes, soybeans and fresh vegetables. The ministry also plans to set up a task force to conduct a monthly inventory of the island’s food resources. Officials from Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs also laid out plans to boost Taiwan’s energy reserves and energy supply. Hu Wen-chong, director of the department of state-owned enterprise management at Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, told lawmakers Wednesday that the government plans to set up three natural gas receiving stations to enhance the natural gas safety stock to more than 14 days. Taiwan currently has enough stock to maintain natural gas supplies for eight days. In the event of a natural gas shortage during wartime, Hu told lawmakers that the government could activate some decommissioned coal-fired power plants to support the island’s energy supply needs. Maintaining Taiwan’s oil supply is another concern. Taiwan imports close to 70% of its oil from the Middle East, which some legislators worry could be affected if China pressures regional countries to halt exports to the island during a blockade. Hu said the island has diversified its oil procurement from other countries, such as the United States and Indonesia. Analysts welcomed the preparations for a potential blockade but said Taiwan’s wartime food and energy reserve plans were designed to cope with food natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes. 'Wartime is different from natural disasters because there won’t be threats posed by the Chinese military during an earthquake,' Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 'For these plans to work in wartime scenarios, there is still a lot of room for improvement.' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, noted that Taiwan has been taking monthly inventories of critical supplies and storing these resources across the island for a long time. 'There are close to 1,000 grain silos of various sizes across Taiwan, and it has been conducting critical resource distribution drills during the annual Wan An air-defense exercise in July,' Su said. Natural gas accounts for around half of Taiwan’s electricity, a crucial resource that Taiwan will not be able to import during a Chinese blockade. Su said figuring out ways to use the island's oil and coal stocks to supply electricity is important. In a phone interview with VOA, Su cited a report from Taiwan’s Energy Administration Act that said the island has about five months’ worth of oil and coal reserve, with around 190 million tons of underground coal. Those resources could be used to supply electricity if Taiwan experiences a natural gas shortage during a Chinese blockade, Su said. Chinese blockade 'an act of war' Over the past week, China has increased its military pressure on Taiwan, staging a one-day blockade-style military exercise around the island just days after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te‘s National Day speech on October 10. In the speech, Lai said the People’s Republic of China — China’s official name — has no right to represent Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory. China also began holding live-fire air and sea drills near Niushan island off the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defense minister Wellington Koo said a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait. The group was led by the Liaoning, China’s oldest aircraft carrier. Taiwan’s defense ministry said it was closely monitoring the Liaoning’s movement. Koo also said Beijing’s 'Joint Sword-2024B' exercise, which took place on October 13, fell short of the definition of an actual blockade since the Chinese military didn’t impose no-flight and no-sail zones. 'If you really want to carry out a so-called blockade, which according to international law is to prohibit all aircraft and ships entering the area, then according to United Nations resolutions it is regarded as a form of war,' he told journalists at Taiwan’s parliament on Wednesday. Koo added that since around one-fifth of global freight passes through the Taiwan Strait, a blockade imposed by China would have global consequences. 'The international community could not sit by and just watch,' Koo told lawmakers during a legislative session on Wednesday. Since August 2022, China has held at least four blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan and each exercise has served as a response to high-level political exchanges between Taiwan and the U.S. or important speeches delivered by Taiwan’s president. Lin at Tamkang University said while China is using these blockade-style military exercises to test its capabilities and improve coordination between different forces, they are also Beijing’s way of responding to major political remarks in Taiwan. 'China is trying to signal that whenever the Taiwanese government makes important political remarks, Beijing will respond militarily,' he told VOA. Lin said Taipei should closely monitor Chinese military exercises and adjust or improve the military’s defense and offense capabilities accordingly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-unveils-plans-to-cope-with-potential-chinese-military-blockade-/7835984.html	2024-10-23T09:45:13-07:00	
Voting for Harris another milestone in former President Jimmy Carter's legacy	Plains, Ga. — In a cavernous store filled with trinkets and knick-knacks, Philip Kurland is surrounded by politics. 'We’re the largest political memorabilia dealer in the United States,' he tells VOA as he sorts through numerous bins that line his shop. If there’s a button or badge supporting a political candidate, chances are Kurland has it, as he stops and inspects one button in particular. 'This is the number one button people request and come in for,' as he proudly shows an image of a smiling peanut shell. Every four years, Kurland stocks up on items featuring the candidates of the moment, and gauges support by the volume of related memorabilia he sells. 'Our sales have always equaled to who has won,' said Kurland. 'This year’s election is really hard to even say by my sales.' His store isn’t just any ordinary shop in the country. It’s the Plains Trading Post … as in Plains, Georgia, the hometown of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter with a population of around 600 people, where the streets are lined with dueling signs from the current election supporting both Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump. 'For the first time ever, I’d say there was some tension over the upcoming election,' Kurland told VOA. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Sumter County which encompasses Plains, and narrowly won the state of Georgia by 11,779 votes out of more than 5 million cast. 'It’s shocking that we’re a battleground state now,' said Kurland, acknowledging that polls continue to show a close race in Georgia this election cycle where both campaigns recognize every vote counts, including a prominent one cast by mail-in ballot from the most famous resident of Plains. 'I don’t think he’d miss any opportunity to vote,' said Kurland, 'I can remember one time when they passed a new law in the state that you had to show an ID, and he went to vote and didn’t have an ID, and they said, ‘you can’t vote.’ And he said, ‘I’m the president of the United States!’ and they said, ‘well, we’re sorry,’ and he had to go home and get an ID to vote, which I thought was hilarious.' 'He was excited to turn 100, but he’s more excited to cast his ballot for Vice President Harris,' Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, explained to VOA during a recent interview. Jason Carter currently serves as chairman of the board of the former president’s global nonprofit Carter Center. 'It would be an incredible story, at the end of his 100-year life, that is continuing on as we know, to have grown up in the segregated south and for one of his last political acts is to help elect a Black woman who is a president, I do think it would be important,' he said. 'Jimmy Carter has already said it was important for him to vote for Barack Obama in 2008,' said Joe Crespino, a professor of history at Emory University. Crespino believes Carter’s vote this year is directly connected to his legacy, specifically his efforts to get the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or ERA — which prohibits sex discrimination — ratified by some U.S. states while he was president in the 1970s. 'Voting for the first female candidate of color would be important for him not only because of his experiences with race over the course of his life but also his experiences in trying to advance women in public life,' he said. More than 40 years after Carter served in the White House, the ERA is still an unsettled issue as legal debates over its ratification continue. Jason Carter believes with a vote in the 2024 election, his grandfather is thinking as much about the future as he is the past. 'I think he wants to see this country brought back together,' said Carter. 'I think he wants to reduce that polarization; I think he wants us to focus on what makes us Americans first and fundamentally, and I think he thinks she [Harris] can do that.' Kurland said not everyone in Plains agrees with Jimmy Carter, or his candidate of choice, as he sees not just the tourists but some of the locals stopping in to pick up memorabilia. 'Some days you can’t get eight people to say the sun is shining at the same time,' he said. But Kurland admits everyone in Plains honors the man who continues to draw tens of thousands of tourists to their small town each year. 'Even though he’s come out for Kamala Harris, everyone that’s not for her would instantly forgive him and still love him,' Kurland said. As election day nears, Jimmy Carter continues to receive hospice care in his modest home in Plains on the edge of town, not far from the Depression-era boyhood farm where his story began 100 years ago.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-for-harris-another-milestone-in-former-president-jimmy-carter-s-legacy/7835958.html	2024-10-23T09:15:33-07:00	
Guatemalan publisher vows to keep defending his case from house arrest	Washington — Two days after his transfer from prison to house arrest, publisher Jose Ruben Zamora had a visitor: Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo. At the meeting Monday afternoon, Arevalo and Zamora had 'an open and frank dialogue with a focus on key issues for the future of the country,' according to the Guatemalan presidency. Zamora, 67, had been detained on questionable grounds for two years. In 2023, he was sentenced to six years in prison for money laundering. But an appeals court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial for 2025. A court on Friday finally ordered Zamora to be released for 'human rights reasons' and because the 'prison term has exceeded the limits.' After his release the following day, the journalist said he was 'extraordinarily happy for all the support' he had received from fellow journalists and international media watchdogs. Zamora was arrested in July 2022 after publishing an editorial in his former media outlet El Periodico. International groups said the accusation of money laundering and other charges leveled at him were in response to his media coverage and reporting on corruption in the government of former president Alejandro Giammattei. Following the court order, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the international lawyer who represents the publisher, said in a statement that 'Zamora will finally be released but is not yet free.' 'His release is conditional, and he continues to face spurious charges with the risk of a return to prison hanging over him. The Guatemalan authorities must now drop the charges and bring an end to this cruel persecution,' said Gallagher, of Doughty Street Chambers in London. The judge prohibited Zamora from leaving the country and ordered him to report to the prosecutor’s office every week. He may no longer be in prison, but he still faces legal challenges. Zamora said he will defend himself while under house arrest and deal with other issues. 'I do have to respond to obligations. I owe banks, I have no income, but I have to move forward,' Zamora told a group of journalists moments after his release. His case brought worldwide attention to the state of press freedom in Guatemala. The country ranks 138 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment. Press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, reports that even though freedom of the press is guaranteed in Guatemala’s constitution, politicians and other government officials violate that right continuously. Zamora founded El Periodico, an independent media outlet that exposed multiple corruption scandals in Guatemala, in 1996. After his arrest, it closed. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols welcomed Zamora’s release, reaffirming Washington's commitment to defending press freedom in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-arevalo-visits-guatemalan-publisher-under-house-arrest/7835944.html	2024-10-23T08:59:19-07:00	
Chinese official urges Apple to continue 'deepening' presence in China	A top Chinese official has urged tech giant Apple to deepen its presence and investment in innovation in the world’s second largest economy at a time when supply chains and companies are shifting production and operations away from China. As U.S.-China geopolitical tensions simmer and tech competition between Beijing and Western countries intensifies, foreign investment in China shrunk in 2023 to its lowest level in three decades, according to government statistics. The United States has banned the export of advanced technology to China and Beijing’s crackdown on spying in the name of national security concerns has spooked investors. On Wednesday, Jin Zhuanglong - China's Minister for Industry and Information Technology – told Apple CEO Tim Cook he hoped that, 'Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market,' urging Cook to 'increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment,' according to a ministry statement. At the meeting Jin also discussed 'Apple's development in China, network data security management, (and) cloud services,' according to the statement. China has the world’s largest market for smartphones, and Apple is a leading competitor. However, increasingly the iPhone producer has lost market share in the country due to an increasing number of local rivals in the smartphone sector. In the second quarter of this year, AFP reports that Apple ranked sixth among smartphone vendors in China, holding a 16% market share, marking a drop of three positions compared to its ranking during the same period last year, according to analysis firm Canalys. Jin also repeated a frequent pledge from officials in Beijing that China would strive to provide a 'better environment' for global investors and 'continue to expand high-level opening up. Cook’s trip to China was his second of the year. His posts on the X-like Chinese social media platform Weibo showed he visited an Apple store in downtown Beijing, visited an organic farm, and toured ancient neighborhoods with prominent artists such as local photographer Chen Man. Cook added that he met with students from China’s Agricultural University and Zhejiang University to receive feedback on how iPhones and iPads can help farmers adopt more sustainable practices. Some information in this report came from Reuters and AFP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-official-urges-apple-to-continue-deepening-presence-in-china/7835927.html	2024-10-23T08:59:01-07:00	
Pakistani court grants bail, orders release of ex-leader's wife	ISLAMABAD — A federal high court in Pakistan on Wednesday approved the bail application of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's wife, ordering her release after months of imprisonment related to corruption allegations. The lawsuit against former first lady Bushra Bibi involves the alleged sale of state gifts worth half a million dollars during Khan’s time in office from 2018 to 2022, charges Bibi and Khan rejected as unfounded and politically motivated. It remained uncertain whether Bibi would be allowed to leave prison anytime soon, given the many other legal challenges the couple has faced since a parliamentary no-confidence vote ousted Khan's government 18 months ago. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, Party of the deposed prime minister praised Wednesday's court ruling but accused the authorities of employing delaying tactics to continue Bibi's 'unlawful incarceration.' The statement reiterated that Bibi is a housewife and that the case against her arose from a nontransparent investigation, labeling the charges as baseless. Khan, who has been imprisoned since August 2023, and his wife are in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, a garrison city next to Islamabad. Bibi has been detained since January after being sentenced, along with Khan, to 14 years in a separate graft case, although an appeals court suspended the sentence weeks later for a lack of evidence. Subsequently, appeals courts overturned or suspended other convictions and sentences, but Pakistani authorities refused to release the couple, instead announcing new charges against them in July related to the alleged sale of state gifts. Khan, 72, faces numerous charges, including corruption and violence against state institutions, all of which the former prime minister says are orchestrated at the behest of the powerful Pakistani military to keep him from returning to national politics, charges his successors and military officials denied. The legal challenges have prevented the former cricket star-turned-politician from pursuing public office. His party was banned from participating in the national election in February. Khan maintains that the election was rigged to allow pro-military parties to secure victory. In June, a panel of independent United Nations experts urged Pakistan to end Khan's incarceration, saying his detention had 'no legal basis.' New chief justice Meanwhile, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday approved the selection of the country’s next chief justice, who was recommended under newly enacted constitutional amendments that critics decried as detrimental to judicial independence. Justice Yahya Afridi, the third-most senior judge after the outgoing chief justice, was picked by a government-dominated parliamentary committee on Tuesday, a day after a ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hastily amended the constitution. Previously, the judge who was second in seniority would automatically take over as the country’s chief justice when the top judge retired at 65. Law Minister Azam Tarar said that Afridi will replace the outgoing Supreme Court chief justice, who retires on Friday, for a three-year term in line with the new constitutional amendments. Khan’s PTI denounced the legislation as an assault on Pakistan’s judicial independence, saying judges handpicked by the Sharif government would decide everything. U.N. human rights chief Volker Turk said he was concerned about the constitutional amendments. In a brief statement that his office posted on X, he noted that the changes 'were adopted hastily, without broad consultation and debate.' Turk warned that these changes 'will seriously undermine the independence of the judiciary' and emphasized the importance of aligning constitutional reforms with international human rights law. The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, or ICJ, described the new legislation as 'a blow to judicial independence, the rule of law and human rights protection' in Pakistan. 'These changes bring an extraordinary level of political influence over the process of judicial appointments and the judiciary’s own administration,' said Santiago Canton, ICJ’s secretary general. 'They erode the judiciary’s capacity to independently and effectively function as a check against excesses by other branches of the state and protect human rights,' Canton said. Sharif and his Cabinet ministers have defended the constitutional changes, claiming they would prevent alleged judicial interference in governance matters that led to the dismissal of successive governments in Pakistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-court-grants-bail-orders-release-of-ex-leader-s-wife/7835891.html	2024-10-23T08:32:43-07:00	
Attack at Turkey aviation site leaves some dead, injured	Ankara — A deadly attack was carried out at the Turkish Aerospace Industries' headquarters near Ankara on Wednesday, the government said, as broadcasters showed footage of several armed assailants entering the building amid reports of gunfire and a loud explosion. 'A terrorist attack was carried out against the TUSAS facilities in Kahramankazan, Ankara. Unfortunately, we have martyrs and injured people,' Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media X, referring to the Aerospace Industries. The cause and perpetrators of the blast and subsequent gunfire remained unclear. Some media reports claimed a suicide attack had occurred and that there were hostages inside the building. Officials have not confirmed this. Witnesses told Reuters that employees inside the building were taken by authorities to shelters and no one was permitted to leave. They said bombings may have taken place at different exits as employees were leaving work for the day. The state-owned Anadolu Agency said emergency services were dispatched to the site, while television images showed a damaged gate and an exchange of gunfire in a parking lot. The images showed the attackers carrying assault rifles and backpacks as they entered the building. Anadolu also said prosecutors had launched an investigation into the attack. TUSAS is one of Turkey's most important defense and aviation companies. It produces KAAN, the country's first national combat aircraft, among other projects, and has over 10,000 employees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/attack-at-turkey-aviation-site-leaves-some-dead-injured/7835845.html	2024-10-23T07:54:19-07:00	
Armed group says it takes control of Myanmar rare earth mining hub	An armed group fighting Myanmar's ruling military said it has taken control of a mining hub that is a major supplier of rare earth oxides to China, likely disrupting shipments of elements used in clean energy and other technologies. Rare earth mining in Myanmar is concentrated in Kachin state around the towns of Panwa and Chipwe, adjacent to southwestern China's Yunnan province. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) took control of Panwa on Oct. 19, spokesperson Colonel Naw Bu told Reuters on Tuesday. It had previously captured Chipwe, according to local Myanmar media. Reuters was not able to independently verify the status of both towns. The KIA is focused on managing the town of Panwa and has no current plans for rare earths or other economic issues, Naw Bu said. He did not respond when asked whether the KIA is open to working with China on rare earths. Previously, rare earth mining areas in Kachin state were under the control of militia group NDA-K, which is allied with Myanmar's junta government and welcomed payments from Chinese companies looking to establish mines. Last year, Myanmar supplied China with about 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides (REOs) from ion-adsorption clays (IACs), eclipsing China's domestic IAC mining quota of 19,000 tons and making it the world's top exporter of heavy REOs, according to broker Ord Minnett. 'Rebel control of these mining sites could potentially disrupt rare earth concentrate shipments into China, which have declined for four months straight owing to the monsoon season and other challenges,' research firm Adamas Intelligence said in a note on Monday. China is the world's biggest consumer and importer of rare earth ores and compounds, which it uses to produce refined rare earth and magnets, industries it dominates. Last month, China halted rare earth imports from Myanmar and suspended exports of ammonium sulphate used to leach rare earths there due to the conflict, said Ord Minnett analyst Matthew Hope. 'I expect the KIA plans to resume the REO business provided China is prepared to accept the exports and supply the technicians and ammonium sulphate. But I reckon it will expect payments before letting the companies do so,' Hope said. 'Once the conflict passes, we expect financial deals with Chinese miners will be renegotiated, likely delaying restarts until early-2025,' he said, adding that prices for REOs used in magnets are likely to rise as supply tightens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-group-says-it-takes-control-of-myanmar-rare-earth-mining-hub/7835802.html	2024-10-23T07:09:56-07:00	
Greek PM deplores worst climate conditions in 4 decades	Athens — Wildfire-plagued Greece has suffered its worst year in terms of climate conditions in four decades in 2024, its prime minister told parliament on Wednesday. The already sun-baked Mediterranean region has been designated by scientists as a climate change 'hotspot', with warming higher than the global average, according to United Nations reports. Greece has been perennially struck by scorching heatwaves and destructive wildfires every summer, with conditions worsening in recent years. 'We were expecting a very difficult year in terms of climate, it was objectively the most difficult in the past 40 years according to data by all scientists, including those from the national climate monitor,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament. He pointed to 'temperatures constantly higher than average', 'prolonged drought', 'strong winds', adding that Greece needed to face the consequences of climate change. The number of wildfires so far this year has reached 9,101, up from 7,163 last year, with 44,000 hectares (109,000 acres) burnt, the premier said during a parliamentary debate on the matter. Forest blazes began earlier than normal this year, with one igniting at the end of March in the country's north. Greece experienced its hottest summer ever, Athens's climate monitor said in September, with premature heatwaves in June, and record-high summer temperatures. June and July were the warmest months since records began in 1960, while August was the second hottest after August 2021, the observatory said on its meteo.gr website. More than 20 people died in Greek forest fires last year, with a massive blaze in Dadia national park dubbed the most destructive ever recorded in the European Union. Rising temperatures are leading to extended wildfire seasons and increasing the area burnt by the blazes, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-pm-deplores-worst-climate-conditions-in-4-decades/7835758.html	2024-10-23T06:38:42-07:00

Boeing reports $6 billion quarterly loss ahead of vote by union workers who have crippled production	EVERETT, Wash. — Boeing reported a loss of more than $6 billion in the third quarter and immediately turned its attention to union workers who will vote Wednesday whether to accept a company contract offer or continue their crippling strike, which has dragged on for nearly six weeks. New CEO Kelly Ortberg laid out his plan to turn Boeing around after years of heavy losses and damage to its reputation. In remarks he planned to deliver later Wednesday to investors, Ortberg said Boeing needs 'a fundamental culture change in the company.' To accomplish that, he said, company leaders need to spend more time on factory floors to know what is going on and 'prevent the festering of issues and work better together to identify, fix, and understand root cause.' Ortberg repeated that he wants to 'reset' management’s relationship with labor 'so we don’t become so disconnected in the future.' He expressed hope that machinists will vote to approve the company’s latest contract offer and end their strike. 'It will take time to return Boeing to its former legacy, but with the right focus and culture, we can be an iconic company and aerospace leader once again,' he said. The strike is an early test for Ortberg, a Boeing outsider who became CEO in August. Ortberg has already announced large-scale layoffs and a plan to raise enough cash to avoid a bankruptcy filing. He needs to convince federal regulators that Boeing is fixing its safety culture and is ready to boost production of the 737 Max — a crucial step to bring in much-needed cash. Boeing can't produce any new 737s, however, until it ends the strike by 33,000 machinists that has shut down assembly plants in the Seattle area. Ortberg has 'got a lot on his plate, but he probably is laser-focused on getting this negotiation completed. That’s the closest alligator to the boat,' said Tony Bancroft, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, a Boeing investor. Boeing hasn't had a profitable year since 2018, and the situation is about to get worse before it gets better. Boeing said Wednesday that it lost $6.17 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, with an adjusted loss of $10.44 per share. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research were calling for a loss of $10.34 per share. Revenue totaled $17.84 billion, matching Wall Street estimates. Shares were flat before the opening bell. Investors will be looking for Ortberg to project calm, determination and urgency as he presides over an earnings call for the first time since he ran Rockwell Collins, a maker of avionics and flight controls for airline and military planes, in the last decade. The biggest news of the day, however, is likely to come Wednesday evening, when the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers reveals whether striking workers are ready to go back to their jobs. They will vote at union halls in the Seattle area and elsewhere on a Boeing offer that includes pay raises of 35% over four years, $7,000 ratification bonuses, and the retention of performance bonuses that Boeing wanted to eliminate. Boeing has held firm in resisting a union demand to restore the traditional pension plan that was frozen a decade ago. However, older workers would get a slight increase in their monthly pension payouts. At a picket line outside Boeing’s factory in Everett, Washington, some machinists encouraged colleagues to vote no. 'The pension should have been the top priority. We all said that was our top priority, along with wage,' said Larry Best, a customer-quality coordinator with 38 years at Boeing. 'Now is the prime opportunity in a prime time to get our pension back, and we all need to stay out and dig our heels in.' Best also thinks the pay increase should be 40% over three years to offset a long stretch of stagnant wages, now combined with high inflation. 'You can see we got a great turnout today. I’m pretty sure that they don’t like the contract because that’s why I’m here,' said another picketer, Bartley Stokes Sr., who started working at Boeing in 1978. 'We’re out here in force, and we’re going to show our solidarity and stick with our union brothers and sisters and vote this thing down because they can do better.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-reports-6-billion-quarterly-loss-ahead-of-vote-by-union-workers-who-have-crippled-production-/7835692.html	2024-10-23T05:41:13-07:00	
Britain Prime Minister Starmer plays down Trump team claims of interference	London — Britain’s prime minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday played down allegations made by Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump's team of 'blatant foreign interference' by his Labour Party in the U.S. election, saying it was normal for its volunteers to campaign. Starmer also insisted that he maintained 'a good relationship' with Trump, having met him for talks last month. The former president's legal team filed a complaint to the U.S. Federal Election Commission alleging the 'British Labour Party made, and the [Kamala] Harris campaign accepted, illegal foreign national contributions.' The filing cited media reports that Labour officials, including the prime minister's new chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, traveled to the United States to advise the Harris campaign. Trump's team also submitted a now-deleted LinkedIn post by Labour director of operations Sofia Patel calling for volunteers to travel to North Carolina, saying 'we will sort out your housing.' Foreign nationals are allowed to volunteer in U.S. elections but may not be compensated. Starmer told media traveling with him to a Commonwealth meeting on the Pacific island of Samoa that his party had done nothing wrong, and that the volunteers had paid for themselves. 'The Labour party has volunteers, who have gone over pretty much every election,' he said. 'They're doing it in their spare time, they're doing it as volunteers, they're staying, I think, with other volunteers over there.' 'That's what they've done in previous elections, that's what they're doing in this election and that's really straightforward.' He also denied suggestions that it could damage relations with Britain's most important ally should Republican party candidate Trump beat Democrat Harris and secure a return to the White House. Starmer said he had 'established a good relationship' with the former president, having met him last month for a two-hour dinner at the former real estate tycoon's Trump Tower residence in New York. Adding to the dispute, Trump surrogate Elon Musk wrote on his X site on Tuesday that 'this is war' after leaked documents from campaign group Center for Countering Digital Hate appeared to show that one of its objectives was to 'kill Musk's Twitter,' X's former name. The campaign group and think-tank is led by a former Labour adviser and McSweeney is a former director.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-prime-minister-starmer-plays-down-trump-team-claims-of-interference-/7835597.html	2024-10-23T04:06:49-07:00	
Japan election could weaken LDP, undermine Ishiba government	A whirlwind month of Japanese politics culminates Sunday with a general election. If polls are accurate, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could lose seats – a blow to a party that has ruled Japan for all but four of the past 65 years. It could also blunt the ambitions of Japan’s new prime minister, as VOA’s Bill Gallo reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-election-could-weaken-ldp-undermine-ishiba-government/7835558.html	2024-10-23T03:20:55-07:00

Namibia opposition demonstrates against ballots contract	Windhoek, Namibia — As Namibia prepares to hold a general election next month, the country's main opposition party has objected to the South African company hired to print the ballots. The company, Ren-Form, is under investigation by Zimbabwe’s anti-corruption commission for alleged fraudulent conduct during that country’s elections. Over 110 members of Namibia’s People’s Democratic Movement marched to the Electoral Commission of Namibia’s offices in the capital on Tuesday. They delivered a petition asking it to cancel a contract with Ren-Form, which is to design, print and deliver ballot papers to be used in Namibia’s elections. Party leader McHenry Venaani said Ren-Form is tainted by the 2023 allegations in Zimbabwe. 'The accusation of the money that is involved is going into millions of Namibian dollars, over 800 million Namibian dollars to be exact, [for a company] currently under investigation by the Zimbabwean anti-corruption commission for money-laundering and abuse of office,' Venaani said. VOA contacted Ren-Form for comment but has not received a response. Political analyst Rakkel Andreas, who was stationed as an observer in last year’s elections in Zimbabwe, said the party's reservations and protests against the contract with Ren-Form are valid. She told VOA the company contributed to what she called 'systemic disruption' during the Zimbabwe elections. 'There were some polling stations where ballot papers were not delivered on time. People needed to come back the next day. Of course, one could argue that the electoral body of Zimbabwe was tasked with the distribution, it’s true,' she said. 'But there were certain things, certain materials that only became available to them later on, after the elections, so in that regard the position of the PDM is definitely valid.' Andreas said the PDM is right to speak up now so that it can object to any irregularities seen on or after election day. The Electoral Commission of Namibia accepted the petition by the main opposition and said they will forward it to the relevant institutions. The commission's spokesperson, De Wet Malauli, said in an earlier interview with VOA that the commission stands by the awarding of the contract to Ren-Form and said the accusations against the company are baseless. He said the allegations are meant to undermine public confidence in the electoral body that oversees Namibia’s elections. 'The decision to award the contract to Ren-Form was made following a thorough, rigorous evaluation process that adhered to the laws governing procurement,' he said. 'Factors considered included compliance with the technical requirements, cost-effectiveness, reliability and the ability to meet strict timelines.' He said the company being questioned has a track record of more than 70 elections over 20 years on the African continent, and the body will not rescind its decision. The PDM said it is consulting its lawyers with the goal of having the company removed from the election process. Fifteen presidential candidates and 21 political parties will contest the elections in Namibia, slated for the November 27. The general election is Namibia's seventh since attaining independence from South Africa in 1990.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-opposition-demonstrates-against-ballots-contract/7835527.html	2024-10-23T02:16:23-07:00	
Malaysia charges 22 people linked to Islamic firm GISB with organized crime	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia charged 22 people linked to an Islamic conglomerate, including its chief executive, on Wednesday for organized crime, according to court documents and the company's lawyer. Authorities last month launched a wide-ranging probe into Global Ikhwan Services and Business (GISB) Holdings, for various crimes including suspected money laundering, human trafficking and sexual offenses against children, after police rescued hundreds of youngsters from suspected abuse at care homes run by the firm. GISB, which police say is linked to a banned religious sect, has denied allegations of widespread abuse and other misconduct although its chief executive Nasiruddin Mohd Ali acknowledged that 'one or two' cases of sodomy had occurred at its shelters. On Wednesday, Nasiruddin and other members of GISB were charged with organized crime, an offense that carries jail terms between five and 20 years if convicted, charge sheets reviewed by Reuters showed. The documents did not provide details on the alleged charge. 'There will be a representation, an appeal, and a challenge of the charges,' GISB lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin told reporters after a court hearing where the chargesheets were issued. Those charged on Wednesday included Mohammad Adib At-Tarmimi, the son of late Malaysian preacher Ashaari Mohamed, the founder of the Al-Arqam religious sect that was outlawed by the government in 1994 for allegedly spreading deviant Islamic teachings in the Muslim-majority country. GISB has acknowledged its links to Al-Arqam, but now describes itself as an Islamic conglomerate based on Muslim practices. However, Malaysia's home affairs minister said last week investigations found many GISB followers still adhered to Al-Arqam teachings, while religious authorities in several states have issued fatwas declaring the group deviant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-charges-22-people-linked-to-islamic-firm-gisb-with-organized-crime/7835504.html	2024-10-23T01:20:43-07:00	
Incoming EU foreign policy chief Kallas warns against Russia and China	The European Union's next foreign policy chief has told lawmakers that strengthening security must be a priority, warning that Europe must be prepared as Russia and 'partly China' exploit the continent’s open societies. 'European security is deeply personal to me as a native of a country that has long told others that Russia's imperialistic dream never died,' Kaja Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, said in written replies to members of the European Parliament published late on Tuesday. 'My short-term priority must be to address the pressing global concerns: Russia’s war against Ukraine and strengthening the EU’s security and defense,' she wrote. Kallas, nominated by European leaders in June to serve as the bloc's new high representative for foreign affairs, is set to succeed incumbent Josep Borrell. The European Parliament will hold hearings in November for members of the next European Commission. In 21 pages of answers to questions posed by the lawmakers ahead of the hearings, the Estonian politician outlined her vision for Europe's foreign policy at a time when the bloc faces an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. The EU must stay at 'the forefront of humanitarian efforts' in the Middle East,' Kallas said, and work 'with all actors to support the pursuit of a just and comprehensive peace' while also pointing to challenges such as China's support for Russia. 'Actors such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and partly China, aim at weaponizing interdependencies and exploiting the openness of our societies against us,' she added. 'For this, we must be prepared.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/incoming-eu-foreign-policy-chief-kallas-warns-against-russia-and-china/7835495.html	2024-10-23T00:59:40-07:00	
Blinken says there is ‘real opportunity’ for deal to free hostages after killing of Hamas leader	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar presents a 'real opportunity' to achieve an agreement to free the remaining hostages still being held by the militant group in the Gaza Strip. Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv before flying to Saudi Arabia, Blinken said Israel has achieved a number of successes in the war against Hamas, including degrading the group’s military capabilities. The top U.S. diplomat said what remains is bringing the hostages home and bringing the war to an end. Blinken said ending the war must be done in a way that keeps Hamas out of Gaza and ensures Israeli troops do not stay there. Plans for a post-war Gaza, including issues such as governance, security, reconstruction and what the international community can do to aid Palestinians, will be the topic of Blinken’s discussions with Arab partners in the coming days, he said. A week after Blinken sent a letter warning Israel to increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. military aid, he said Wednesday there has been progress, but that there needs to be more and it needs to be sustained. Blinken told reporters he issued a similar warning earlier this year, which was followed by Israel quickly facilitating an increase in aid that did not last. The threats are linked to legal obligations that U.S. humanitarian aid should not be hindered by a recipient of U.S. military aid. Pressed on whether the new warning is an empty threat, Blinken said Wednesday: 'I am determined to follow the law. I will follow the law.' Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials Tuesday on his 11th visit to the region since the Israel-Hamas war erupted more than a year ago. Netanyahu and Blinken also discussed Israel’s ongoing fighting with Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon. The Israeli leader told Blinken was a need for a security and political change in Lebanon that would allow displaced Israelis to return safely to their homes in northern Israel. The Blinken-Netanyahu meeting came six days after the killing of Sinwar and a little more than a week after the United States threatened to withhold some U.S. military aid without progress in delivering more assistance to Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says a humanitarian crisis continues unabated. With the U.S. presidential election two weeks away, President Joe Biden asked Blinken to return to push for progress in reaching a cease-fire in the Gaza fighting, seeing new hope after Israel's killing of Sinwar, the architect of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. U.S. officials have said that Sinwar was intransigent in negotiations for a cease-fire, but no new talks have been started since his killing. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,600 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with Israel saying that the death toll includes several thousand Hamas militants. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Blinken on previous trips to the Mideast has sought to prevent the conflict from escalating into a regional war. But Israel since last month has been striking across Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran. Miller said Blinken again called for a 'diplomatic resolution' in Lebanon and compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 of 2006 that calls for the long-term disarmament of Hezbollah but also a withdrawal of Israeli forces from its northern neighbor. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-says-there-is-real-opportunity-for-deal-to-free-hostages-after-killing-of-hamas-leader/7835489.html	2024-10-23T00:48:26-07:00	
Twelfth monkey death at Hong Kong zoo, soil infection blamed	HONG KONG — A 12th monkey has died at a Hong Kong zoo, authorities said late on Tuesday, after 11 monkeys died in the past week due to melioidosis, a bacterial infection, which can affect both humans and animals. Housed in five separate cages, the deceased monkeys included the De Brazza species as well as one common squirrel monkey, cotton-top tamarins and white-faced sakis. The zoo, located just above the city's financial center, has shut its mammals section since October 14, when authorities reported the first batch of monkey deaths. The government said it would continue to close the section and provide protective gear and health monitoring for staff taking care of the animals. 'The health conditions of the 78 mammals are normal,' the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said. Authorities said 11 monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis. Tests were being done on the 12th deceased monkey to find out the cause of death. Autopsies in the past week found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys organs, which likely came from soil near the monkeys habitat, authorities said. The zoo, built in 1860, is the oldest park in Hong Kong.	https://www.voanews.com/a/twelfth-monkey-death-at-hong-kong-zoo-soil-infection-blamed/7835485.html	2024-10-23T00:14:28-07:00	
Shootout in Mexico's Sinaloa state kills 19, local cartel leader arrested	MEXICO CITY — A shootout near the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state killed 19 suspected gang members, while one local cartel leader was arrested, Mexico's defense ministry said on Tuesday, as intra-cartel violence intensifies. The deadly altercation on Monday took place about 11 kilometers outside the Sinaloa capital of Culiacan, when a group of more than 30 gunmen fired on soldiers, according to a statement from the ministry. It added that some of the suspected cartel gunmen fled the scene after federal agents returned fire. The detainee was identified as Edwin Antonio 'N' - his last name withheld as is typical for those accused of crimes in Mexico - and described as a local leader of the Sinaloa Cartel faction led by its legendary co-founder Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada. A document dated October 22 from Mexico's national registry of detained persons obtained by Reuters listed an Edwin Antonio Rubio Lopez apprehended by military personnel in Sinaloa. Seven vehicles and nearly 30 firearms, including machine guns, ammunition and military-style vests and helmets were also seized. Violence has flared in the western Pacific coast state ever since the late July arrest of Zambada, after he was flown to an airstrip in the United States near the city of El Paso, Texas, and promptly taken into custody by U.S. officials. The veteran cartel leader is believed to be in his 70s. He has alleged that a senior member of the Los Chapitos, another faction of the Sinaloa cartel, kidnapped him and then flew him to the United States against his will. The gangland violence plaguing Sinaloa is seen by security analysts as likely pitting the two factions against each other, and has intensified since early September with around 200 dead and more than 300 others believed to be missing, according to official data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shootout-in-mexico-s-sinaloa-state-kills-19-local-cartel-leader-arrested/7835481.html	2024-10-22T23:54:34-07:00	
Taipei says Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through Taiwan Strait	Taipei, Taiwan — A Chinese aircraft carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday, Taiwan's defense minister said, a day after Beijing held a live-fire exercise near the self-ruled island. China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has ramped up military activity around the island in recent years to pressure Taipei into accepting its claims of sovereignty. 'The Liaoning is passing through the Taiwan Strait now, sailing north along the west of the median line (of the passage) and we are closely monitoring it,' Defense Minister Wellington Koo told reporters. The Liaoning, China's oldest aircraft carrier, took part in Beijing's large-scale military drills around Taiwan last week that were condemned by Taipei and its key backer Washington. A blockade was among the exercises carried out. Koo warned on Wednesday that an actual blockade of Taiwan would be an 'act of war' and have a 'very serious impact on the global economy.' China has two aircraft carriers in active service, and a third undergoing sea trials. The Liaoning has previously passed through the strait. It appeared to be returning to Qingdao port in eastern China via the Pratas Islands, in the northern part of the South China Sea, for 'replenishing and necessary maintenance,' said Jiang Hsin-biao, a military expert at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research. Its involvement in the recent military drills was for 'the purpose of practicing against foreign forces and intimidating Taiwan,' Jiang told AFP. Stronger language Beijing sent a record number of military aircraft, including fighter jets and drones, as well as warships to encircle Taiwan on October 14 in what Beijing said was a 'stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces.' It was in response to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's National Day speech on October 10 in which he vowed to 'resist annexation,' and insisted that Beijing and Taipei were not subordinate to each other. Lai, who took office in May, has used stronger language than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, angering China's leaders in Beijing who call him a 'separatist.' Taipei said Tuesday the live-fire drill could be part of Beijing's 'tactics to bolster its intimidation in conjunction with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait'. Over the weekend, a U.S. and a Canadian warship passed through the 180-kilometer Taiwan Strait, part of regular passages by Washington and its allies meant to reinforce its status as an international waterway. Beijing condemned the passage as disrupting 'peace and stability' in the strait. Taiwan's defense ministry said Wednesday it had detected 15 Chinese military aircraft and six navy vessels in the skies and waters around the island in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. Wednesday. China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since 1949 after Chiang Kai-shek's nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Mao Zedong's communist fighters. While Taiwan has its own government, military, and currency, Beijing insists the island is part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring it under its control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-says-chinese-aircraft-carrier-group-sailed-through-taiwan-strait/7835479.html	2024-10-22T23:44:18-07:00	
North Korea's Kim Jong Un visits missile bases, cites US nuclear threat	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has visited missile bases to examine their readiness to undertake actions of 'strategic deterrence,' while calling U.S. nuclear capabilities a growing threat to the country, state media reported on Wednesday. The U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal poses an 'ever-increasing threat' to North Korea's security environment, which demands that Pyongyang maintain a strict counteraction posture of its nuclear forces, he was quoted as saying by KCNA. North Korea has been stepping up its development of ballistic missiles and a nuclear arsenal, drawing international sanctions, and forming close military relations with Russia. Kim's visit to the bases comes amid growing tensions with South Korea and its allies. This has included concerns over what Seoul says is a dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia to fight in Ukraine, a claim that has been denied by Pyongyang. South Korea's National Security Adviser Shin Won-sik and Jacek Siewiera, the head of the Polish National Security Bureau, expressed concern over Pyongyang's military cooperation with Moscow during a meeting in Seoul. The two also agreed to cooperate closely with the international community on the issue, according to a statement released by South Korea's presidential office. In the KCNA report, Kim also called for the modernisation of the armed forces by giving priority to strategic missiles in the future, calling it 'an important principle of the strategy for building national defense.' He was accompanied on his visit by Kim Yo Jong, his powerful sister, and Kim Jong Sik, the first vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, KCNA reported. Photographs released by KCNA showed Kim dressed in a leather coat inspecting the missile bases. KCNA did not specify when the visits took place.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-visits-missile-bases-cites-us-nuclear-threat/7835476.html	2024-10-22T23:29:42-07:00	
LeBron, Bronny James make NBA history with father-son appearance	Los Angeles — LeBron and Bronny James made NBA history on Tuesday, becoming the first father-and-son duo to play alongside each other in a regular season fixture as the Los Angeles Lakers opened their campaign against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The duo, who played together briefly in a pre-season game earlier this month, took to the court together late in the second quarter at the Crypto.com Arena with the Lakers leading 51-35. An enormous roar went up from the home crowd as the James duo were brought onto the court by coach J.J. Redick after the Lakers had surged into a double-digit lead. In a perfectly scripted moment that was pure Hollywood, the James' double-act was watched at courtside by Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr, who made baseball history playing for the Seattle Mariners as father and son in 1990-1991. 'We made history; now we get to watch history,' said Griffey Jr., who joined his father to pose for photos with LeBron and Bronny James shortly before Tuesday's tip-off. Lakers officials had been coy before Tuesday's season-opener about where and when LeBron James and Bronny would play their first regular season fixture together. However, NBA superstar LeBron James, who turns 40 in December, admitted in pre-game remarks that he could scarcely contain his excitement at the prospect of realizing his long-cherished dream of sharing a court with his son. 'Just to run out the tunnel knowing that he'll be in uniform, run out the tunnel with him, see him warm up, and be out there with the rest of my teammates,' James told reporters during a morning shoot-around on Tuesday. 'This is my 22nd time running out on opening night so I don't know how many times I'll have an opportunity, how many times I've got left to run out. I won't take it for granted.' Anticipation about the James double-act has dominated the Lakers' preparations for the new season since Bronny James was selected by the franchise with the 55th pick in the draft in June. 'It's been a treat' Bronny James, 20, is expected to spend most of his rookie season in the developmental G-League rather than the Lakers senior squad. LeBron James however said Tuesday that he had relished being able to accompany his son on his first steps into professional basketball. 'It's been a treat and just in preseason, the practices, just every day,' James said. 'The plane rides, the bus rides of being with him and showing him the ropes, along with his teammates and coaches. Just what this professional life is all about and how to prepare every day ... super-duper cool.' Bronny James' ascent to the ranks of the NBA has been made all the more remarkable given that just over a year ago he suffered a cardiac arrest during a workout with his University of Southern California college team-mates. James Sr. said his son's swift recovery from that life-threatening episode had convinced him that he would one day play in the NBA. 'To see him play in a college Division I game the same year he had heart surgery ... I knew that at that moment that there really was going to be nothing to stop him from anything that he wants to do,' James said. Bronny said at the Lakers recent media day he was fueled by the words of critics who have suggested he owes his place on the Lakers roster entirely to his superstar father. 'I'm just taking all that stuff, that criticism and backlash that people have given me and turning it into something that can fuel me,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebron-bronny-james-make-nba-history-with-father-son-appearance/7835473.html	2024-10-22T23:04:38-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine trade drone attacks	Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it destroyed 14 Ukrainian aerial drones in areas along the Ukraine-Russia border as well as four uncrewed Ukrainian boats in the Black Sea. The ministry said Russian air defenses destroyed 10 drones over Russia-occupied Crimea, and another four over the Rostov region. Russian forces carried out a second consecutive night of heavy drone attacks targeting the Sumy region in southern Ukraine. The Sumy regional military administration said Wednesday that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 19 Russian drones, a night after Ukraine downed 25 drones in the same area. Officials in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Mykolaiv regions also reported drones being shot down overnight. North Korean involvement Ukraine has 'information that two units of military personnel from North Korea are being trained — potentially even two brigades of 6,000 people each' — for combat in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday. 'This is a challenge,' the president said in his daily address. 'But we know how to respond to this challenge. And it is important that our partners do not shy away from this challenge, as well.' 'If North Korea can intervene in the war in Europe, then the pressure on this regime is definitely not strong enough,' Zelenskyy said. 'And if Russia is still able to expand and prolong this war, it means that everyone in the world who is still not helping to force Russia into peace is actually helping Putin to wage war.' 'We expect a firm, concrete response from the world,' he added. 'Hopefully, not only in words.' Also Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement that Russia is playing with lives beyond Ukraine. 'Russia’s indiscriminate strikes on ports in the Black Sea underscore that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is willing to gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission. ... In doing so, he is harming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East to try and gain the upper hand in his barbaric war.' Starmer said Russia’s conduct in the conflict has shown 'no respect for human life or the consequences of their invasion across the world.'

Thousands flee homes as fierce tropical storm batters Philippines	Manila, Philippines — Philippine rescuers waded through chest-deep floodwaters Wednesday to reach residents trapped by Tropical Storm Trami, which has forced thousands to evacuate as it barrels towards the country's east coast. Torrential rains driven by the storm have turned streets into rivers, submerged entire villages and buried some vehicles up to their door handles in volcanic sediment knocked loose by the downpour. At least 32,000 people had fled their homes in the northern Philippines, police said, as the storm edged closer to the Southeast Asian country's main island of Luzon. In the Bicol region, about 400 kilometers southeast of the capital Manila, 'unexpectedly high' flooding was complicating rescue efforts, said police. 'We sent police rescue teams but they struggled to enter some areas because the flooding was high and the current was so strong,' regional police spokeswoman Luisa Calubaquib told AFP. Trami's center was 310 kilometers east of Aurora province with maximum sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour as of 8 a.m., the national weather agency said. Photos verified by AFP showed streets submerged by muddy floodwaters in Camarines Sur province's Bato municipality, with only the roofs of houses and convenience stores visible. 'It's getting dangerous. We're waiting for rescuers,' resident Karen Tabagan told AFP. In Naga city, about 40 kilometers from Bato, half of the 600 villages were fully submerged by flooding. At an emergency meeting of government agencies Wednesday morning, President Ferdinand Marcos said that 'the worst is yet to come.' 'I'm feeling a little helpless here because ... all we can do is sit tight, wait, hope and pray that there is not too much damage, that there are no casualties.' Families driven from their homes in Bicol were staying at around 2,500 evacuation centres scattered across the region. 'There was also a lahar flow in Albay due to the rains,' Calubaquib, the Bicol police spokeswoman said, referring to the volcanic sediment flowing from the Philippines' famous Mayon volcano. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-flee-homes-as-fierce-tropical-storm-batters-philippines/7835468.html	2024-10-22T22:45:13-07:00	
Giuliani ordered to turn over NYC apartment, 26 watches to Georgia election workers	Rudy Giuliani must turn over sports memorabilia and other prized possessions to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him, including his New York City apartment, more than two dozen luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall, a judge ruled Tuesday. But U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan also said Giuliani does not have to give the election workers three New York Yankees World Series rings or his Florida condominium — for now — noting those assets are tied up in other litigation. The property Giuliani must relinquish is expected to fetch several million dollars for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss. They won the $148 million judgment over Giuliani's false ballot fraud claims against them related to the 2020 presidential election. They said Giuliani pushed Donald Trump's lies about the election being stolen, which led to death threats that made them fear for their lives. Under Tuesday's order, Giuliani must relinquish within seven days his Manhattan apartment, estimated at more than $5 million, as well as his interest in about $2 million that he says Trump's 2020 presidential campaign owes him for his services. Also on the list of assets that must be given to Freeman and Moss are a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500 previously owned by Bacall; a shirt and picture signed, respectively, by Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson; a signed Yankee Stadium picture; a diamond ring; costume jewelry and 26 watches including a Rolex, five Shinolas, two Bulovas and a Tiffany & Co. In court documents filed earlier this year, Giuliani estimated the Mercedes was worth about $25,000, and the watches, World Series rings and costume jewelry at about $30,000. He said the value of his sports memorabilia was unknown. One of those watches was given to Giuliani by his grandfather and he asked that he be allowed to keep it because of its sentimental value. But Liman rejected the request, saying Giuliani could have had it exempted if he had proven it was worth less than $1,000 — but he did not do so. 'The Court also does not doubt that certain of the items may have sentimental value to Defendant,' the judge added. 'But that does not entitle Defendant to continued enjoyment of the assets to the detriment of the Plaintiffs to whom he owes approximately $150 million. It is, after all, the underlying policy of these New York statutes that 'no man should be permitted to live at the same time in luxury and in debt.'' Liman wrote that Freeman and Moss would be allowed to sell off the property and 'ensure that the liquidation of the transferred assets is accomplished quickly.' Giuliani had asked the judge to bar Freeman and Moss from selling any of his assets until after his appeal of the judgment is completed. Liman also rejected that request, saying Giuliani could have asked the federal court in Washington, D.C., where Freeman and Moss won their case, to stay any asset sales pending his appeal, but he did not. Giuliani's lawyers, Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski, said in a statement Tuesday night, 'Stay tuned. When the judgment is reversed in the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., these Plaintiffs will be required to return all this property to Mr. Giuliani. We repeat, stay tuned.' To date, Giuliani has not paid Freeman and Moss anything. 'We are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani's actions,' Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss, said in a statement. 'This outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.' As for the World Series rings, Giuliani's son, Andrew, filed court documents earlier this month saying he actually is the rightful owner. He said his father gave him four rings — one for each of the Yankees' championships in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 — as gifts in 2018. Rudy Giuliani received the rings during his tenure as mayor of New York City. The younger Giuliani's claim is pending in federal court in Manhattan. Freeman and Moss also asked Liman to order Rudy Giuliani to turn over his condo in Palm Beach, Florida, estimated to be worth more than $3 million. But that property is tied up in other litigation, with Giuliani claiming it should be exempt because it is his primary residence. Freeman and Moss have a lien on the Florida property. Liman said he would take up the Florida condo at a hearing Oct. 28, and he barred Giuliani from selling the property or taking any action that would diminish its value. After the $148 million verdict, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, which froze attempts by Freeman and Moss to collect the award. But a judge in July threw out the case citing repeated 'uncooperative conduct,' including a failure to comply with court orders and disclose sources of income.	https://www.voanews.com/a/giuliani-ordered-to-turn-over-nyc-apartment-26-watches-to-georgia-election-workers/7835441.html	2024-10-22T19:59:37-07:00	
E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald's Quarter Pounder kills 1, sickens dozens in US	One person died and dozens fell ill from E. coli infections linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers in 10 states, led by Colorado, where 26 people were sickened, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said on Tuesday. The E. coli outbreak, linked to one of McDonald's most popular menu items, has sickened 49 people and sent 10 to the hospital, officials say. The strain involved, E. coli O157:H7, can cause serious illness and was the source of a 1993 outbreak that killed four children who ate undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants. Shares of the world's largest fast-food chain were down about 6% in extended trading. A livestock trader said the outbreak also could pressure U.S. cattle futures on Wednesday by threatening demand for beef. Everyone interviewed as part of an investigation into the outbreak has reported eating at McDonald's before their illness started, and most mentioned eating a Quarter Pounder hamburger, according to the CDC. The specific ingredient linked to the illness has not been identified but investigators are focused on fresh, slivered onions and fresh beef patties, the CDC said. Most of the illnesses were reported in Colorado and Nebraska. 'The initial findings from the investigation indicate that a subset of illnesses may be linked to slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder and sourced by a single supplier that serves three distribution centers,' McDonald's North America Chief Supply Chain Officer Cesar Piña said in a statement. McDonald's has proactively removed the slivered onions and beef patties used for the Quarter Pounder hamburgers from stores in the affected states while the investigation continues, the company informed the CDC. U.S. food safety attorney Bill Marler, who represented a victim in the Jack in the Box outbreak, said more cases of illness could surface. Onions have been linked to prior E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks, he said. According to Marler, a founder of Marler Clark in Seattle, beef contamination is less common due to food safety measures. 'You'd have to have multiple restaurants under-cooking the meat,' he said. McDonald's is temporarily removing the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in the impacted areas, including Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming, it said in a statement, adding it was working with suppliers to replenish supply in the coming week. Symptoms for E. coli include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Most people who suffer an infection will start feeling sick three to four days after eating or drinking something that contains the bacteria, Colorado's public health department said. However, illnesses can start anywhere from one to 10 days after exposure, the department added. In 2015, burrito chain Chipotle saw its sales battered and reputation hit due to E.coli outbreaks in several states. That outbreak was linked to a different strain of E. coli that typically causes less severe illness than E. coli O157:H7. In addition to Colorado, the CDC said small clusters of a few people fell ill after eating a Quarter Pounder in Nebraska, Utah and Wyoming. Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Iowa, Wisconsin and Montana had one illness apiece.	https://www.voanews.com/a/e-coli-outbreak-tied-to-mcdonald-s-quarter-pounder-kills-1-sickens-dozens-in-us/7835436.html	2024-10-22T19:49:28-07:00	
Tunisia's president inaugurated for second term	Tunisian President Kais Saied was inaugurated for a second term following a tumultuous first term in which he suspended parliament, jailed his critics and rewrote the country's constitution. In his inaugural address Monday before parliament, Saied called for a 'cultural revolution' designed to fight terrorism, reduce unemployment and erase corruption. 'The aim is to build a country where everyone can live in dignity,' he said. Saied won a little more than 90% of the votes, but that triumph was spoiled by a reported low voter turnout of 28.8%. Out of 14 presidential hopefuls, only three ended up on the ballot: One was in prison, one was a close acquaintance of Saied, and the third was Saied. Saied rose to power in 2019 when he mounted a presidential campaign with very little money and a populist message of rooting out cronyism and returning power to the people, a notion that resonated with an electorate fed up with years of dysfunctional governance. However, in 2021, Saied suspended parliament, rewrote the North African country's constitution, increased presidential powers and reduced legislative ones. A crackdown on the opposition followed. Under his presidency, authorities detained or imprisoned dozens of opposition politicians, activists and journalists, dismissed judges and prosecutors, and weakened free expression and judicial independence. Even though the president also cracked down on corruption, analysts say new forms found root and flourished. Earlier this year, Tunisia renewed the crackdown on protesters who denounced what they said was their country's deteriorating economic and political state. Meanwhile, Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said Tunisian officials have 'systematically' placed 'obstacle after obstacle in the way of a fair election and opposition candidates being able to campaign for president freely.' Khawaja said that 'after mass arrests and targeting prospective contenders,' Tunisian authorities changed 'the electoral law just days before the election, cutting off avenues for meaningful oversight and appeal.' On Tuesday, the lawyer for imprisoned opposition presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel told Agence France-Presse that Zammel has received more time, increasing his sentence to more than 30 years. After Zammel's arrest, the European Union condemned what it called 'a continued limitation of democratic space in Tunisia.' The EU's criticism also came after Tunisia's election board ignored a court decision that granted the appeals of three other presidential candidates to have their names in the race. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-president-inaugurated-for-second-term/7835406.html	2024-10-22T18:16:33-07:00	
Murders of Sikhs spotlight sect's long history in Canada	A high-profile murder trial over the 2022 shooting death of Vancouver-based Ripudaman Singh Malik, which coincides with other crimes that Canadian law enforcement officials have linked to the government of Indian President Narendra Modi, has renewed interest in the largest Sikh diaspora outside of India. Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez — both of British Columbia and in their mid-20s with lengthy criminal histories — recently confessed to the contract killing of Malik but remained silent over who hired them to do it, according to a statement released by British Columbia's Supreme Court on Monday. Malik, a prime suspect in the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight from Montreal to Mumbai, had since been acquitted of the terror charges and remained a vocal advocate for an independent Khalistan, a proposed separatist sovereign enclave for Sikh followers in the Indian state of Punjab. The trial over Malik's killing is unfolding alongside another trial over the June 2023 murder in suburban Vancouver of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who'd been organizing a local referendum to generate support for Khalistan's secession. India strongly denies the accusations and last week each country expelled six of the other's diplomats, including India's ambassador in Ottawa. The animosity between India and local supporters of Khalistan can be traced back to the bombing of two Air India aircraft in 1985. Organized in the Vancouver area, the bombings involved two Air India 747s — one exploding in flight off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 on board, the other fatally wounding two baggage handlers at Narita International Airport near Tokyo. Those bombings — the deadliest acts of aviation terrorism prior to September 11, 2001 — are widely believed to have been carried out by Canadian-based Sikhs in retaliation for India's deadly 1984 storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine in the Sikh religion. Canada is home to the world's largest diaspora of Sikh faithful outside of India. An estimated 300,000 reside in the province of Ontario, with nearly as many in British Columbia and just over 100,000 in neighboring Alberta. Satwinder Bains, director of the South Asian Studies Institute at the University of the Fraser Valley in suburban Vancouver, said that, historically, immigrants from Punjab first traveled through Canada in 1897, when both were closely linked with Britain. There was an early surge of immigration starting in 1903 and then a much larger wave in the 1970s. Bains said these migrants, unlike many other immigrant groups, often came with money and their families still owned land back in India. Many of these newcomers continued the family tradition of farming and being agriculturalists by buying land in Canada. They kept in touch with relatives back home and wanted to have a say in the politics of not only their new homeland, but also India. 'So, I would say it's very unique,' Bains, who is of the Sikh faith, told VOA. 'Some immigrants, like refugees that come from Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia ... [aren't] involved in the politics of that country in the same way. And also, there's a bit of, you know, old aggression in us, from being invaded in the North-West Frontier Province of India.' Bains also points to high levels of political engagement in the diaspora, which lost the right to vote in Canada from 1907 to 1947 along with other minority groups of the time. She said Sikh immigrants in Canada have been very successful in not only agriculture, but also in finance, and politics. 'Business has been the strongest,' she said. 'We're very savvy financially — very savvy, economically — very smart. 'The other area of industry is politics. We are very politically active, engaged.' Beyond his onetime vocal advocacy for an independent Khalistan, Malik was a prominent businessman, serving as president of the Surrey-based Khalsa Credit Union and chairman of the private Khalsa School, supervising its campuses in Surrey and Vancouver. In more recent years, he had seemed to make amends with the government of India. Anne Murphy is a professor and chair of Punjabi Language, Literature and Sikh studies at the University of British Columbia. She said the campaign for an independent Khalistan can be traced back to the partition of India in 1947 and decolonization. Feeling persecuted, Sikh followers in Canada and around the world started to seek a safe place to call home. She said it is vital to note that although many of Canada's Sikh faithful are critical of India, not all support the idea of a secessionist Khalistan. 'So, I would say that the Sikh community, like many other very, very dynamic and vibrant communities, has many different positions in it,' she told VOA. Still, the diplomatic rift between Canada and India appears to be far from over. The trial of Nijjar's four accused killers has yet to take place and U.S. prosecutors have charged Vikash Yadav, an ex-intelligence official for the Indian government, with trying to assassinate a proponent of Khalistan in New York. Authorities in Canada and the United States have publicly stated they are working together on both investigations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/murders-of-sikhs-spotlight-sect-s-long-history-in-canada/7833381.html	2024-10-22T18:02:37-07:00	
Ukraine's prosecutor general resigns following draft-dodging scandal	Ukraine's prosecutor general announced his resignation Tuesday amid charges that his office provided exemptions to the military draft for government officials. 'Many shameful facts of abuse have been established within the system of the prosecutor's offices of Ukraine,' Andriy Kostin said in a statement. Kostin's resignation followed a meeting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held with senior officials concerning the issuance of disability certificates. The certificates allowed officials throughout the government to avoid military service at a time when the country is struggling to recruit soldiers for its fight against Russia. 'The prosecutor general must take political responsibility for the situation in the prosecution bodies of Ukraine,' Zelenskyy said in a statement after the meeting. 'The problem is not only that officials use their connections to obtain disability status,' the president said in his daily address. 'The problem is also that people with real disabilities, in particular those disabled in combat, are often unable to get proper status and fair payments.' Zelenskyy said a full audit has been conducted on 'the pensions and other accruals' that government officials were able to acquire with the faulty disability exemptions. Sixty-four officials within the Medical and Social Expert Commission have been notified that they are being investigated for illegally issuing disability certificates, according to the SBU, Ukraine's domestic security service. Nine have been tried and found guilty. The president has ordered an overhaul of the disability assessment system. Some information for this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-prosecutor-general-resigns-following-draft-dodging-scandal/7833104.html	2024-10-22T17:33:47-07:00

Media hub to offer equipment, training to Myanmar media	bangkok — Myanmar journalists are being offered resources including equipment and training as part of a new initiative. Set up by Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, and the Exile Hub, which supports human rights defenders who fled their home countries, the Myanmar Press Freedom Project will work to support journalists from Myanmar who are in exile or still reporting under harsh conditions inside the country. 'Through the Myanmar Press Freedom Project, RSF will aim to provide equipment such as laptops, phones, camera, solar batteries, digital security tools as well as provide access to technical editing equipment for video-based Myanmar journalists,' said Shataakshi Verma, a project manager at RSF. 'The project will also aim to provide capacity training for Myanmar journalists in order for them to continue reporting safely.' The need for resources and support has increased since February of 2021 when a military coup in Myanmar led to a media crackdown, with dozens of journalists detained. Reporters also are at risk while covering the conflict between the junta and the various armed resistance fighters battling military rule. Hein Thar, a freelance journalist formerly at Frontier Myanmar, told VOA the project will benefit citizen journalists. 'I think it's good. It's better than giving nothing, especially for citizen journalists who don't have their own laptops or phones. I understand this is the first step. I think it's for the basic needs, and they're giving the basic support,' he said. Perilous work Reporting on the conflict has become a dangerous profession. The military has detained at least 150 media workers, said RSF, with at least 64 currently imprisoned, including a contributor for VOA. Journalists are often accused of violating section 505(a) of Myanmar's criminal code, which outlaws publishing or circulating content deemed to cause fear, spread false news or agitate crimes against a government employee. The law carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. RSF said the military is responsible for the deaths of seven journalists and press freedom defenders since 2021. But the risks for journalists are high on either side, as two reporters are believed to be held by the Kachin Independence Army — one of the ethnic groups fighting against the junta — after being taken captive separately in late September, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Hein Thar has said journalists working on the frontlines of Myanmar's conflict need training. 'The majority of journalists don't have the proper training,' he said. 'We didn't prepare anything for conflict, war reporting and so on. We hope for the professional training from the experienced journalists who report in Afghanistan or Syria.' Gains come with risks Forces opposing junta rule have made significant territorial gains in the past 12 months. As the resistance fights back, these major developments are crucial for news outlets covering the chaos — but that brings risk. For journalists, that includes crossing military checkpoints. Some reporters now carry more than one phone and less equipment, to reduce the risk if apprehended. Toe Zaw Latt, who works for Mizzima, said journalists rely more on smartphones now. 'We are using a phone and editing it,' Toe Zaw Latt told VOA. Zaw Latt, who is also the general secretary at the Independent Press Council Myanmar, said journalists need help with internet communication and safety gear, such as flak jackets and protective helmets. The issues that are top of mind for him are how to get the content out in a safe manner. 'If you have footage, how are you going to send it back?' he said. 'I'm more interested in safety protection, and maybe emergency relocation.' His outlet, Mizzima, is one of several that had a license revoked by the military and now works in exile. Media outlets in Myanmar must be registered with the military government in order to operate. But when journalists register for press accreditation, they must provide their personal details, which discourages many to register for fear of arrest. Unaccredited or citizen reporters in Myanmar are then further at risk, spurring an increase in journalists working under the radar or even outside of the country's borders. Several media outlets had to downsize and move overseas, mostly to stay safe and still cover the conflict. RSF's representative Verma told VOA the watchdog has assessed the need for training and intends to provide it. 'The project will also aim to provide capacity training for Myanmar journalists in order for them to continue reporting safely,' Verma wrote via WhatsApp. The coup wiped out nearly a decade of media freedom gains in Myanmar, which ranks at 171 out of 180 — where 1 shows the best environment — on the World Press Freedom Index. In 2020, a year before the coup, it ranked 139.	https://www.voanews.com/a/media-hub-to-offer-equipment-training-to-myanmar-media/7833062.html	2024-10-22T16:55:04-07:00	
Two transgender women stabbed to death at home in northwest Pakistan	PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Two men armed with daggers killed two transgender women at their home in conservative northwest Pakistan overnight before fleeing the scene, police said, a sign of increasing violence against trans people in the country. The killings happened Sunday night in Mardan, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Fahim Khan said. He said the motive behind the killings was unclear and officers are still investigating, and the victims had been buried at a local graveyard. Khan said two suspects had also been arrested in connection with the killings, but he refused to share any further details. Khan also refused to confirm or deny whether the men were directly involved in the attack. Transgender people are often subjected to harassment, abuse and attacks in Muslim-majority Pakistan. They are also among the victims of so-called honor killings carried out by relatives to punish perceived sexual transgressions. However, Pakistan's parliament in 2018 adopted the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act to secure the fundamental rights of transgender Pakistanis, including their access to legal gender recognition. But many in the country have entrenched beliefs on gender and sexuality, and trans people are often considered outcasts. Some are forced into begging, dancing and prostitution to earn money. They also live in fear of attacks. Pakistani authorities have also issued identification cards to transgender people. Farzana Jan, president of the TransAction rights group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said that another nine trans people have been killed in gun attacks in the province since January. She said that none of the attackers involved in the previous cases had been brought to justice, mainly because prosecutors didn't pursue the cases seriously. The transgender community has threatened to protest if the attackers aren't arrested. 'We have given a three-day deadline to the police for arresting those behind the latest killings in Mardan,' Jan said. 'We will stage rallies if the killers of two members of our community are not arrested.' Mardan is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Peshawar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-transgender-women-stabbed-to-death-at-home-in-northwest-pakistan/7833103.html	2024-10-22T16:51:02-07:00

Guinea-Bissau media face crackdown ahead of November election	In Guinea-Bissau, the 21-day sprint to Election Day begins November 2 and both politicians and journalists are preparing for a hotly contested campaign. The high-stakes election season brings with it logistical and ethical challenges for reporters. Media organizations are preparing coverage proposals to present to international partners, particularly the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). These proposals often include requests for per diems to pay for transportation, food, lodging and communication for journalists. This practice has long been common in Guinea-Bissau, where media outlets lack the financial resources to independently cover elections. As a result, many will either accept or turn to political candidates or parties for travel support, creating a relationship that compromises journalistic independence. To maintain impartiality, media outlets are increasingly seeking support from international and regional organizations. The UNDP has been supporting media organizations in Guinea-Bissau with some funding, though the exact amount varies. During the 2023 parliamentary elections, UNDP provided financial aid to several outlets, including radio stations Sol Mansi, Jovem and Bombolom, as well as newspapers O Democrata, Capital News and Última Hora. Each received about $2,500, according to a VOA reporter in the country. UNDP has also been promoting civic education, working through the National Elections Commission, which partners directly with media outlets. Despite these efforts, the Union of Journalists and Media Technicians (SINDICATO dos Jornalistas e Técnicos da Comunicação Social) reported that their recent attempts to obtain additional support from international bodies, including the United Nations, the EU, and ECOWAS, have been unsuccessful. Guinea-Bissau also faces issues including the influence of powerful drug traffickers and organized crime. In 2023, President Umaro Sissoco Embalo dissolved the opposition-dominated parliament after what he termed a coup attempt. Voters also face pressing social issues such as the cost of living, access to health care and education. The government has summoned private media organizations, demanding $5,000 for a license to continue broadcasting. This issue has surfaced before, and in response, the Forum of Private Media Organizations, or FOCSP-GB, prepared a counterproposal to present to the government. The proposal suggests that commercial radio stations and newspapers in Guinea-Bissau pay $3,000 for a license, with a $1,000 biannual renewal fee. For community radio stations, the proposal suggests a one-time payment of $500 for a license, with no need for renewal, acknowledging the important role these stations play in their communities. The government has yet to comment or respond to the proposal. Many radio stations have been unable to raise the $5,000 needed to secure their licenses before the elections. Four political parties and three coalitions are competing in the November 24 contest. Guinea-Bissau’s political system has been severely strained in recent years by divisions between the president and the parliament, as well as infighting within the main political party. Corruption remains a major issue, advocates say, worsened by the corrosive influence of drug traffickers. 'Corruption is widespread, including among senior government officials, and both military and civilian officers have been charged with involvement in illegal drug trafficking,' wrote the nonprofit organization Freedom House this month. It highlighted the case of Malam Bacai Sanha Jr., the son of a former president, who pleaded guilty in a U.S. court in September 2023 to charges that he was leading an international drug trafficking network. At the time, he was accused of planning to use the drug profits to finance a coup in his home country. Freedom House also documented efforts to intimidate media outlets, writing that in recent years, 'armed men — some dressed in military clothes — have repeatedly attacked the private station Radio Capital FM, which is allied with the PAIGC [African Independence Party for Guinea and Cape Verde], vandalizing its offices and destroying broadcasting equipment.' Freedom House reported that, in December 2023, 'in the sequence of the alleged coup attempt, armed men and in military uniforms invaded state television and radio stations and ordered them to be removed from the air; a few hours later, the men sent technicians to the stations to broadcast music and then a news segment about the dissolution of parliament by the president.' The application of 'exorbitant' private radio licensing fees is identified as a threat to press freedom, especially when legal default can lead to up to three years in prison for the station owner. In April 2022, Freedom House said the government ordered the closure of 79 radio stations for lack of payment of licensing fees, and 'all stations, except for two, resumed the broadcast later that month, after civil society organizations helped them negotiate staggered payments to the Government.' In its latest report this month, the group also addresses the dissolution of parliament in December 2023. 'The military apparently refrained from interfering in politics in the years following 2014, although they were used by President [Umaro Sissoco ] Embalo to complete his term,' the report said. It added that 'voters and politicians’ choices continue to be influenced by corruption and the networks of clientelism.' Corruption is widespread in the country, including among senior government officials. 'Judges are highly susceptible to corruption and political pressure, and the judicial system as a whole lacks resources and the ability to function effectively,' the report said, adding there are 'multiple restrictions on personal social freedoms.' VOA reached out to the office of the president, but inquiries went unanswered. Reporters have also faced aggression from security forces. In September, Julio Oliveira, a photojournalist for the Lusa News Agency, was detained by the Rapid Intervention Police, attacked, threatened to be taken to the police station and forced to erase all the images he had on his camera. He had been filming a caravan that accompanied former prime minister and opposition leader Domingo Simoes Pereira to his residence in the center of Bissau. Lusa denounced the attack, saying it was 'shocked by the unexpected and inexplicable aggression' to its photojournalist. 'These types of procedures cannot fail to deserve the most vehement condemnation of the Lusa Board of Directors, finding themselves in violation of the most elementary principles of freedom of information and press, as well as the rule of law,' it said in a statement. In August, during the swearing in of the new Cabinet, the president told the new Minister of Social Communication Florentino Fernando Dias, 'Your role, Minister Florentino, is not to close the radio stations, but they must be legal and must pay the contributions to the state.' Embalo urged him to 'help the journalists' unions so that they are legal, because the union regulates the conduct of the professionals of the sector, prevents someone from proclaiming himself journalist only because he has an internet and a telephone.' However, tensions continue, with journalists complaining of being barred from covering official events. In an incident in July, Embalo used profanity toward journalists upon arriving at the airport following a trip to China. Watchdog groups say the country is increasingly becoming a dangerous place for the media, and restrictions are preventing citizens from accessing important information. 'The situation of Guinea-Bissauan journalists is dramatic,' said Sadibou Marong, the sub-Saharan Africa bureau director for the press freedom nonprofit Reporters Without Borders. 'The president of the republic displays a disastrous attitude toward the media.'

Exclusive: Facing cash crunch, Hezbollah seeks to boost illegal drug sales in Europe	washington — Hezbollah is seeking to quickly boost sales of illegal drugs in Europe, former U.S. officials tell VOA, as the Iran-backed Lebanese militia reels from a weekslong Israeli offensive that has destroyed and disrupted its key sources of cash in Lebanon. International law enforcement officials tell VOA, though, the U.S.-designated terror group faces some challenges in ramping up its European drug trafficking operations. Hezbollah has plunged into a financial crisis since Israel began escalating its attacks on the group’s leaders and infrastructure in Lebanon in late September, according to U.S. and Lebanese sources who spoke with VOA earlier this month. Those attacks include Sunday’s Israeli airstrikes on branches of Hezbollah’s quasi-banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan in Hezbollah-dominated parts of Lebanon including the group’s southern Beirut stronghold. Israel’s offensive follows 11 months of limiting its responses to Hezbollah attacks on the country’s north in support of Iran-backed terror group Hamas, which invaded southern Israel from Gaza last October, sparking the year-old war in the Palestinian territory. The former U.S. officials, who spoke exclusively to VOA about Hezbollah’s international drug trafficking activities, said their sources in Europe have reported an uptick of interest by Hezbollah in selling illicit drugs on the continent this month. Hezbollah operates a global criminal-financial network, with hubs in Africa and Latin America, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service. The European Union’s agency for law enforcement cooperation, Europol, said in a 2022 report that Hezbollah also uses the EU as a 'base for fundraising, recruitment and criminal activities from which they obtain significant profits.' Hezbollah has built a 'network of collaborators' in the EU, suspected of 'managing the transportation and distribution of illegal drugs ... and running professional money laundering operations,' the Europol report said. 'I have talked to several Europe-based traffickers who were arrested in the past and recruited as sources for law enforcement and are now back on the streets,' said David Asher, a former U.S. Defense and State Department official who targeted Hezbollah’s global drug trafficking and money laundering networks, in an October 9 interview. 'They told me they are being contacted to arrange illicit drug deliveries on behalf of Hezbollah-affiliated actors as fast as possible,' Asher said. 'It does not mean there already is an uptick in narcotics on the street, but I would expect it because Hezbollah’s money is in peril in Lebanon, and they need to raise more through illicit means.' Thomas Cindric, a retired special agent of the U.S. Justice Department’s Drug Enforcement Administration who served at the DEA from 1996 to 2018, told VOA on Monday that people associated with the illegal drug trade also have reported to him an uptick of Hezbollah-related drug trafficking activity in Europe in the past 10 days. An international law enforcement official who spoke with VOA last Friday and requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue, said organized crime groups linked to Hezbollah 'no doubt will try to increase their activity' because Hezbollah is under financial pressure. 'When you are getting hit the way that Hezbollah is getting hit right now by the Israelis, the only way you can make money exponentially fast is with illegal drugs,' Cindric said. VOA contacted the U.S. Justice and Homeland Security departments last week to ask if they have made similar observations about Hezbollah but got no response. The Biden administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on individuals and organizations affiliated with Hezbollah as part of an effort to disrupt the group's illicit revenue-generating international activities and dismantle its financial network. Selling illegal drugs in Europe is a quick way for Hezbollah to raise money because of ample demand and supply, according to Hans-Jakob Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a U.S.-German nonprofit policy organization. 'Europe is the largest consumer of cocaine worldwide, bigger than the United States, so the demand is there,' said Schindler, a former U.N. Security Council and German government official. On the supply side, Schindler said Hezbollah has established relationships with South American drug cartels who ship their illicit cargos to West Africa, from where they are transported first to Africa’s northern coast and then to Europe’s southern coast. 'Unlike drug trafficking, Hezbollah’s other money-making ventures are not easy to ramp up quickly,' Schindler said. Hezbollah-linked companies engaged in commercial activities likely would be unable to double their profits in a matter of days, while the group also would find it hard to rapidly increase its donations from and its extortion of the Lebanese diaspora, he said. Quentin Mugg, a French police officer in Europol and author of the French book 'Argent Sale' (Dirty Money) about his work in fighting organized crime, told VOA in a Friday interview that a Hezbollah plan to expedite drug trafficking in Europe is plausible. 'I know from past cases that Lebanese or Lebanese-origin criminals in Europe with apparent Hezbollah affiliations were laundering the proceeds of illegal drug sales and diverting some of the profits to Hezbollah,' Mugg said. 'So, we know that Hezbollah was profiting from this money laundering in a structured kind of way. With that in mind, seeking to expedite this activity makes sense,' he said. The international law enforcement official who spoke to VOA said one challenge Hezbollah faces in boosting the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug sales is competition from other organized crime groups active on the continent. 'It is quite competitive out there, so Hezbollah might not be successful,' the official said. Mugg said Hezbollah and its associates also will run into aggressive policing by Europol, which is targeting encrypted communications to reveal big traffickers’ identities. 'Seizures of illegal drugs have been rising dramatically in the past few years. So, European law enforcement activity is really thriving,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-hezbollah-facing-cash-crunch-seeks-to-boost-illegal-drug-sales-in-europe-/7832984.html	2024-10-22T15:09:27-07:00	
Iraq says it killed top Islamic State group figure	Baghdad — Iraqi forces have killed nine Islamic State group commanders, including the militants’ top figure in the country, Baghdad announced Tuesday, with the Pentagon saying two U.S. troops were injured during the raid. Iraq's Joint Operations Command said in a statement that counterterrorism forces 'killed nine terrorists, among them the so-called governor of Iraq' for IS, naming him as Jassim al-Mazroui Abu Abdel Qader. The statement said the raid in the northern Hamrin Mountains was carried out 'with technical support' and intelligence provided by the U.S.-led anti-jihadi coalition and said that 'large quantities of weapons' were seized in the operation which was 'still ongoing.' Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said that U.S. Central Command and Iraqi forces 'conducted a partner raid in Iraq targeting several senior ISIS leaders' overnight. 'The raid resulted in the death of multiple ISIS operatives,' he told journalists, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. 'We do have reports of two U.S. service members that were injured,' Ryder said, adding that 'both of them are in stable condition being treated for their injuries.' The IS group overran large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria in 2014, proclaiming its 'caliphate.' It was defeated in Iraq in 2017 by local forces backed by the international military coalition, and in 2019 lost the last territory it held in Syria to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. But remnants of the group remain active in Iraq and continue to launch sporadic attacks. A statement from the office of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced 'the killing of the so-called governor of Iraq and eight senior leaders of the terrorist Daesh organization,' using the Arabic acronym for IS. Sudani said the operation targeted IS hideouts in the Hamrin Mountains, vowing to 'pursue ... and eliminate' jihadists wherever they may be in Iraq. Iraqi security forces, supported by the U.S.-led coalition, have carried out numerous raids on suspected IS hideouts. The U.S. military announced on Friday that 'precision airstrikes' conducted by Iraqi forces earlier this month had killed a senior IS leader and three other militants. At the end of August, a joint operation by U.S. and Iraqi forces killed 15 IS group fighters in Iraq's western desert. A report by United Nations experts published in July estimated there were around 1,500 to 3,000 militants remaining in Iraq and Syria. The United States has about 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria as part of the coalition, which Washington and Baghdad announced last month will end its decade-long military mission in Iraq within a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-says-it-killed-top-islamic-state-group-figure-/7833010.html	2024-10-22T14:57:10-07:00	
Made in China’ election merchandise floods US market	WASHINGTON — As the United States presidential election enters its final phase, more and more voters are expressing support for their favored candidate by wearing election merchandise. What they may not realize is that the 'Make America Great Again' Trump hat or 'Childless Cat Lady for Harris' T-shirt they’re wearing quite possibly was made in China. With the help of e-commerce platforms, Chinese traders are flooding the market for U.S. election merchandise with cheap goods. Anecdotal evidence suggests U.S. makers of these products are struggling to compete. 'I think the amount of stuff on Amazon and Etsy that's coming from China and other countries in cargo ships and unloaded on American shores is drastically impacting American manufacturers’, like myself, ability to compete and grow our own business. I think it's dramatic,' said Ben Waxman, founder and co-owner of American Roots, an American apparel company. Waxman wouldn’t share production or profit figures with VOA Mandarin Service because of privacy concerns, but he did say his U.S.-made campaign T-shirts, for example, sell for about $15 each, while those on Chinese online retailer Temu can sell for as little as $3. 'It's more expensive when you pay higher wages, living wages, and abide by environmental standards,' Waxman said, referring to long-standing criticisms of China’s manufacturing practices. His unionized company has been producing campaign merchandise for presidential candidates since 2016, mainly T-shirts and sweatshirts, with all raw materials and production sourced within the U.S. Flooding the market VOA Mandarin Service was unable to find total sales figures for made-in-America election merchandise versus made-in-China ones. But the massive number of Chinese-made election products for sale on e-commerce platforms, including Amazon and eBay, show they are flooding the market. On Temu alone, tens of thousands of election-themed items have been sold at a fraction of the price of the official campaigns’ versions. Among them, a 'Make America Great Again' hat costs less than $4, while the official Trump campaign store website, which boasts 'All Products Made in the USA,' sells them for 10 times that price at $40 each. Likewise, Temu’s 'Kamala Harris 2024' hats can sell for less than $3 each, while the official Kamala Harris campaign store website sells 'Kamala' hats for $47 each. The Harris campaign also vowed to only sell products made in the U.S. on its official websites. VOA asked both campaigns for comment but didn't receive a response by the time of publication. The stark contrast in prices highlights the challenges the U.S. faces in reducing its dependence on Chinese products and closing a trade loophole, known as the de minimis loophole, that allows Chinese companies to ship goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. without paying import duties. Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a labor union-aligned organization, said abuse of the de minimis loophole is rampant, adding that her group 'lost 21 manufacturing operations over the last 18 months.' Glas said some of NCTO’s member manufacturers found sales of campaign products are slower this year than in any previous U.S. election cycle. VOA Mandarin reached out to Amazon and eBay for comments on the volume of presidential campaign merchandise imported from China on their websites and their regulations of the Chinese vendors but didn’t receive a response by the time of publication. Temu didn’t comment on election product sales in the U.S., but the company’s spokesperson replied in an email to VOA Mandarin, 'Temu's growth isn't dependent on the de minimis policy. The primary drivers behind our rapid expansion and market acceptance are the supply-chain efficiencies and operational proficiencies we've cultivated over the years.' The spokesperson added, 'We are open to and supportive of any policy adjustments made by legislators that align with consumer interests.' U.S. textile industry representatives note the irony of the two U.S. presidential candidates talking tough on trade with China while their own followers are buying China-made products to show their support for them. 'If someone is supporting a candidate because of that candidate's economic policy and their position toward improving our economy and improving our environment and improving our labor conditions, and doing so by increasing the amount of domestic manufacturing, and then they're supporting a candidate by buying a product that's made in a country that stands for the opposite of that, they're actually doing themselves and the candidate and the economy a disservice,' said Mitch Cahn, president of Unionwear, a New York-based apparel company that has supplied more than 300,000 baseball caps to Harris’ campaign. 'Anybody can make the product' Cahn notes that anyone can produce campaign products because the campaigns don't control their intellectual property. They think 'it's more valuable for them to have a person wear the campaign's name on their head than it is to make money from selling the merchandise.' 'When anybody can make the product and sell it, a lot of the products are going to end up being made in China because there's just not a lot of manufacturers here,' he told VOA Mandarin. The Associated Press reported on October 18 that thousands of Donald Trump's 'God Bless America' Bibles were printed in China. The AP also noted that most Bibles, not just the Trump-backed one, are made in China. Critics note Trump’s promotion of Made in the USA products could be undermined by the revelation. 'In past [election] years, this would've been a scandal,' says Marc Zdanow, a political consultant and CEO of Engage Voters U.S. 'I think Trump voters just don't care. ... I guess the question is whether or not this rises to the top for those voters who are still undecided. This issue is certainly one that could be enough to push this group away from Trump.' Chris Tang, a business administration and global management professor at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management, told VOA Mandarin the impact of merchandise made in China on the U.S. economy is not simply about one-sided manufacturing job losses. Consumers also get these products at low prices. 'While there are job losses in manufacturing, it creates opportunities for small businesses to import small quantities quickly using [online Chinese sellers like] Alibaba to find suppliers to produce election merchandise quickly and sell them online quickly.' Tang said the U.S. should develop a manufacturing sector that focuses on high-value products, not cheap ones such as U.S. election merchandise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/made-in-china-election-merchandise-floods-us-market/7832970.html	2024-10-22T14:36:51-07:00	
VOA interview: US Army General Costanza discusses Russia's threat to West	The war in Ukraine is reshaping the strategic landscape of Europe. While Western and Eastern European nations within the NATO alliance recognize the Russian threat, each day, NATO nations bordering Belarus and Russia feel the immediacy of the threat. In an exclusive interview with VOA’s Eastern Europe Bureau Chief Myroslava Gongadze, Lieutenant General Charles Costanza, commander of the U.S. Army’s V Corps (also known as the Fifth Corps) in Poland, discusses how NATO adapts to Russia’s evolving tactics while defending its members’ borders. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Can you explain the different threat assessments from Eastern and Western European partners of NATO regarding Russia? Charles Costanza, commanding general of the U.S. Army’s V Corps: Clearly, in the eastern flank of Europe, the threat is real. They're on the border with Belarus and Russia, and so, they see that threat every day differently. You see recent open-source reporting on the Russian UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] coming over Romanian territory and Lithuanian territory. Those incursions have increased. You see the sabotage operations going on throughout eastern flank countries and Eastern European countries. So, Russia is increasing that, short of ... challenges and interference [that would trigger the NATO mutual defense clause]. VOA: Do you think Russia is doing it deliberately? Costanza: Of course, they are. They weaponize immigration — I say 'weaponize' deliberately. This weaponized immigration is happening in Poland, it's all been driven from Russia to interfere in Eastern Europe. Moldova is a near-term example with their elections. Russia is actively interfering in those elections to try and shape them in a pro-Russian way. So, all that is going on right now. So, that's part of this threat assessment piece that isn't necessarily impacting the Western European countries as much as Eastern Europe. VOA: How threatening is Russia’s military? Costanza: I think there's a view that Russia is going to take three to 10 years to reconstitute, and I think that we need to look at that a little differently. Russian armed forces, ground forces right now, are actually bigger than they were before the war with Ukraine started 2½ years ago, despite the losses of open-source reporting [of] 600,000 casualties that they've incurred during the course of the war. They may not be as well trained, but they're bigger. Their industrial base is on a wartime footing. Their mobilization base is on a wartime footing. They know they're fighting a Western-trained, West-equipped country with Ukraine. They're learning how to defeat those capabilities and those systems over the last 2½ years. So, they're modernizing their force based on the lessons that they're learning, and I think that's something we should be concerned about. They're modernizing their equipment. They're changing the way that they fight based on learning how to fight against Western-trained forces in Ukraine. And I think that should be a concern for all of us. It clearly is to our Eastern European allies. VOA: How are you preparing to defend and deter? Costanza: First of all, to maintain a high stance on readiness from a U.S. forces standpoint but also the NATO standpoint. At the Fifth Corps, one of the key things we do as partners with our multinational corps and multinational divisions across the eastern flank of Europe [is] just to help build their war-fighting capability as they field new capabilities. HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System], for example. Apaches [helicopters] — with Poland just purchasing 96 Apaches from the United States. So, we help them to employ those things, those capabilities. But how you employ them at the corps level, and how you employ them at the division level, we can help, and we do. VOA: General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and now ambassador to the United Kingdom, recently gave a speech at Chatham House in London in which he talked about the technological advancements of this war, and how this is a different war than NATO was prepared to fight. How would you assess NATO’s capabilities today? Costanza: I think you're exactly right. And those are some of the comments that were made by our NATO partners in this event. I think that the United States is kind of setting the standard on that with a new program that our chief of staff of the Army [General Randy George] has talked about, which is transformation in contact. So, for the U.S. forces that are rotating over here to Europe, we're modernizing them with equipment that's available right now. So, instead of going through our normal four-year acquisition process to get new equipment, we're taking things that are available based on what we're watching happen in Ukraine. ... So maybe that can be a model for our partners and allies. VOA: We talked about NATO capabilities. Now I want to go back to Russian capabilities. How advanced do you think they are right now? Costanza: I think the biggest concern is what I said before: They know they're fighting Western-trained and -equipped forces. And so, as they modernize based on the lessons that they're learning — not just their equipment, but how they fight — they're really sharpening their ability to fight us in the future. And I think that's something we need to be concerned about. So, those things I just talked about that we're trying to rapidly introduce into our brigade to execute the transformation, contact — the UAS [Unmanned Aircraft Systems, or drones], the border, ammunition, the counter UAS, the EW [electronic warfare] capability. And how do you synchronize all of that capability so that you can really, rapidly strike and kill targets? They've learned how to do that. And so, we need to be able to do that and do it better than they do. VOA: Russia is gaining support from China and North Korea right now. Are we ready to face this threat? Costanza: The lessons that I was talking about, the reasons we should be concerned about Russia — they're sharing those lessons with China, with Iran, and vice versa, the capabilities that Iran and China are providing. And now you see the North Koreans, as well. North Korea is now providing, I think it's an initial batch [of] open-source reporting, of 4,000 North Korean soldiers. I think that could potentially just be a starting point for what they provide in terms of manpower to Russia. And I think that's a problem near-term here in Eastern Europe, because as we talked about before we started, the challenge for Ukrainians is people. It's the amount of people that they have to put into this fight. And Russia doesn't care how many losses it takes. I mean, 600,000 [casualties], and they're still throwing more manpower at it and don't even blink. Ukrainians can't afford to take those losses. I think that's going to be the limiting factor for that as we move forward, watch this war continue into this third period. VOA: There are different assessments of threats between, let's say, the political part of the NATO alliance and the military part of the alliance. How are you finding that common ground? Costanza: Yeah, I think it's just constant dialogue, right? And so, I know we do that at different levels. So, the combatant commander, the U.S. combat commander, has those discussions at the national levels with our NATO partners and allies. We all live in Eastern Europe, including myself — in Poland. We all see that threat the same way. It can be near term. VOA: What do you mean by the near term? Costanza: I think, one year, two years, three years. VOA: And you're trying to be ready for that? Costanza: U.S. forces are ready, and I can tell you, our NATO partners and allies are ready. And we're just continuing to build capabilities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voa-interview-us-army-general-costanza-discusses-russia-threat-to-west/7832923.html	2024-10-22T13:49:35-07:00	
US warns ramped-up election influence efforts aim to stoke violence	WASHINGTON — Efforts by U.S. adversaries to divide Americans and sow growing distrust in the upcoming presidential election have already begun to intensify, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, who warn some countries appear to be leaning toward additional measures to spark election-related violence. The latest declassified assessment, issued Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, comes just two weeks before voters head to the polls November 5 to choose a new president and vote on a series of statewide and local races and initiatives. 'Foreign actors — particularly Russia, Iran and China — remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in their interests,' according to the assessment. But it warns U.S. intelligence agencies are 'increasingly confident' that Russia is starting to engage in plans 'aimed at inciting violence.' It further assesses Iran also 'may try to incite violence.' Post-poll closing concerns Of particular concern is what appears to be a growing focus on the hours, days and weeks after the polls close, when state and local election officials begin to tally and certify the results. U.S. adversaries 'probably will be quick to create false narratives or amplify content they think will create confusion about the election, such as posting claims of election irregularities,' said a U.S. intelligence official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assessment in additional detail. The official said Russia, Iran and China 'may perceive a window of vulnerability to push disinformation or foment or amplify protests and threats' starting with the moment polling centers close and extending to January 6, when the presidential results are certified by a joint session of Congress. 'Foreign driven or amplified violent protests, violence or physical threats to election workers or state and local officials could challenge state and local officials' ability to conduct elements of the certification and Electoral College process,' the official said. 'Particularly if they prevent necessary physical access to facilities or venues.' U.S. intelligence officials have previously warned that Russia and Iran have been especially active, running a variety of influence operations targeting U.S. voters, with a high likelihood that these efforts would extend beyond the November 5 election. Russia, they said, has been working to boost the chances of former president and current Republican nominee Donald Trump, while Iran has been working to hurt Trump’s reelection bid and instead buoy the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. China, according to U.S. intelligence officials, has so far stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its efforts on congressional and state and local candidates perceived to be promoting policies detrimental to Beijing's interests, including those voicing support for Taiwan. Officials said Tuesday that new intelligence streams have raised concerns that Moscow, especially, will try to foment violence once the polls close. 'We expect Russia will be more aggressive in this period if the vice president [Kamala Harris] wins the election,' the intelligence official said. 'Russia would prefer the former president to win, and they would seek to more aggressively undermine the presidency of the then-president-elect.' Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of election meddling. Russia and Iran have yet to respond to requests from VOA for comment, but China on Tuesday again rejected the latest U.S. intelligence findings. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email. 'China has no intention and will not interfere.' U.S. intelligence officials, though, point to what they describe as growing examples of malign intent, especially by Russia and Iran. Influence operations In one example, the officials said Russian-linked actors were responsible for a post on the X social media platform earlier this month that contained false allegations against Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz. 'There are several indicators of manipulation that are consistent with the influence, efforts and tactics of Russian influence actors this cycle,' the U.S. intelligence official said. In another case, U.S. officials said a Russian intelligence unit sought to recruit what they assess to likely be an unwitting American to organize protests. They also point to actions taken last month by multiple U.S. agencies to counter several Russian influence efforts, including the use of fake websites and the creation of a shell company to funnel $10 million to a U.S. media company to push pro-Russian propaganda. Also last month, the U.S. placed bounties and lodged criminal charges against three Iranian hackers, all accused of seeking to undermine the Trump reelection campaign. And there are fears that even these types of ongoing influence operations, which often seek to exploit divisive political issues, could lead to problems. 'Even if these disinformation campaigns are not specifically calling for violence, the tactics used to undermine confidence in the democratic institutions can lead to violence, even if not deliberately called for,' said a senior official with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, who, like the U.S. intelligence official, spoke on the condition of anonymity. ‘Expect disruptions’ And while U.S. officials express confidence that safeguards are in place to prevent U.S. adversaries from attacking or hacking systems used to record and tally votes, there is concern that they will target other U.S. infrastructure to try to induce panic or violence. 'That is a real possibility,' said the CISA official, adding the U.S. public should 'expect disruptions.' 'We're going to see a voting location lose power,' the official said. 'We're going to see potentially some type of impact on a transportation system. We're going to see a potential ransomware attack against a local election office.' CISA officials say they have been working with state and local election officials to make sure they are prepared to handle sudden disruptions. And state officials say they are prepared. 'All states consider their election infrastructure and IT [information technology] systems a potential target for threats,' said Steve Simon, Minnesota’s secretary of state and the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, during a call with reporters Monday. 'Chief elections officials throughout the United States have worked really tirelessly and consistently to mitigate risks to our election systems and processes,' said Simon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-ramped-up-election-influence-efforts-aim-to-stoke-violence/7832869.html	2024-10-22T13:20:31-07:00	
Biden welcomes Slovenian leader Golob to White House	President Joe Biden on Tuesday welcomed Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob to the White House, where Biden spoke of the importance of European unity and recognized the small Central European nation’s outsized role in the largest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia in decades. Biden underscored Ljubljana’s critical role in the August swap that saw the release of 24 people, including three high-profile Americans in Russian custody: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gerskovich, Radio Free Europe reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and Paul Whelan. Slovenia held two Russian spies in prison – and their release was a critical part of the deal. 'You made it possible,' Biden said to Golob in the Oval Office. 'Thank you. We made it clear to anyone who questions whether our allies matter. Well, just look at what you did. They matter a great deal.' Biden, who spoke of his role in pushing for the nation to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization nearly two decades ago, continued his push for European unity – diplomatically and through institutions like the NATO security bloc – to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine. 'Because I knew then what I know now: We're stronger when we stand together with good partners like you,' Biden said. 'We've seen it in support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's aggression and we see it in our work to support democracy and prosperity across the western Balkans.' Golob replied by calling Biden a nickname that has become popular with European leaders. 'Dear Joe, just a couple of words,' he said, in English. 'And that is with little help of true friends, nothing is impossible. And I think that's really what our joint effort with the prisoner swap demonstrated to all of the world. And let's continue to work in true friendship and with a lot of friends.' The two also discussed a wide range of issues, the White House said, like energy security and cooperation and events in the Middle East. This meeting – the first Oval Office visit by a Slovenian leader in 18 years – is 'a particularly important legacy of Biden's administration,' said Wojciech Przybylski, editor-in-chief of Warsaw-based think tank Visegrad Insight. 'Slovenia is also a major stakeholder in the development of other Southeastern European countries of the Balkan region, where the U.S. is investing heavily to make Europe whole and free from wars and autocratic rule,' he told VOA via email. 'From a geopolitical point of view, Russian influence and even more important Chinese influence, including Beijing's ambitions to be the dominant player in the Slovenian port of Koper, a major port on the Adriatic Sea, is an important backdrop to the discussions on the economic security of Central and Eastern Europe.' Analyst Donatienne Ruy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told VOA by email that Golob’s visit is 'an important recognition of the small country’s contributions to transatlantic relations, as both a NATO and an EU member.' Slovenia, she said, is using its rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council to support Ukraine and is an 'anchor for the Western Balkans region' and it could soon play a big role in helming the European Commission’s enlargement efforts, as the top diplomat in line for the job is a left-leaning Slovene. The nation hasn’t always held liberal stances, she said. 'The country itself has seen ups and downs in governance in its post-Communist history, most recently under former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, who adopted an illiberal populist stance — he threatened the independence of the media and regularly attacked his opponents [rhetorically],' she said. 'The current government has been a more positive actor both on governance and democracy issues and as an EU member, which the White House visit likely acknowledges.'

US charges Iranian Revolutionary Guard official in plot to kill VOA host	The United States has charged a senior Iranian official and three others linked to Tehran for their role in a failed assassination plot targeting VOA host Masih Alinejad. Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ruhollah Bazghandi, a senior official in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and three other men linked to Tehran, with participating in a failed attempt to assassinate VOA Persian service journalist Alinejad in Brooklyn in 2022, according to a new indictment made public on Tuesday. These charges are the first to directly accuse a high-ranking official in the Revolutionary Guard, or IRGC, with a role in the plot to kill Iranian American Alinejad, a staunch critic of Iran's repression of women. 'Today's indictment exposes the full extent of Iran's plot to silence an American journalist for criticizing the Iranian regime,' FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. 'As these charges show, the FBI will work with our partners here and abroad to hold accountable those who target Americans.' The indictment describes Bazghandi as a brigadier general with the IRGC. The U.S. Treasury Department last year called him a counterintelligence official. Alinejad said this indictment confirms the lengths the Iranian government will go to in order to silence its critics. 'It shows that this is in the DNA of the Revolutionary Guards,' she told VOA. 'Now we have proof' When the FBI told Alinejad the news Tuesday morning, she said she felt a mix of excitement and sadness. 'I was so excited because now we have proof that this is a member of the Revolutionary Guards ordering a man in New York, from inside Iran, to kill a U.S. citizen,' she said. 'That was my reaction. Mixed feelings. Happy, but at the same time sad that the same people cannot be stopped from killing innocent women and men inside [Iran].' When the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Bazghandi, it said he had been involved with assassination plots against journalists and others considered enemies of Tehran. These aren't the first charges related to the killing scheme. The failed plot to kill Alinejad led to federal murder-for-hire charges against members of an Eastern European criminal organization with connections to Iran who were hired to carry out assassination. Surveillance, harassment, intimidation Iran is among the most prolific countries that reaches across its borders to target journalists and activists overseas in a process known as transnational repression, according to Freedom House. Common tactics include surveillance, harassment and intimidation. The failed assassination plot came one year after a failed kidnapping attempt against Alinejad in 2021. The FBI has said the kidnapping attempt was part of a Tehran plot to bring Alinejad to Iran. Since the kidnapping attempt, Alinejad has received U.S. government protection and moved frequently between safe houses. Despite the threats, Alinejad has refused to stop her work. 'I don't have any guns and bullets — I don't carry weapons. But this government, they have everything, and they're really scared of me,' Alinejad told VOA late last year, referring to the Iranian government. 'And that gives me power — that, wow, even with my words, even with my social media, I'm more powerful than them.' 'This is about protecting democracy' Iran is among the most censored countries in the world. At the end of 2023, Iran ranked among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, with 17 reporters behind bars. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. Alinejad said it's important for the U.S. government to hold Iran accountable for the plot and for Tehran's broader use of transnational repression. 'This is not a partisan issue. This is about protecting democracy. Because I don't think that they targeted me. I have no fear for my own life,' Alinejad said. 'The Iranian regime is challenging the U.S. government on U.S. soil, and basically this is targeting freedom of speech, and the national security and safety of America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-iranian-revolutionary-guard-official-in-plot-to-kill-voa-host/7832832.html	2024-10-22T12:58:10-07:00	
Ethiopia begins selling stakes in state-owned company	Ethiopia’s state-owned telecommunications company has started selling shares to the public, in a move aimed at establishing a new national stock market and giving Ethiopians a stake in the company, one of the country's largest and most profitable. Ethio Telecom will be the first company listed on the new Ethiopian Securities Exchange, or ESX, which is set to begin operating in November. It will be the country’s first stock market since the 1970s. Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said last Wednesday that the 130-year-old Ethio Telecom is offering 10% of its shares to the public, 100 million shares in all. Investors, who must be Ethiopian nationals, can buy up to 3,333 shares of the company at a price of 300 birr, or about $2.50 per share. CEO Frehiwot Tamiru said the company will now be called Ethio Telecom PLC. 'Today marks a significant milestone as we launch the sale of Ethio Telecom shares, an essential step in our ongoing journey from political revolution to evolution over the past six years,' Abiy said in a post on X. He said offering the shares lays 'the groundwork for Ethiopia’s stock market and expanding access to ownership in one of the nation’s leading state-owned enterprises, which has now evolved into a share company.' Ethiopia, once a communist country aligned with the Soviet Union, has gradually allowed greater foreign investment and has slowly privatized state companies, though the government still owns and controls key banking, telecom and transportation firms. Not everyone sees the sale of Ethio Telecom shares as a sure winner for the Ethiopian public. Ethiopian economist and the executive director of Initiative Africa, Kibur Gena, is concerned that only wealthy Ethiopians will be able to invest in the company. 'This raises questions, in my opinion, of fairness and inclusivity,' he said. 'Such a move might provide, of course, immediate financial benefits to the government; it could also perpetuate inequalities in wealth distribution and restrict, of course, broader public participation in national assets.' Kibur argues that this approach to privatization could lead to a 'deeper wealth gap' and make it harder for the majority of Ethiopians to gain access to economic opportunities.' 'This would certainly contradict the principles of economic equity, which many argue that, when you sell public assets or public resources, they should be distributed more widely to ensure that economic benefits reach marginalized or less affluent groups.' Ethio Telecom sees it differently. To help ensure that the share sale is inclusive, investors can buy as few as 33 shares, purchasable for 9,900 birr ($82), according to a company post on Facebook. However, many Ethiopians don’t even earn $82 in a month, according to World Bank data. Asked why the privatization of state companies have been slow in Ethiopia, Kibur said it can be seen as a 'pragmatic strategy to protect national development goals' and 'maintain economic sovereignty.' 'In many ways, privatization may eventually happen and it is happening,’’ he said. ‘’Many economists would argue that it should be done gradually with strong regulatory frameworks in place so that it can ensure that it contributes to long-term development and social stability rather than short-term market efficiency.' Abiy said Ethio Telecom generated about $829 million in revenue and $239 million in profit during 2023, noting the amount is the most income generated for the state, compared to all other domestic and foreign companies operating in Ethiopia, including commercial banks, combined. 'We are doing this so that people could have confidence in it and join the stock market but it would have continued to be profitable even if we didn't sell shares,' the prime minister said. Abiy hinted the government may offer more stakes for sale. 'The sale of shares that we started with Ethio Telecom may continue with Ethiopian Airlines, with hotels and other sectors,' he said.

Western nations urge transparency on rights in Xinjiang, Tibet	United Nations — A group of Western nations called on China Tuesday to release all arbitrarily detained Uyghur Muslims and Tibetans and to allow independent human rights observers to visit sites to make assessments. 'Transparency and openness are key to allaying concerns,' said Australian Ambassador to the United Nations James Larsen, during a U.N. General Assembly committee meeting on human rights. 'We call on China to allow unfettered and meaningful access to Xinjiang and Tibet for independent observers, including from the U.N., to evaluate the human rights situation.' Larsen made the statement on behalf of 15 countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. Xinjiang is the autonomous region in northwestern China where the minority Uyghur and Turkic-speaking people live. Human rights groups accuse Beijing of detaining as many as 1 million ethnic Uyghur Muslims in 'reeducation camps' in Xinjiang. It has also cracked down on freedoms in Tibet. Ambassador Larsen noted reports by several U.N. human rights experts that expressed concerns, including about large-scale arbitrary detention of individuals in Xinjiang, enforced disappearances, forced labor, and the destruction of religious and cultural sites. 'China has had many opportunities to meaningfully address the U.N.'s well-founded concerns,' Larsen said. 'Instead, China labeled the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ assessment as 'illegal and void’ during its Universal Periodic Review adoption in July.' He noted Tibetans have also been targeted by Beijing for their peaceful expression of political views, had their language, culture, educational and religious rights erode, and experienced restrictions on their travel. 'No country has a perfect human rights record, but no country is above fair scrutiny of its human rights obligations,' Larsen said. China’s envoy dismissed the accusations, accusing the Western group of 'weaponizing' human rights to provoke a confrontation. 'The so-called assessment report on Xinjiang is fraught with lies and deception,' Ambassador Fu Cong told the committee. 'It is purely the product of a coercion of OHCHR (the U.N. human rights office) by the United States and a few others.' Ambassador Fu said the committee should focus its attention on the situation in Gaza, which is a 'living hell,' and accused the Western nations of double standards when it comes to the human rights of Muslims. 'This revealed, once again, the true intentions of Australia and the U.S. to use human rights as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs and to curb its development and to broadly suppress developing countries that adhere to an independent and autonomous foreign policy,' he said. The United States and several other countries have described China’s actions in Xinjiang as genocide, a charge Beijing denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/western-nations-urge-transparency-on-rights-in-xinjiang-tibet/7832848.html	2024-10-22T12:39:16-07:00	
Polio resurfaces in Ivory Coast, threatening country’s children	Health officials say there have been six cases of polio reported in Ivory Coast in 2023, and one so far this year.

Election observers arrive in Botswana ahead of October 30 poll	Gaborone, Botswana — Observers have begun arriving in Botswana to monitor activities ahead of the Oct. 30 general election. On Tuesday, the Southern African Development Community, or SADC, officially launched its mission with a call for peaceful elections. Tanzania’s former prime minister Mizengo Pinda leads the SADC electoral observation mission, which joins other groups from the Commonwealth and the African Union. Pinda said the SADC electoral observer's mission is in line with the regional bloc’s aspiration to hold democratic elections within member states. 'When you go to observe an election, first is to get a picture of how prepared the host country is. In this case, we are sure that things have been prepared very well,' Pinda said. 'But the second thing, of course, the assurance must go beyond that general statement. We want to be sure that peace is prevailing, and that peace will prevail even during the elections.' The SADC has been criticized for failing to hold errant members to account, with the recent Zimbabwe and Mozambique polls blessed as free and fair, despite reported irregularities. SADC Executive Secretary Elias Magosi said the bloc can only make recommendations, and its reports are not binding on member states. 'In the reports that are produced by the observation missions, SADC in its nature does not have a carrot-and-stick approach when it comes to these matters,' he said. 'Ordinarily, SADC urges its member states to abide by its principles or the guidelines. And ordinarily expects member states to implement those recommendations.' However, Magosi said, if the electoral transgressions are considered serious, the matter is referred to the highest decision-making structure, the SADC summit. Heads of state from member nations convene the summit annually. 'Where matters become very serious, through the [SADC] secretariat, the chairperson of the organ is entitled by the guidelines to actually bring those issues before summit for summit to consider,' Magosi said. Only a handful of political party representatives attended Tuesday's SADC observer mission launch. The opposition has alleged there are attempts to rig the poll. Phenyo Butale of the Alliance for Progressives — which is running under the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change — said his party sent no one to the meeting, as they believe SADC election observers are compromised. 'We did not find it worthwhile to come to witness this launch because, as you know, they were in Zimbabwe, and they gave a report that said elections ran short of standards set by SADC and the elections were not free and fair,' Butale said. 'We met the advance observer team and told them that we would not find it worthwhile to engage them until we know what happened to the [Zimbabwe] report.' Botswana’s Foreign Affairs Minister Lemogang Kwape said observers will be allowed to carry out their duty unhindered. 'We open our doors, it’s a free country. Go [to] every corner of this country and observe. Interact with people and make your observations, which we believe will be independent. Botswana, as a country, stands ready to receive your comments,' Kwape said. Commonwealth and AU observers arrived in the country last week, in time to monitor the advance election for poll workers, soldiers and police, which took place Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/election-observers-arrive-in-botswana-ahead-of-october-30-poll/7832753.html	2024-10-22T11:38:21-07:00	
Kremlin moves to silence Russia war critics in Central Asia	For Lev Skoryakin, a fugitive Russian political activist on the Kremlin's wanted list for staging anti-government protests, luck ran out in June 2023. Having fled to Kyrgyzstan the previous summer, he managed to keep a low profile for more than a year before Kyrgyz authorities, acting on a Russian government request, found him in the capital, Bishkek. In October of that year, they extradited him to Russia. Skoryakin, who emigrated to Germany early this year after spending three months in a Russian prison, told VOA that Kyrgyz authorities figured out where he was by using a novel facial recognition system, which they launched in June 2023 with the help of the Russian government. 'Russian emigre dissidents [in Central Asia] should be really vigilant, and they should follow basic safety rules. … The facial recognition system is still operating in Bishkek,' Skoryakin said. The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry reported in January that the system had facilitated the arrests of more than 800 people through the end of last year, mostly common criminals, including more than 100 who were put on the international wanted list by Interpol. Since 2022, scores of Russian anti-war activists such as Skoryakin have fled political repression in Russia and found temporary refuge in the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. But after a series of arrests, abductions and extraditions, these dissidents are no longer safe in those countries. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, there was an exodus from Russia of mainly conscription-age men. According to regional media reports, approximately 400,000 Russian citizens arrived in Kazakhstan in 2022 and around 445,000 Russian citizens went to Kyrgyzstan. Critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, such as Skoryakin, saw these countries as transit points on the way to exile in the West. While he was in Kyrgyzstan, Skoryakin applied for a temporary travel document to allow him to emigrate to Germany. Kyrgyz authorities initially welcomed the Russian dissidents. Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov said in an October 2022 New York Times interview, 'We don’t see any harm; on the contrary, we see more benefits' from Russian immigrants. Moscow had a different view. Since 2022, the Kremlin has used a range of measures to force Kazakh and Kyrgyz governments to act against Russian dissidents, including arrests and the banning of public protests against Russia. Russia also relied on extradition treaties with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to silence its critics. Acting on Russia's request, between 2022 and 2024, Kazakhstan arrested at least seven Russian dissidents. Kyrgyz media reported on four arrests of anti-Kremlin activists in Kyrgyzstan, all of whom have been handed over to Russian authorities. According to Kazakh media, the extradition cases against the Russian dissidents in that country are still pending a final resolution. The Kremlin has also encouraged Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to reveal information about Russian activists. In June 2023, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement on sharing 'information on the residence status, citizenship, migration registration, visas, property, criminal records and identity documents of individuals living within their borders.' As part of the agreement, Russia reportedly provided data about 85,000 Russian citizens to the Kyrgyz authorities. According to Kyrgyz media, Kyrgyzstan used this data for its facial recognition system, which helped identify and arrest four Russian dissidents, including Skoryakin, shortly after the data-sharing agreement was signed in June 2023. Zhanar Akaev, the chair of the parliamentary committee in charge of international affairs, has said Russian security services are exerting pressure on Kyrgyzstan. 'Political immigrants from Russia should avoid coming [to Kyrgyzstan]. This is because Russian security services have strong influence. If they will ask, our security agencies will not say no. As far as I know, the FSB [Russia's Federal Security Service] works freely here,' he said. In Kyrgyzstan, Akaev is part of a handful of Kyrgyz political activists who are publicly critical of the Kyrgyz government. International human rights watchdogs indicate that Kyrgyz authorities have become increasingly intolerant of political dissent and have silenced most government critics. A Kyrgyzstani human rights activist, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for fear of official retribution, said that 'criticizing the treatment of Russian dissidents' can land human rights defenders in trouble with the Kyrgyz government. 'In return for getting the Russian [dissidents],' the activist said, 'Moscow handed over Kyrgyz activists in Russia who were critical of the Kyrgyz government.' The Russian government action against Russian dissidents in Central Asia has paid off. As of early 2024, Rapid Response Unit, a nonprofit organization that assisted hundreds of Russian dissidents to flee from Russia, stopped sending people to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In an August 2023 interview with Kazakh journalists, Evgenii Zhovtis, a Kazakhstani human rights defender, said that most of the arrested Russian activists were in legal limbo in Kazakhstan. 'There are no legal grounds to prosecute them, but letting them out of the country is also difficult. Their identification documents are about to expire. To obtain new documents, they need to go to the [Russian] consulate,' Zhovtis said. With anti-Kremlin activists in Central Asia silenced, the Russian government is shifting its focus to unfriendly Central Asian nongovernmental organizations. Addressing a Russian government meeting in February, former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said, 'Against the backdrop of the special military operation [against Ukraine], these NGOs significantly increased their anti-Russian activities in order to reduce military-technical, economic and cultural cooperation between the Central Asian states and the Russian Federation.' He added that that Russia needs to take 'special preventive measures' against such NGOs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-moves-to-silence-russian-war-critics-in-central-asia/7832720.html	2024-10-22T11:35:18-07:00	
11 killed in Uganda tanker truck explosion, police say	kampala, uganda — At least 11 people were killed Tuesday after a fuel truck exploded next to a highway in Uganda, police said. The truck overturned after an accident and later exploded in a town just outside Kampala, the capital, police spokesman Patrick Onyango said. A cloud of dark smoke rose from the scene. A video shared online by an onlooker appeared to show people scooping up fuel from the truck before the blast. The dangerous scene echoed a similar incident in Nigeria last week that killed more than 140 people, including children. People who rush to collect fuel from stricken trucks hope to sell it, despite warnings to stay away. There have been similar incidents over the years across East Africa. At least 62 people were killed in Tanzania in 2019 as they attempted to siphon fuel out of a damaged truck. In South Sudan, at least 183 people were killed in 2015 when hundreds of villagers gathered around a fuel truck to collect fuel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-uganda-tanker-truck-explosion-police-say/7832736.html	2024-10-22T11:22:22-07:00	
UN: Gaza's looming development crisis imperils future generations	GENEVA — A new United Nations report warns that the catastrophic humanitarian impact of the war in Gaza has set back development in the Palestinian enclave by seven decades and will imperil Palestinians for generations — and not only in Gaza. 'Projections in this new assessment confirm that amid the immediate suffering and horrific loss of life, a serious development crisis is also unfolding — one that jeopardizes the future of Palestinians for generations to come,' said United Nations Development Program, or UNDP, administrator Achim Steiner. In a statement coinciding with Tuesday’s launch of the UNDP report, produced in coordination with the U.N.’s Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Steiner observed that 'even if humanitarian aid is provided each year, the economy may not regain its precrisis level for a decade or more.' The new assessment is replete with shocking statistics. It estimates that poverty in the Gaza Strip and Israeli-occupied West Bank will rise to 74.3% in 2024, up from 38.8% at the end of 2023, 'affecting 4.1 million people, including 2.61 million people who are newly impoverished.' Because of 'staggering' economic losses, the gross domestic product is projected to contract by 35.1% this year, with unemployment potentially rising to 49.9%. 'Unemployment is skyrocketing, and one in two people is jobless,' said Chitose Noguchi, deputy special representative for UNDP’s assistance program for Palestinians. 'In Gaza, unemployment is reaching 80%,' Noguchi told reporters in Geneva via feed from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. 'Poverty is exponentially rising. Three in four people live in poverty.' The Palestinian territories are 'experiencing an unprecedented setback in development as measured by the Human Development Index, or HDI, indicating a loss of almost 24 years of development gains,' she said, describing the territories as the 'State of Palestine.' Dozens of countries recognize a Palestinian state, but the United States and most Western European countries do not. Underscoring this grim assessment, authors of the report say that the HDI in the Palestine territories may fall to 0.643, 'a level not seen since HDI calculations began in 2004.' Authors of the report expect Gaza’s HDI to drop to 0.408, 'erasing over 20 years of progress.' They said the HDI of the West Bank is expected to decline to 0.676, 'reflecting a loss of 16 years of development.' The assessment presents three possible scenarios for early recovery. The first two consider 'Restricted Early Recovery' or 'No Early Recovery' at all. 'Under these two scenarios, the current strict ban imposed on Palestinian workers persists as well as the withholding of ‘clearance revenues’ to the Palestinian Authority.' 'The only difference between these scenarios is the level of humanitarian aid allocated to address immediate needs,' the report said. 'With no early recovery at all, the assessment assumes aid would remain unchanged from current levels,' an amount of around $280 million annually. 'Even if it flowed at the rate of $280 million every year for 10 years,' said Noguchi, 'simulations in this assessment show that humanitarian aid alone cannot put the Palestinian economy on a restorative track to restore prewar levels and align with Palestinian development goals.' She said investments allowing recovery efforts to go ahead are crucial, adding that 'recovery must be enabled to eventually support reconstruction of destroyed capital and restoration of lost livelihoods.' 'Restrictions that are currently stifling the economy must be lifted,' said Noguchi, adding that this would improve the business climate, 'allowing the private sector to contribute to recovery and reconstruction.' Authors of the report agree that putting Gaza back together will be a very costly matter, given the number of casualties estimated by Gaza’s Health Ministry — nearly 43,000 killed and some 100,000 injured — and the widespread destruction of essential infrastructure and collapse of regional health care and economic systems. Israel launched the war with a declared goal of freeing Israeli hostages and ending Hamas’ control of Gaza after the group staged a terror attack on Israel that claimed some 1,200 lives. A report issued by the World Bank in April estimated the cost of damage to critical infrastructure in Gaza to be around $18.5 billion. 'Our assessments serve to sound the alarm over the millions of lives that are being shattered and the decades of development efforts that are being wiped out,' said Rola Dashti, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. 'It is high time to end the suffering and bloodshed that engulfed our region,' she said. 'We must unite to find a lasting solution where all peoples can live in peace, dignity, and reap the benefit of sustainable development.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-gaza-looming-development-crisis-imperils-future-generations/7832635.html	2024-10-22T10:38:47-07:00	
Xi, Putin embrace growing cooperation between Russia and China at BRICS summit	Russian President Vladimir Putin called Chinese President Xi Jinping his 'dear friend,' amid growing cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, as the leaders met at the BRICS summit in Kazan. Xi also expressed his gratitude at the meeting regarding the increasing partnership between Russia and China, saying the 'profound relationship' between the two countries has 'continuously deepened and expanded comprehensive strategic coordination and practical cooperation.' Since Russia launched its military offensive in Ukraine in 2022, China has been a key partner providing military assistance to Moscow in the forms of dual use components and technology and tools that could be used for military machines. Shortly before Russia’s military offensive, China declared a 'no limits' partnership with Russia when Putin visited Beijing. Xi said Beijing’s cooperation with Moscow is a stabilizing factor for the world. 'The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined,' Xi told Putin, adding that ties between the countries have 'injected strong impetus into the development, revitalization and modernization of the two countries' and 'made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice.' Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the BRICS meeting in Kazan is the countries’ 'largest foreign policy event ever held,' as Russia is hosting 36 countries and 20 heads of state. The Kremlin sees the meeting as an opportunity for a rallying point to defy Western influences in global affairs. The BRICS alliance refers to a grouping of emerging economies whose core members are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, but has been expanding rapidly to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. In addition, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, while other countries have expressed their interest in joining the alliance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-putin-embrace-growing-cooperation-between-russia-and-china-at-brics-summit/7832643.html	2024-10-22T10:07:55-07:00	
Palau divided over government proposal to ease restrictions on fishing	Koror, Palau — When Palau passed a law to close off 80% of its oceans to fishing in 2015, the tiny pacific nation became a global leader in conservation. Palau’s national marine sanctuary is one of the largest in the world. But now, that legacy is being tested with a government proposed plan to expand fishing in the waters from 20% to 50%, effectively shrinking the size of the national marine sanctuary by 30%. The debate over the plan is one key issue dividing voters in this year’s general elections, which take place next month on November 5. The two presidential candidates in the election, current president Surangel Whipps Jr. and former president Tommy Remengesau Jr., who happen to be brothers-in-laws, hold opposing views over the future of the marine sanctuary. Whipps Jr. believes Palau should try to strike a balance between ocean conservation and sustainable use of its marine resources, while Remengesau Jr. wants to see Palau remain a leader when it comes to ocean conservation. The government’s proposed plan, officially titled Marine Spatial Planning, aims to continue Palau’s efforts to protect biodiversity in its territorial waters while trying to grow the Pacific Island country’s domestic fishing industry. The island’s fishing industry is small due to a lack of resources and fierce competition from foreign fishing vessels. 'We are trying to figure out how to protect and manage a healthy ocean while developing sustainable use of its resources,' Steven Victor, Palau’s Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment, told VOA in an interview from his office in Palau that faces the ocean and is near a popular fishing spot. 'If we are able to demonstrate that we can do it in Palau, it will have a wide-ranging impact on ocean conservation throughout the Pacific,' he added. Victor said a drop in tuna supply in Palau and the country’s growing reliance on imported seafood is one of the key drivers behind the plan. 'We’ve seen an increase in seafood imports since 2020 because of the drop in local tuna supply and this has made fish unaffordable to the most vulnerable members in Palau,' he told VOA. Rising tuna prices The ban on any form of fishing in 80% of Palau’s Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ, has led to an increased catching and consumption of reef fish in Palau, which are species the sanctuary was meant to protect. 'When tuna at the local market in Palau is more expensive than reef fish, it leads to more consumption of reef fish, and it could affect tourism in the country since tourists come to Palau to see the reef fish,' Palau’s president Surangel Whipps Jr. told VOA in an interview at his office in Palau. 'As a leader in conservation, Palau should show how we can balance protection and production and it starts with using good science and doing a marine spatial plan,' he added. While the Palauan government vows to balance conservation and sustainable exploration of the country’s marine resources through the proposed plan, some activists and politicians worry the proposal could damage Palau’s reputation as a leader in ocean conservation. 'Our reputation will be out of the door and there will be no more ‘pristine paradise Palau. This is a brand equity question I’ve brought up repeatedly,' said Jennifer Koskelin-Gibbons, co-founder of the Palau Legacy Project, an NGO that focuses on environmental protection and ocean conservation in Palau. Others say the government’s attempt to expand the fishing zone in the marine sanctuary could cause Palau to lose valuable foreign funding for its conservation efforts. 'There is still the potential of getting funding through carbon credits, science, and efforts to address climate change so why are we lessening our contribution to the world,' Tommy Remengesau Jr., Palau’s former president who signed the marine sanctuary into law in 2015, told VOA in an interview at his home in Palau. In response, Whipps Jr. said through the proposed plan, Palau is trying to do more than some scientific studies have suggested to ensure the biodiversity in its ocean remains protected. 'National Geographic released a report in May recommending that Palau should impose a 50-mile ban around all the reefs, which equates to a little less than 30 percent of our EEZ, to ensure biodiversity continues, and we say we’ll take a baby step by adjusting the marine sanctuary to 50% of Palau’s EEZ,' he told VOA. Foreign fishing fleets Some Palauan fishermen worry that the increased area for commercial fishing would allow big foreign fishing fleets to return to Palau and re-establish dominance over the fishing sector. 'Palau used to only get four percent out of 100 dollars through the license fee when foreign companies were allowed to fish in Palauan waters in the past, and I worry the government’s proposed plan would eventually bring back these foreign fishing companies, who will take all the fish away from Palauans,' Okada Techitong, the chairperson of Belau Offshore Fishers Inc, one of the two main local fishing companies in Palau, told VOA at his office. Victor, Palau’s fisheries minister said the government plans to only allow fishing companies that have fished in Palauan waters since January 2020, which was when the marine sanctuary came into effect, to fish in the expanded fishing zone. This means only two domestic fishing companies, Belau Offishore Fishers Inc. and Palau Commercial Fishing Company, as well as the Japanese fishing fleets helping to support Palau’s fishing industry, would be allowed to fish under the government’s proposed plan for the next five years. 'This could keep foreign fishing companies from coming in and re-establishing themselves in Palau and we feel that five years would be enough time for Palauan fishing companies to grow financially,' Victor told VOA. However, some Palauan fishermen still think Palau should keep the marine sanctuary at the same size since the 20% fishing zone is already enough for the Palauan fishermen. 'Fishing is not an industry that a lot of Palauans are interested in joining, so I don’t think it’ll be easy for Palau to grow its own fishing industry,' Richard Rechirei, a Palauan fisherman told VOA at a ship repair shop in Palau. As Palau’s senate reviews the government’s proposal, Victor said there is some opposition to the proposed plan in the senate. And with some environmental activists seeking election, the changes to the marine sanctuary could face some challenges after next month’s vote. In order for all sides to reach a consensus on this 'divisive issue,' Victor said trust needs to be established between the local community and the government in order for the plan to serve its purpose. 'If there’s no trust, this thing can’t work. The government hopes to provide relevant information so people can make informed decisions about how Palau should address this issue,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palau-divided-over-government-proposal-to-ease-restrictions-on-fishing/7832434.html	2024-10-22T08:40:47-07:00	
Bilingual school in Hungary helps Ukrainian children preserve identity	The United Nations says the war in Ukraine has displaced more than 6 million people and forced many of them to register as refugees across Europe.

Freedom House researcher explains how free freedom is on the net	Washington — Global internet freedom has declined for the 14th straight year, according to Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net 2024 report. VOA’s Philip Alexiou spoke with Elizabeth Sutterlin, a researcher at the advocacy group, on October 21. Sutterlin outlined the various tactics used to crack down on online publishing, including imprisonment and violence. The interview centers on how these issues impact Africa. It has been edited for brevity and clarity. Elizabeth Sutterlin: This continuing decline in global Internet freedom is largely driven by a worldwide assault on freedom of expression. We saw people face arrest for expressing themselves online in three-quarters of the countries that we cover in the project. And this year, we also saw a record high in people facing physical violence in retaliation for their online activity. VOA’s Philip Alexiou: Does this sort of thing happen more during election season, or is it always ongoing? Sutterlin: I think this is always an ongoing issue. But this year, our report really honed in on the rapid series of elections taking place around the world, including in Africa, in places like South Africa and Zimbabwe. And we really observed that these elections have been deepening this crisis. False and misleading claims have sought to undermine the integrity of elections themselves. And there have been efforts to de-legitimize independent fact checkers who are doing essential work to make sure that people who are voting have reliable information to make informed choices about their future. VOA: What are these countries doing? You look at Zimbabwe, like you mentioned, South Africa. I know you studied a number of other countries in Africa. What are some of the tactics being used and how are people being targeted? Sutterlin: We’ve seen really a range of tactics deployed to restrict people’s access to information online. Arrests and imprisonment is a really common one in all but one of the countries that we cover in Africa during this year. We saw people arrested or imprisoned for their online expression. One example of this, last October in Angola, an influencer was sentenced to two years in jail and handed a hefty fine for insulting the president in a TikTok video. But increasingly, during the project, we’ve seen an uptick in the manipulation of the online information space through the use of pro-government commentators and others pushing online narratives. Zimbabwe’s a prominent example of this, as during their elections last August, state media really amplified narratives that discredited both domestic civil society election observers and international groups who reported on the conduct of the elections. VOA: But there’s also been some improvement by some countries and Zambia, in Africa at least, was one of them. And when you look at that country or some other countries, what are they doing to actually make things better in cutting down on censorship and control? Sutterlin: Zambia, as you said, saw one of the region’s largest improvements; actually the largest improvement globally this year. And this was really driven by space opening up for online activism. So, although there’s certainly a lot further to go, we continue to see some concerning arrests of people for insulting the president and for other concerning issues. Zambian civil society has really led the way in pushing back against repressive measures. They’ve advocated for the reform of problematic cybercrime laws and took the regulator to court recently after instituting new requirements to collect facial photos and SIM card registration. Civil society’s advocacy and mobilization online has really been a driver of these improvements. VOA: And when it comes to generative AI, I know we spoke with Freedom House earlier, and the idea was that, at least in the United States, it really wasn’t a problem, even though people used it, it didn’t have much of an influence or much of an effect on people. But is that the case in other countries who try to use generative AI? Sutterlin: It's a really important question. In our research this year, we did see generative AI being used frequently to create false or misleading content around elections in particular. We had an example, examples, in South Africa of deepfake videos of celebrities endorsing particular political parties. But one really important caveat in talking about generative AI and its impact on elections is that we just don’t yet understand the technologies’ impact and whether it is making influence operations more persuasive. There’s still a major research gap in this area in how we can assess and study the effectiveness and social impact of these campaigns. VOA: Is there any one group that tends to be in danger more than the other, or not? Sutterlin: Yeah, I mean, I think journalists and activists and human rights defenders just doing their work, holding powerful people to account, can definitely put them at risk. But more and more, as countries are continuing to tighten controls on and restrict freedom of expression, we’re seeing this impact on ordinary users. In one example from this year, a teacher in Kenya who made a post in a Facebook group about just the quality of roads in his county was later abducted and beaten. And just really goes to show the brutal consequences that can come from these global trends and that really anyone is at risk.

FBI probing release of US intel on Israel's attack plans for Iran	WASHINGTON — The FBI is investigating the public disclosure of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel's preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the bureau said on Tuesday. 'The FBI is investigating the alleged leak of classified documents and working closely with our partners in the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community,' it said in a statement. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday that it has not been determined whether the disclosure was a hack or a leak. President Joe Biden was watching the results of the investigation closely, he added. 'We're not exactly sure how these documents found their way into the public domain,' Kirby told reporters. 'The president remains deeply concerned about any leakage of classified information into the public domain. That is not supposed to happen, and it's unacceptable when it does,' he said. The documents appear to have been prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, describing U.S. interpretations of Israeli Air Force and Navy planning based on satellite imagery from Oct. 15-16. They began circulating last week on the Telegram messaging app. Israel has been planning a response to a ballistic-missile barrage carried out by Iran on Oct. 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. Israel has intensified its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, days after the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said an investigation was under way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-probing-release-of-us-intel-on-israel-attack-plans-for-iran/7832472.html	2024-10-22T08:14:55-07:00	
Former Abercrombie & Fitch chief arrested on sex trafficking charges	NEW YORK — Former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Michael Jeffries and two other men have been arrested on sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges, a spokesperson for federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Details of the criminal charges weren't immediately available. They come after years of sexual misconduct allegations, made in civil lawsuits and the media, from young people who said Jeffries lured them with promises of modeling work and then pressed them into sex acts. A message seeking comment was left for Brian Bieber, an attorney who has represented Jeffries. Information on attorneys for the other defendants wasn't immediately available. Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace and FBI and police officials were set to hold a news conference later Monday. Jeffries left New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie & Fitch in 2014. One civil lawsuit filed in New York last year accused Abercrombie of allowing Jeffries to run a sex-trafficking organization during his 22-year tenure. It said that Jeffries had modeling scouts scouring the internet for victims, and that some prospective models became sex-trafficking victims. Abercrombie last year said it had hired an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation after a report on similar allegations was aired by the BBC. The BBC investigation included a dozen men who described being at events involving sex acts they said were staged by Jeffries and his partner, Matthew Smith, often at his home in New York and hotels in London, Paris and elsewhere. When the civil lawsuit was filed in New York last year, Bieber declined to comment on the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-abercrombie-fitch-chief-arrested-on-sex-trafficking-charges/7832411.html	2024-10-22T07:49:35-07:00	
Spain sees opportunity in African migrant influx, bucking EU trend	Jerez de la Frontera and London — As many European Union countries call for the bloc to clamp down on migration amid a surge in support for right-wing political parties, Spain is bucking the trend and insists Europe’s aging population needs controlled migration to boost its economy. The Spanish government said there is a need for young workers amid what it called a ‘demographic winter’ on the continent, and said the EU must take this into account as it forges new migration and asylum rules which aim to relieve the ongoing pressures on its external borders. Canary Islands More than 42,000 irregular migrants have arrived in Spain so far this year according to government figures, a two-thirds increase from 2023. Most arrive on Spain’s Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, which lie more than 100 kilometers from the African coastline. It is one of the deadliest routes to Europe. Last year alone, around 6,000 migrants died attempting the crossing, according to human rights groups. For many, the dangers are outweighed by the dream of a new life in Europe. ‘Double effort’ In a small classroom in the Andalusian city of Jerez de la Frontera, a group of migrants is taking lessons in basic Spanish. 'If you make it here, the only thing you have to do is go to class, to keep learning, to talk to people. You have to be an open person, especially as an immigrant. You have to make a double effort, and that’s what we’re doing now,' said 22-year-old Malian national Macire Konare, who arrived in the Canary Islands earlier this year before being transferred to the Spanish mainland. For the migrants, there is hope of a better life. The Spanish government also sees economic potential. Aging population Like many Western countries, Spain’s population is aging fast. It desperately needs young workers to build the economy and pay the taxes that fund its state pensions and healthcare. However, the country’s birth rate last year hit its lowest level ever recorded at under 1.2, among the lowest in Europe. Speaking at a European Union leaders’ summit last Thursday, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said immigration is vital for the continent. 'Our present and future competitiveness, the economic growth of our country, the sustainability of our welfare model also depend on migration. And our credibility before the rest of the world depends also on how we deal with migration policy,' Sanchez said. 'We must manage migration flows from that perspective, that of the demographic challenge, that of how to respond to the demographic winter that Europe is suffering. And I believe we have valuable tools such as the migration and asylum pact,' he added. Migration pact The EU’s new 10-point migration and asylum pact is due to come into force in the summer of 2026 – although Spain is calling for the agreement to be implemented earlier. However, the details are yet to be finalized. Immigration remains one of the most controversial issues in European politics. Right-wing, anti-immigration parties have won recent European, national or state elections in Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia, France, Italy, Sweden and Hungary since 2022. There is growing pressure on the EU to enact tougher migration controls. Morocco accusations Spain’s far-right Vox party has also made inroads among voters frustrated with high immigration. Juan Sergio Redondo is the leader of the Vox party in Ceuta, one of two Spanish enclaves on the northern African coastline, along with Melilla, captured in the 15th and 16th centuries and which now form the only direct land borders between Europe and Africa. In May 2021, around 8,000 migrants breached the Ceuta border fence in the space of three days. The frontiers continue to come under daily pressure from migrants seeking to enter Spanish and EU territory. 'Morocco uses immigrants with the idea of blackmailing Spain and the European Union,' Redondo told VOA. 'That is to say, Morocco does not comply with the obligations under its agreements with the European Union for controlling migration… if it wants to obtain some economic or political benefit, it opens the doors and looks the other way.' Morocco denies using migration to blackmail Europe and lays its own territorial claim over Ceuta and Melilla. But it’s not only the far right accusing Morocco of exploiting immigration issues. 'The government of Morocco is using migration as a tool to obtain political goals from Spain and from Europe. And the real problem is that the Moroccan government is achieving their goals through permanent blackmail,' said Jesus Verdu Baeza, an associate professor of public international law at the University of Cadiz. Migration balance At the same time, Spain recognizes that Europe would not survive without migration, Baeza said. 'We are a country with strong values, and we want this balance between controlling migration and offering asylum-seekers a legal way to enter and to respect their rights. We need them. Here in Spain, without migrants, we have no fruits in the supermarket. Possibly, the economy simply could not function properly,' he told VOA. As part of its new approach, Spain is drafting a 'Strategy for Africa' to deliver what it describes as the economic and social transformation of the continent, 'with a focus on young people.' 'Spain is increasingly aware that Africa's present and future, its prosperity, as well as its security and progress towards truly inclusive and sustainable development, are strategic interests of the highest order for our nation. The desire for a closer partnership with Africa also reflects deep-rooted values among the Spanish people. Therefore, the new strategy cements the African continent as a priority, with a greater focus on West Africa and the Sahel,' according to an August press release from the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. EU patrols While seeking to facilitate legal migration, Spain is trying to stop irregular migrants arriving on its shores. Madrid wants the EU’s border agency Frontex to seek permission to patrol African coastlines to intercept the migrant boats. During a tour visit to west Africa in August, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signed agreements with Mauritania and Gambia to tackle people smuggling. 'It is also essential that people who have arrived illegally in Spain return to their own countries. Mainly because such a return sends a clear and strong message of deterrence to the mafias and those who put themselves in their hands,' Sanchez said at a press conference in Senegal on August 28. Migrant warning Spain is seeking a long-term solution to migration that works for Africa and for Europe – and an end to the deadly journeys across the Atlantic. Twenty-one-year-old Ahmed Qarrab, who traveled to the Canary Islands from Morocco, offered a message to others considering the same journey. 'I spent three days at sea. The truth is that it was terrible. I want to give some advice to my countrymen and friends: do not come by boat, because it is very dangerous. If you want to come here, you have to find a legal way,' he told VOA.

Putin hosts BRICS summit meant to counterbalance Western clout	KAZAN, Russia — China's Xi Jinping, India's Narendra Modi and other world leaders arrived Tuesday in the Russian city of Kazan for a summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies that the Kremlin hopes to turn into a rallying point for defying Western influence in global affairs. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of U.S.-led efforts to isolate Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as 'the largest foreign policy event ever held' by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state. The alliance that initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed interest in joining. Observers see the BRICS summit as part of the Kremlin's efforts to showcase support from the Global South amid spiraling tensions with the West and help expand economic and financial ties. Proposed projects include the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Putin, who will hold about 20 bilateral meetings on the summit sidelines, met with Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and was scheduled to confer with Xi later in the day. The summit underlined the close relationship between Xi and Putin, who announced a 'no-limits' partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. They already have met at least twice this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July. Russia's cooperation with India has also flourished as New Delhi considers Moscow a time-tested partner since Cold War times despite Russia's close ties with India's main rival, China. Western allies want India to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, but Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement. 'We believe that problems should be resolved peacefully, and we fully support the quickest establishment of peace and stability,' said Modi, who last visited Russia in July. Putin hailed what he described as a 'privileged strategic partnership' between Russia and India. During a meeting with Ramaphosa, the Russian president emphasized their shared striving for a 'fair, multi-polar global order' and specifically mentioned efforts by BRICS members to create a 'new independent payment system.' On Thursday, Putin is also set to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who will be making his first visit to Russia in more than two years. Guterres has repeatedly criticized Russia's actions in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-hosts-brics-summit-meant-to-counterbalance-western-clout/7832369.html	2024-10-22T07:41:34-07:00	
South Korea threatens to send arms, personnel to Ukraine	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea is renewing its threat to send weapons to Ukraine, days after releasing intelligence alleging that North Korea plans to deploy a large number of troops to support Russia’s invasion. South Korea will consider sending Ukraine 'weapons for defense and attack,' according to the Yonhap news agency, which cited an unnamed senior presidential official on Tuesday. Yonhap also reported Seoul may send military and intelligence personnel to Ukraine to analyze North Korean battlefield tactics and assist in interrogations of captured North Koreans. In a statement, South Korea’s National Security Council called for the 'immediate withdrawal' of North Korean troops from Russia and pledged unspecified 'phased countermeasures.' The warning marks one of Seoul's strongest yet, as concerns rise over North Korea's deepening involvement in the Ukraine conflict. Last week, South Korea’s intelligence agency said North Korea already has sent about 1,500 special forces to Russia to join the war in Ukraine, and it is planning to deploy a total of 12,000 troops from an elite unit. U.S. and NATO officials have said they cannot confirm the North Korean troop deployment but have condemned North Korea-Russia military cooperation, including Pyongyang's supply of artillery and missiles for use in Ukraine. Western countries have long urged South Korea, one of the world’s biggest weapons exporters, to directly arm Ukraine. South Korea has resisted, fearing this could prompt Russia to expand military ties with North Korea, which seeks advanced weapons targeting Seoul. Strategic shifts However, some analysts believe South Korea’s strategic calculations may be changing, since North Korea-Russia ties are growing despite Seoul’s caution. Earlier this year, North Korea and Russia restored a Cold War-era mutual defense treaty, opening the door for a much wider range of military cooperation. By sending troops to Ukraine, North Korea’s military could gain valuable battlefield experience, secure financial support to bolster the country’s struggling economy and lay the groundwork for future joint drills with Russia, according to analysts. There are also fears in Seoul that Pyongyang seeks advanced military technology from Moscow, potentially including help with its nuclear, missile or satellite programs. These concerns likely explain South Korea’s strong response to North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine, said Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. 'To me the easiest explanation is that South Korea thinks North Korea is getting something sufficiently valuable for that troop deployment, so that it makes sense to take some risk to impose costs on Russia,' Richey said. South Korea’s calculations A decision to arm Ukraine also could play into South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s foreign policy mantra of 'peace through strength,' said Ben Engel, who teaches political science and international relations at Dankook University outside Seoul. 'They won't look very strong if they don't react somehow. And sending weapons to Ukraine is something they are de facto doing already,' Engel said. 'So, doing it explicitly seems like an easy step to show strength.' South Korea has so far provided weapons only to third parties such as the United States and Poland, which are directly supplying weapons to Ukraine. Officials often defend this stance by citing domestic laws that restrict the export of arms to active conflict zones, although Yoon also has hinted that these barriers could be bypassed. One way Yoon could get around such restrictions would be to use a legal loophole meant to allow the provision of aid to developing countries, according to South Korean lawmaker Kim Joon-hyung. Kim, who opposes South Korean involvement in the Ukraine war, said he soon plans to introduce legislation that would restrict such a move. Some public opinion polls suggested that most South Koreans oppose arming Ukraine, although the subject has not been a matter of intense public debate. Some analysts suggest South Korea may also be weighing the outcome of the upcoming U.S. election before making any decisive moves — especially since former President Donald Trump has suggested he would reduce support for Ukraine. 'There's little sense in responding positively to appeals that [U.S. President Joe] Biden and NATO made six months ago if Trump wins,' said Jeffrey Robertson, a professor of diplomatic studies at Seoul’s Yonsei University. Long-term shift Beyond political considerations such as the U.S. election, some experts warn that the deepening strategic alignment between North Korea and Russia presents long-term challenges that threaten South Korea’s security. Hyun Seung-soo, a researcher specializing in Russia at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said that the relationship between North Korea and Russia is evolving beyond short-term military cooperation. 'People tend to think that North Korea will just send a few soldiers, receive economic support and get minor military technologies in return. But Kim Jong Un’s perspective is much broader than that,' Hyun said. 'For North Korea, fighting in Russia is not just about helping Russia — it’s seen as participating in North Korea’s own sacred war against the U.S.,' he said. 'Their mindset could be that they live, fight and die together with Russia.' This broader realignment could have serious implications for South Korea, Hyun warned. 'Although the number of troops being deployed might be small, the implications of such deployment are significant,' Hyun said. 'It’s an action by Russia and North Korea that could change the global political landscape.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-threatens-to-send-arms-personnel-to-ukraine/7832347.html	2024-10-22T07:30:03-07:00

New US campus protest rules spur outcry from college faculty	Dissent is thriving this fall at American colleges, and not just among student activists. With student protests limited by new restrictions, faculty have taken up the cause. To faculty, new protest rules threaten freedom of speech — and the freedom to think, both central to university life. This semester, some of the most visible demonstrations have involved professors speaking up for the right to protest itself. Last spring, pro-Palestinian tent encampments crowded schools and disrupted commencement plans, drawing accusations of antisemitism and prompting new limits. At Indiana University, an 'expressive activity policy' rolled out in August prohibits protests after 11 p.m., bans camping on campus, and requires pre-approval for signs. In defiance, each Sunday a group of faculty members, students and community members gather on campus for candlelight vigils that extend past the 11 p.m. deadline. Russ Skiba, a professor emeritus who has attended the vigils, said the new restrictions are part of a larger movement to limit academic freedom on campuses. In Indiana, the Republican governor in March signed a law increasing state oversight of public universities. The law, sponsored by a lawmaker who said colleges suffer from 'monolithic thinking,' subjects faculty to post-tenure reviews over whether they are fostering diversity of thought and keeping their political views out of the classroom. Skiba and other Indiana professors widely opposed the bill, which they criticized as vague and subject to interpretation. 'Universities are bastions of free speech, but when you have a movement that is anti-democratic, one of the places that is most attacked is freedom of speech,' Skiba said. Faculty members at colleges elsewhere around the country have pushed back on the new rules with protests, vigils and demands for explanation. A group of Harvard University professors held a 'study-in' at a campus library on Oct. 16 in support of pro-Palestinian students who were temporarily banned from the library for holding a similar demonstration. In September, a group representing University of California faculty filed a complaint alleging the system sought to chill their academic freedom and keep from teaching about the Israel-Hamas war 'in a way that does not align with the University’s own position.' To some professors, the protest restrictions are also a labor issue. Colleges have been granting tenure to fewer professors, and facing pressure in some areas to do away with it altogether. Legislatures in several states have taken an interest in how topics around race, gender and history are taught. Protest guidelines handed down by administrators are another way the faculty's say in university affairs is being diminished, some professors say. 'We have to, as faculty, organize and demand the sort of shared governance that gives us a right to review and challenge these policies,' said Todd Wolfson, a journalism and media studies professor at Rutgers University and the president of the American Association of University Professors. 'They’re not made by people coming out of the academic arm of our institutions.' Tensions on campuses nationwide have been high since the war began over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Israel’s offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Colleges have been under tremendous pressure, including from Republicans in Congress, to protect students from discrimination while upholding free speech. Demonstrations last spring blocked foot traffic in parts of some campuses and included instances of antisemitic imagery and rhetoric. Some Jewish faculty members and students have said the protests made them feel unsafe. In a message announcing new guidelines at the start of the semester, Northwestern University President Michael Schill said it needs to make sure everyone on campus feels safe and supported. 'Activities that lead to intimidation and impede an environment where dialogue and education can flourish cannot occur again,' he said. Shirin Vossoughi, a Northwestern professor, was among 52 faculty members who signed an open letter opposing the school's new demonstration policy as caving to political pressure to silence certain types of activism. She said the rules crack down not just on free speech, but pro-Palestinian voices in particular. During the protests last spring, some faculty members joined ranks with demonstrators. Others acted as mediators for students they see as under their care and protection. Faculty voted no confidence against leaders of schools including Columbia University, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis University, and Cal Poly Humboldt over their handling of the protests. At Northwestern University, Steven Thrasher was among three faculty members charged by university police for obstructing law enforcement during last spring's protests. He was suspended and removed from teaching this fall while under investigation by the university. 'The way that I saw my role was as a protector of the students' safety and of their ability to express themselves,' Thrasher said this fall. 'I knew as soon as I started seeing violence happening towards students that I would do what I could.' While schools say the rules are meant to limit disruptions, faculty members say they have the effect of neutralizing dissent. 'The whole point of a protest is to be seen and heard,' said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia University, where new rules require advance notice and prevent demonstrations that 'substantially inhibit the primary purposes' of an area of campus. 'Free speech rights aren’t served if you can only speak into the void and not have anybody hear you, and that includes the right to be seen and heard by people who don’t like what you have to say.' Professors also drew a connection to the growing percentage of lecturers, adjuncts and professors who do not have tenure protections. Professors increasingly see the issue of speech and academic freedom as a labor issue as a result of the crackdowns, said Risa Lieberwitz, AAUP's general counsel. 'We’re seeing unionization growing and increasing,' she said. 'I think to some extent it’s because it’s so important to organize, to claim democratic rights.' Wolfson said professors must stand up for students’ rights to demonstrate and speak freely. 'Their freedom of speech rights are the lifeblood of the university,' Wolfson said. 'We cannot have a university based on critical thinking and exploring questions if we’re going to clamp down on students’ rights to protest something they think is a massive problem, and if they see a way for the university to actually engage in it productively.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-us-campus-protest-rules-spur-outcry-from-college-faculty/7832335.html	2024-10-22T06:47:29-07:00	
IMF's economic view: A brighter outlook for US but still-tepid global growth	Washington — The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday upgraded its economic outlook for the United States this year, while lowering its expectations for growth in Europe and China. It left its forecast for global growth unchanged at a relatively lackluster 3.2% for 2024. The IMF expects the U.S. economy — the world's largest — to expand 2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains in inflation-adjusted wages. Next year, though, the IMF expects the U.S. economy to decelerate to 2.2% growth. With a new presidential administration and Congress in place, the IMF envisions the nation's job market losing some momentum in 2025 as the government begins seeking to curb huge budget deficits by slowing spending, raising taxes or some combination of both. The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. In its latest forecast, it expects China's economic growth to slow from 5.2% last year to 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025. The world's No. 2 economy has been hobbled by a collapse in its housing market and by weak consumer confidence — problems only partly offset by strong exports. The 20 European countries that share the euro currency are collectively expected to eke out 0.8% growth this year, twice the 2023 expansion of 0.4% but a slight downgrade from the 0.9% the IMF had forecast three months ago for 2024. The German economy, hurt by a slump in manufacturing and real estate, isn't expected to grow at all this year. Worldwide inflation has been cooling — from 6.7% in 2023 to a forecast 5.8% this year and 4.3% in 2025. It's falling even faster in the world's wealthy countries, from 4.6% last year to a forecast 2.6% this year and 2% — the target range for most major central banks — in 2025. The progress against inflation has allowed the Fed and the European Central Bank to finally reduce rates after they had aggressively raised them to combat the post-COVID-19 inflation surge. But just as lower borrowing costs aid the world's economies, the IMF warned, the need to contain enormous government deficits will likely put a brake on growth. The overall world economy is expected to grow 3.2% in both 2024 and 2025, down a tick from 3.3% last year. That's an unimpressive standard: From 2000 through 2019, before the pandemic upended economic activity, global growth had averaged 3.8% a year. The IMF also continues to express concern that geopolitical tension, including antagonism between the United States and China, could make world trade less efficient. The concern is that more countries would increasingly do business with their allies instead of seeking the lowest-priced or best-made foreign goods. Still, global trade, measured by volume, is expected to grow 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2025, improving on 2023's anemic 0.8% increase. India's economy is expected to 7% this year and 6.5% in 2025. While still strong, that pace would be down from 8.2% growth last year, a result of consumers slowing their spending after a post-pandemic boom. The IMF predicts that Japan's economy, hurt by production problems in the auto industry and a slowdown in tourism, will expand by a meager 0.3% this year before accelerating to 1.1% growth in 2025. The United Kingdom is projected to register 1.1% growth this year, up from a dismal 0.3% in 2023, with falling interest rates helping spur stronger consumer spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imf-s-economic-view-a-brighter-outlook-for-us-but-still-tepid-global-growth-/7832323.html	2024-10-22T06:37:41-07:00	
US, European economies diverge after pandemic as war rages	WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy is showing resilience after bouncing back from the COVID-19 pandemic but the eurozone's prospects are gloomier due to recent crises and deeper problems, according to IMF forecasts released Tuesday. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund revised its 2025 eurozone growth forecast down from 1.5% in July to 1.2% as challenges in manufacturing bog down countries such as Germany. In contrast, the world's biggest economy is anticipated to grow 2.2% next year. The United States and eurozone have seen their paths diverge over the past two years, with the U.S. economy logging 2.9% growth in 2023, significantly above the eurozone's 0.4%, IMF figures show. The fund expects the U.S. economy to expand by 2.8% in 2024, again higher than the euro area's 0.8% growth forecast. This is because 'Europe has experienced two shocks, while the United States has only experienced one,' EY chief economist Gregory Daco told AFP. After rebounding from the pandemic, which led to historic recessions around the world, European countries took a hit from the effects of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This once again sharply raised energy prices and snarled supply chains in the region, with the United States experiencing less of an impact given its distance from the conflict and greater energy independence. Germany stalls In particular, the war has made a significant impact on the eurozone's biggest economy — Germany — which saw its economy shrink in 2023. The German economy is set to see no growth this year, only expanding 0.8% in 2025, said the IMF's latest report. The 2025 figure was revised down from July's projection of 1.3% growth. 'Persistent weakness in manufacturing weighs on growth for countries such as Germany and Italy,' said the IMF. Although Italy's domestic demand is set to benefit from a European Union-financed recovery plan, 'Germany is experiencing strain from fiscal consolidation and a sharp decline in real estate prices,' the fund said. But it noted that 'in the euro area, growth seems to have reached its lowest point in 2023.' France, the second-biggest EU economy, is projected to post modest growth of 1.1% for this year and the next. US advantages Daco of EY said the United States benefits from more favorable structural factors: 'In view of its population growth, investment rate and productivity, it has growth prospects that are double those of Europe.' He pointed to a younger U.S. population and greater competitiveness. Other factors include Washington's support for households and businesses during the pandemic, which have helped to prop up consumption. Funds from the government's CHIPS and Science Act as well as Inflation Reduction Act — to boost domestic semiconductor and clean energy industries, respectively — are also stimulating the economy, he said. Meanwhile, Europe is struggling to contend with these major initiatives. A report by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, unveiled in September, aims to limit Europe's economic gap with the United States. 'It is crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi's proposals for enhancing European competitiveness,' said ECB President Christine Lagarde last Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-european-economies-diverge-after-pandemic-as-war-rages/7832312.html	2024-10-22T06:34:18-07:00

DR Congo army says it takes back Kalembe from M23, rebels deny	KINSHASA — Democratic Republic of Congo's army on Tuesday said it had taken back the eastern town of Kalembe, a day after it was seized by M23 rebels, but rebels said they still controlled the town. Kalembe, a small town in Walikale territory in militia-plagued North Kivu, came under M23 control on Sunday morning when rebels seized it from Congolese armed forces and pro-government armed groups. The Tutsi-led M23 group has been waging a renewed insurgency in the central African country's east since 2022. Congo and the United Nations accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing the group with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda denies this. Congo army spokesman Sylvain Ekenge said Kalembe had been taken back on Monday. But Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance (AFC), which includes M23, said rebels were still in control. Ekenge said fighting was ongoing between the pro-government militia and the M23 in areas that were not under army control. Military troops were flown in on helicopters on Monday morning to deal with the situation, he said. The M23's incursion into Kalembe violated an Angola-mediated ceasefire agreed in August, Angola's government said on Monday. An official from Walikale territory, Kabaki Alimasi, confirmed the army had taken the town back but said fighting continued nearby. 'The M23 are not far,' he said. 'We can hear gunfire, the population that fled has not yet returned.' The insurgency in Congo's mineral-rich east has deepened a humanitarian crisis in North Kivu, where around 2.6 million people were displaced as of end-September, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-army-says-it-takes-back-kalembe-from-m23-rebels-deny-/7832220.html	2024-10-22T04:56:36-07:00	
Vatican and China extend deal over Catholic bishop appointments	BEIJING — China and the Vatican have agreed to extend an accord on the appointment of Catholic bishops in the communist country for a period of four years, the two parties said on Tuesday. The Vatican struck a landmark deal with the Beijing government in 2018. The agreement, which was previously renewed every two years, gives Chinese officials some input into who Pope Francis appoints as bishops in the country. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson first announced the renewal at a press briefing in Beijing. The Vatican confirmed the move in a statement, saying it 'remains dedicated to furthering the respectful and constructive dialogue' with China. Conservative Catholics have criticized the agreement as handing over too much control to China. Cardinal Joseph Zen, 92, who served as bishop of Hong Kong from 2002-09, has been among the most vocal critics. The Vatican says the accord resolves a decades-long split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. The deal has never been published, but only described by diplomatic officials. The Vatican says the pope retains final decision-making power in appointment of Chinese bishops. In Tuesday's statement, the Vatican said it was hoping for 'further development of bilateral relations for the benefit of the Catholic Church in China and the Chinese people as a whole.' Speaking last month at the end of a tour of Southeast Asia and Oceania, Francis said the results of the 2018 deal 'are good.' 'I am happy with the dialogue with China,' the 87-year-old pontiff said. 'We are working with good will.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-and-china-extend-deal-over-catholic-bishop-appointments-/7832205.html	2024-10-22T04:45:05-07:00	
Lower-priced new cars are gaining popularity, and not just for cash-poor buyers	Detroit — Had she wanted to, Michelle Chumley could have afforded a pricey new SUV loaded with options. But when it came time to replace her Chevrolet Blazer SUV, for which she'd paid about $40,000 three years ago, Chumley chose something smaller. And less costly. With her purchase of a Chevrolet Trax compact SUV in June, Chumley joined a rising number of buyers who have made vehicles in the below-average $20,000-to-$30,000 range the fastest-growing segment of the nation's new-auto market. 'I just don't need that big vehicle and to be paying all of that gas money,' said Chumley, a 56-year-old nurse who lives outside Oxford, Ohio, near Cincinnati. Across the industry, auto analysts say, an 'affordability shift' is taking root. The trend is being led by people who feel they can no longer afford a new vehicle that would cost them roughly today’s average selling price of more than $47,000 — a jump of more than 20% from the pre-pandemic average. To buy a new car at that price, an average buyer would have to spend $737 a month, if financed at today's average loan rate of 7.1%, for just under six years before the vehicle would be paid off, according to Edmunds.com, an auto research and pricing site. For many, that is financially out of reach. Yet there are other buyers who, like Chumley, could manage the financial burden but have decided it just isn't worth the cost. And the trend is forcing America's automakers to reassess their sales and production strategies. With buyers confronting inflated prices and still-high loan rates, sales of new U.S. autos rose only 1% through September over the same period last year. If the trend toward lower-priced vehicles proves a lasting one, more generous discounts could lead to lower average auto prices and slowing industry profits. 'Consumers are becoming more prudent as they face economic uncertainty, still-high interest rates and vehicle prices that remain elevated,' said Kevin Roberts, director of market intelligence at CarGurus, an automotive shopping site. 'This year, all of the growth is happening in what we would consider the more affordable price buckets.' Under pressure to unload their more expensive models, automakers have been lowering the sales prices on many such vehicles, largely by offering steeper discounts. In the past year, the average incentive per auto has nearly doubled, to $1,812, according to Edmunds. General Motors has said it expects its average selling price to drop 1.5% in the second half of the year. Through September, Roberts has calculated, new-vehicle sales to individual buyers, excluding sales to rental companies and other commercial fleets, are up 7%. Of that growth, 43% came in the $20,000-to-$30,000 price range — the largest share for that price category in at least four years. (For used vehicles, the shift is even more pronounced: 59% sales growth in the $15,000-to-$20,000 price range over that period.) Sales of compact and subcompact cars and SUVs from mainstream auto brands are growing faster than in any year since 2018, according to data from Cox Automotive. The sales gains for affordable vehicles is, in some ways, a return to a pattern that existed before the pandemic. As recently as 2018, compact and subcompact vehicles — typically among the most popular moderately priced vehicles — had accounted for nearly 35% of the nation's new vehicle sales. The proportion started to fall in 2020, when the pandemic caused a global shortage of computer chips that forced automakers to slow production and allocate scarce semiconductors to more expensive trucks and large SUVs. As buyers increasingly embraced those higher-priced vehicles, the companies posted robust earnings growth. In the meantime, they deemed profit margins for lower-prices cars too meager to justify significant production of them. By 2022, the market share of compact and subcompact vehicles had dropped below 30%. This year, that share has rebounded to nearly 34% and rising. Sales of compact sedans were up 16.7% through September from 12 months earlier. By contrast, CarGurus said, big pickups rose just under 6%. Sales of large SUVs are barely up at all — less than 1%. Ford's F-Series truck remains the top-selling vehicle in the United States this year, as it has been for nearly a half-century, followed by the Chevrolet Silverado. But Stellantis' Ram pickup, typically No. 3, dropped to sixth place, outpaced by several less expensive small SUVs: the Toyota RAV4, the Honda CR-V and the Tesla Model Y (with a $7,500 U.S. tax credit). The move in buyer sentiment toward affordability came fast this year, catching many automakers off guard, with too-few vehicles available in lower price ranges. One reason for the shift, analysts say, is that many buyers who are willing to plunk down nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle had already done so in the past few years. People who are less able — or less willing — to spend that much had in many cases held on to their existing vehicles for years. The time had come for them to replace them. And most of them seem disinclined to spend more than they have to. With loan rates still high and average auto insurance prices up a whopping 38% in the past two years, 'the public just wants to be a little more frugal about it,' said Keith McCluskey, CEO of the dealership where Chumley bought her Trax. Roberts of CarGurus noted that even many higher-income buyers are choosing smaller, lower-priced vehicles, in some cases because of uncertainties over the economy and the impending presidential election. The shift has left some automakers overstocked with too many pricier trucks and SUVs. Some, like Stellantis, which makes Chrysler, Jeep and Ram vehicles, have warned that the shift will eat into their profitability this year. At General Motors' Chevrolet brand, executives had foreseen the shift away from 'uber expensive' vehicles and were prepared with the redesigned Trax, which came out in the spring of 2023, noted Mike MacPhee, director of Chevrolet sales operations. Trax sales in the U.S. so far this year are up 130%, making it the nation’s top-selling subcompact SUV. 'We’re basically doubling our (Trax) sales volume from last year,' MacPhee said. How long the preference for lower-priced vehicles may last is unclear. Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist for Cox Automotive, notes that the succession of expected interest rates cuts by the Federal Rates should eventually lead to lower auto loan rates, thereby making larger vehicles more affordable. 'The trends will probably start to change if these interest rates start coming down,' Chesbrough predicted. 'We'll see consumers start moving into these larger vehicles.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lower-priced-new-cars-are-gaining-popularity-and-not-just-for-cash-poor-buyers/7832195.html	2024-10-22T04:30:43-07:00	
New mpox variant detected in Germany	Berlin — An infection with the new mpox variant clade 1b has been detected in Germany for the first time, the Robert Koch Institute health authority said on Tuesday. The infection occurred abroad and was detected last Friday, the institute said, adding that it did not see an increased risk for Germany but was 'monitoring the situation very closely.' Mpox, a viral disease related to smallpox that causes fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash that forms into blisters, has two main subtypes -- clade 1 and clade 2. From May 2022, clade 2 spread around the world, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men in Europe and the United States. In July 2022, the WHO declared an international public health emergency, its highest level of alarm over the spread. Vaccination and awareness drives in many countries helped stem the number of worldwide cases and the WHO lifted the emergency in May 2023 after reporting 140 deaths out of roughly 87,400 cases. But this year, a new epidemic has broken out in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As well as clade 1, which mainly affects children, a new strain emerged in the DRC, called clade 1b. Clade 1b cases have also been recorded in nearby Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda -- none of which had previously detected mpox. The WHO declared another international emergency in August.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-mpox-variant-detected-in-germany-/7832186.html	2024-10-22T04:21:29-07:00	
Peru’s ex-president Toledo gets more than 20 years in prison in case linked to corruption scandal	Lima — Peru’s former President Alejandro Toledo on Monday was sentenced to 20 years and six months in prison in a case involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht, which became synonymous with corruption across Latin America, where it paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials and others. Authorities accused Toledo of accepting $35 million in bribes from Odebrecht in exchange for allowing the construction of a highway in the South American country. The National Superior Court of Specialized Criminal Justice in the capital, Lima, imposed the sentence after years of legal wrangling, including a dispute over whether Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, could be extradited from the United States. Judge Inés Rojas said Toledo’s victims were Peruvians who 'trusted' him as their president. Rojas explained that in that role, Toledo was 'in charge of managing public finances' and responsible for 'protecting and ensuring the correct' use of resources. Instead, she said, he 'defrauded the state.' She added that Toledo 'had the duty to act with absolute neutrality, protect and preserve the assets of the state, avoiding their abuse or exploitation,' but he did not do so. Odebrecht, which built some of Latin America’s most crucial infrastructure projects, admitted to U.S. authorities in 2016 to having bought government contracts throughout the region with generous bribes. The investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice spun probes in several countries, including Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador. In Peru, authorities accused Toledo and three other former presidents of receiving payments from the construction giant. They alleged Toledo received $35 million from Odebrecht in exchange for the contract to build 650 kilometers (403 miles) of a highway linking Brazil with southern Peru. That portion of the highway was initially estimated to cost $507 million, but Peru ended up paying $1.25 billion. Rojas at one point read parts of the testimony from Jorge Barata, a former Odebrecht executive in Peru, who told prosecutors that the former president called him up to three times after leaving office to demand that he be paid. Toledo lowered his gaze and looked at his hands as Rojas read the expletive-laden remarks that Barata recounted to prosecutors. Toledo has denied the accusations against him. His attorney, Roberto Siu, told reporters after the hearing that they will appeal the sentence. The former president on Monday frequently smirked, and at times laughed, particularly when the judge mentioned multimillion-dollar sums central to the case as well as when she struggled to read transcripts and other evidence in the case. Throughout the hearing, he also leaned to his right to speak with his attorney. In contrast, last week, he asked the court with a broken voice and his hands together, as if he were praying, to let him return home citing his age, cancer and heart problems. Toledo, 78, was first arrested in 2019 at his home in California, where he had been living since 2016, when he returned to Stanford University, his alma mater, as a visiting scholar to study education in Latin America. He was initially held in solitary confinement at a county jail east of San Francisco but was released to house arrest in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and his deteriorating mental health. He was extradited to Peru in 2022 after a court of appeals denied a challenge to his extradition and he surrendered to authorities. He has since remained under preventive detention. Rojas said Toledo will get credit for time served starting in April 2023. He will serve the remainder of his sentence at a prison on the outskirts of Lima that was built specifically to house former Peruvian presidents. Prosecutor José Domingo Pérez after the hearing described the sentence as 'historic' and said it shows Peruvians that 'crimes and corruption are punished.' Odebrecht rebranded as Novonor in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-s-ex-president-toledo-gets-more-than-20-years-in-prison-in-case-linked-to-corruption-scandal-/7832176.html	2024-10-22T04:06:23-07:00	
US exporters race to ship soybeans as looming election stokes tariff worries	Chicagp — U.S. soybean export premiums are at their highest in 14 months, as grain merchants race to ship out a record-large U.S. harvest ahead of the U.S. presidential election and fears of renewed trade tensions with top importer China, traders and analysts said. Nearly 2.5 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans were inspected for export last week, including almost 1.7 million tons bound for China, the most in a year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data released on Monday. But while this export flurry is a bright spot for U.S. farmers coping with low prices and hefty supplies, sellers say such heightened export demand could be short lived — leaving the U.S. with a glut of oilseeds at a time when prices are hovering near four-year lows. Tariff threats from presidential hopeful Donald Trump's campaign speeches are prompting some Chinese importers to shun U.S. shipments from January onward, traders and analysts said. Instead, these buyers are booking Brazilian soy - and paying up to 40 cents a bushel more than they would in the United States in an earlier-than-normal seasonal shift that's shrinking the U.S. export window. 'The Chinese don't know what final costs will be relative to tariffs. They are avoiding the United States from January forward,' said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co. Basse said he expects 2024/25 U.S. exports to fall 75 million bushels short of the latest USDA forecast. How China will respond to tariffs under a new U.S. administration is unclear. Trump has vowed to boost tariffs on Chinese products to around 60%, while challenger Kamala Harris' plan is to keep tariffs roughly as they are now. 'There's a threat of tariffs from either party, but more so under a Trump administration,' said Terry Reilly, senior agricultural strategist with Marex. 'With Harris, there's a real possibility that things will revert to the status quo.' Traders said premiums for immediate shipments of U.S. soy are likely to erode in the coming weeks as near-term demand is met and if trade war concerns limit new buying by China. Cash premiums for soybean barges delivered to Gulf export terminals by midweek spiked to a 130-cent premium over Chicago Board of Trade November SX24 futures on Monday, reflecting strong demand for immediate supplies, traders said. The same soybeans, if loaded next month, were available for 27 cents a bushel less, or a savings of roughly $14,000 per fully loaded 1,500-ton barge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-exporters-race-to-ship-soybeans-as-looming-election-stokes-tariff-worries-/7832155.html	2024-10-22T03:49:07-07:00	
Three Mile Island nuclear plant gears up for Big Tech reboot	THREE MILE ISLAND, Pennsylvania — Giant cooling towers at Constellation Energy's CEG.OThree Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania have sat dormant for so long that grass has sprung up in the towers' hollowed-out bases and wildlife roam inside. Armed guard stations at an entrance to the shut concrete facility, surrounded by barbed wire, sit empty. The plant, which would run so loud when operating that workers were required to wear hearing protection, is nearly silent. 'It's still eerie walking in here and it's, just, quiet,' Constellation regulatory assurance manager Craig Smith said during a tour of the plant last week. Smith, who worked at Three Mile Island when Constellation shut the site’s remaining reactor in 2019, is now preparing for a restart. Constellation announced last month that it would revive the half-century-old Three Mile Island with the purpose of fueling Microsoft's MSFT.O data centers. Microsoft is expected to pay at least $100 a megawatt-hour, nearly double the typical cost of renewable energy in the region, as part of the 20-year power contract. The agreement shows the dramatic lengths Big Tech is willing to go to procure electricity for its artificial intelligence expansion and the undertaking by the U.S. power industry to meet that demand. The effort to restore Unit 1 at Three Mile Island is expected to take four years, at least $1.6 billion, and thousands of workers to complete the unprecedented task of restarting a retired nuclear plant. Constellation has already ordered costly equipment for the site and identified fuel for the unit's reactor core, with work expected to start early next year, according to Reuters' interviews with company executives, contractors and a tour of the site. Successfully resurrecting Three Mile Island, which is widely known for a 1979 partial meltdown that cast a pall over the U.S. nuclear sector for decades, would put the plant at the front edge of an industry revival. Nuclear creates large amounts of carbon-free electricity. That is attractive to companies, like Microsoft, that have climate pledges and face increasing public scrutiny for their voracious power use. Microsoft would consider signing other power purchase agreements to restart shut plants, Alistair Speirs, senior director of Microsoft's Azure Global Infrastructure, told Reuters. 'I don't think anything's off the table,' Speirs said. Relaunching Three Mile Island would supply to the regional grid 835 megawatts of electricity - enough for all of Philadelphia's homes - to help offset Microsoft's power consumption. A restart of the plant, however, is not certain. Three Mile Island, which will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Complex, still requires licensing modifications and permitting. Local activists have also vowed to fight the project over safety and environmental concerns. If the plan suffers the same lengthy delays and cost overruns that have plagued nearly every nuclear build in the country's history, it could stymie other deals and set back Big Tech's quest to rapidly expand, power experts say. Millions of feet of building Earlier this year, Constellation finished initial testing of the plant's Unit 1 to determine whether it was financially reasonable to resurrect it. After learning that the central generator, which would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to replace, was in strong condition, the company moved ahead with its plan. 'We have a perfectly ready-to-go main generator just waiting for the rest of the plant to get started,' said Smith, standing in front of a row of massive turbines. About a thousand carpenters, electricians, pipefitters and other tradesmen are expected to be deployed to the site, said Rob Bair, president of Pennsylvania Building Trades. Work will likely start in the first quarter of 2025 with restoring two 370-foot (113-m) high cooling towers, which were stripped bare after the plant shut. 'There is a ton of equipment that has to go back in those towers,' said Bair, whose father helped build Unit 1, which opened in 1974. Workers will be hoisted up the top of the towers to install lighting and restock the buildings from within. The structures' bases, which were once made of redwood, will be refurbished with modern materials. Next, restorations inside of the plant will begin: some major equipment will be replaced. Constellation recently ordered the site's main transformer, which is expected to cost around $100 million including installation, to be delivered in 2027. Piping and electrical work, scrubbing condensers and cleaning out power generators, will be among the next tasks. A million-gallon tank will be filled with water. Much of the analog control room, with a panel installed in the early 1970s, will stay the same. A benefit of keeping the analog system is that it would be more secure against cyberattacks, officials said. Completing the job will require several million feet of scaffolding, built by scaffologists, or carpenters with special licenses, to be assembled repeatedly around the island. 'And all of that has to be done before you can even put fuel on the site,' Bair said. The company has commissioned the fuel design for the reactor's core, said Constellation Chief Generation Officer Bryan Hanson. The core holds the enriched uranium, the fuel source for the plant, stacked in pellets and sealed in tubes. Constellation, which is the biggest U.S. operator of nuclear plants, will tap into fuel from its existing enriched uranium reserves as one of the final steps before starting up. The effort is part of a recent turnaround of U.S. nuclear power, which suffered from competition from cheap fuel and fears of meltdowns, said John Ciampaglia, CEO of Sprott Asset Management, which manages a large physical uranium fund. In Michigan, Holtec is in the process of trying to restart another reactor site. Constellation's stock price has soared by 135% so far this year amid fresh projections for record U.S. power consumption next year and a doubling of data center demand by 2030. Not everyone is enthused about the prospect of a nuclear comeback. The power plants produce waste that can remain radioactive for thousands of years. About a tennis court-size amount of spent nuclear fuel from Unit 1 is stored on Three Mile Island, which sits on a strip of land in the Susquehanna River. The decommissioning of Unit 2 is still underway about 45 years after the partial meltdown. Local activist Eric Epstein, who remembers the March 1979 incident, said he will fight Constellation's request to resume operating and water use licenses. 'It's going to be a protracted battle,' Epstein said. The first chance for the challenges comes on Oct. 25, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has scheduled its initial public hearing on Constellation's plan to restart Unit 1.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-mile-island-nuclear-plant-gears-up-for-big-tech-reboot-/7832151.html	2024-10-22T03:44:06-07:00	
King Charles III ends first Australian visit by reigning British monarch in 13 years	MELBOURNE, Australia — King Charles III ends the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch in 13 years Tuesday as anti-monarchists hope the debate surrounding his journey is a step toward an Australian citizen becoming head of state. Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, watched dancers perform at a Sydney Indigenous community center. The couple used tongs to cook sausages at a community barbecue lunch at the central suburb of Parramatta and later shook the hands of well-wishers for the last time during their visit outside the Sydney Opera House. Their final engagement was an inspection of navy ships on Sydney Harbor in an event known as a fleet review. Charles’s trip to Australia was scaled down because he is undergoing cancer treatment. He arrives in Samoa on Wednesday. Indigenous activist Wayne Wharton, 60, was arrested outside the opera house early Tuesday afternoon before the royals greeted the crowd. 'It will be alleged the man was acting in an abusive and threatening manner and had failed to comply with two previous move-on directions,' a police statement said. He was charged with failing to comply with a police direction and will appear in court on Nov. 5. Wharton said he intended to serve Charles with a summons to appear in court on war crimes and for genocide but never got close to the couple. The royal visit was 'a slap in the face to every decent Aboriginal person and fair-minded person in Australia that's tried to make a go of their lives,' Wharton told the AP after his arrest. On Monday, Indigenous independent senator Lidia Thorpe yelled at Charles during a reception that he was not her king and Australia was not his land. Wharton said he backed Thorpe 'absolutely 100%.' He had protested with a small group of demonstrators outside a Sydney church service the couple attended on Sunday under a banner 'Empire Built on Genocide.' Esther Anatolitis, co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as Australia’s head of state, said while thousands turned out to see the king and Camilla at their public engagements, the numbers were larger when his mother Queen Elizabeth II first visited Australia 70 years ago. An estimated 75% of Australia’s population saw the queen in person during the first visit by a reigning British monarch in 1954. 'It’s understandable that Australians would be welcoming the king and queen, we also welcome them,' Anatolitis said. 'But it doesn’t make any sense to continue to have a head of state appointed by birth right from another country.' Anatolitis acknowledged that getting a majority of Australians in a majority of states to vote to change the constitution would be difficult. Australians haven’t changed their constitution since 1977. Constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey said an Australian republic is not something that Charles, 75, need worry about in his lifetime. She said the failure of a referendum last year to create an 'utterly innocuous' Indigenous representative body to advise government demonstrated the difficulty. 'It’s just that on the whole people aren’t prepared to change the constitution,' Twomey said. 'So a republic, which would be a much more complex constitutional question than the one last year, would be far more vulnerable to a scare campaign and to opposition,' she said. 'So unless you had absolutely unanimous support across the board and a strong reason for doing it, it would fail,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which wants to maintain Australia’s constitutional link to Britain, said he was standing near Thorpe at the Canberra reception when she started yelling at the king and demanding a treaty with Indigenous Australians. 'I think she alienated a lot of sympathy. If anything, she’s helped to strengthen our support,' Benwell said. Thorpe has been criticized, including by some Indigenous leaders, for shouting at the king and failing to show respect. Thorpe was unrepentant. She rejected criticism that her aggressive approach toward the monarch was violent. 'I think what was unacceptable is the violence in that room, of the King of England praising himself, dripping in stolen wealth, that’s what’s violent,' Thorpe told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'The violence is from the colonizer being in that room asserting his authority, being paid for by every taxpayer in this country.' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants Australia to become a republic but has ruled out a referendum during his first three-year term. A vote remains a possibility if his center-left Labor Party wins elections due by May next year. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded as having been the consequence of disagreement about how a president would be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. Sydney University royal historian Cindy McCreery suspects Australia is not yet ready to make the change. 'There's interest in becoming a republic, but I think what we may forget is that logistically speaking we're not going to have a referendum on that issue any time soon,' McCreery said. 'I, as a historian, think that it's probably not realistic to expect a successful referendum on a republic until we've done more work on acknowledging our ... complicated history,' she said. 'Becoming a republic doesn't mean that we've somehow thrown off British colonialism. It hopefully has meant that we're engaging with our own history in an honest and thoughtful way,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-charles-iii-ends-first-australian-visit-by-reigning-british-monarch-in-13-years-/7832148.html	2024-10-22T03:37:34-07:00	
Schools shut, tourists asked to leave as eastern India braces for cyclone	BHUBANESHWAR, India — Schools in some parts of India's eastern state of Odisha were ordered to shut and tourists asked to vacate the popular beach city of Puri, as authorities braced for a severe cyclonic storm that is expected to hit later this week. Cyclone Dana, currently over the Bay of Bengal, is expected to strengthen into a severe cyclonic storm with wind speeds gusting up to 120 kph (74 mph), and is likely to make landfall late on Thursday, the weather office said. Schools in 14 districts will be closed from Wednesday to Friday, and fishermen have been asked not to venture into the sea, a senior official from the Special Relief Commissioner's office, which oversees disaster management, told Reuters. Tourists and pilgrims who frequent the coastal city of Puri, home to the famous Jagannath temple, have been asked to leave, officials said, while rescue teams were on standby. Heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in Odisha was likely in the next three days, the weather office said, and the ensuing storm could damage houses, roads, crops, and power lines, causing flooding and landslides. Odisha is prone to cyclones, but has improved disaster preparedness over time, reducing damage and casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/schools-shut-tourists-asked-to-leave-as-eastern-india-braces-for-cyclone/7831353.html	2024-10-22T01:19:36-07:00	
One dead, 15 hurt in Welsh train collision	LONDON — Two passenger trains collided in Wales, killing a man and injuring 15 people, transport police said Tuesday. The low-speed crash on Monday evening happened near the village of Llanbrynmair in central Wales. 'We can sadly confirm a man has died following this evening’s incident,' said British Transport Police superintendent Andrew Morgan. Those taken to hospital were not believed to have suffered serious injuries. Morgan said transport police were working 'to understand the circumstances leading up to this collision.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-dead-15-hurt-in-welsh-train-collision/7831350.html	2024-10-22T01:10:58-07:00	
Uganda condemns 16 opposition members for 'treachery'	Kampala, Uganda — A Ugandan military tribunal Monday convicted 16 members of an opposition party of 'illegal possession of explosive devices and treachery,' according to a defense lawyer, who said the proceedings were suspect. The prosecution alleged that the 16 members of the National Unity Platform, as well as others still on the run, were found in possession of explosives between November 2020 and May 2021, while elections were under way. 'Circumstances surrounding their plea of guilty to the charges they had denied previously was questionable,' Shamim Malende, a defense lawyer, told AFP. Former singer and opposition figure Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, claimed the group had been forced to plead guilty and seek a presidential pardon. Journalists were barred from attending the session. The 16 have spent four years in jail, and will appear in court Wednesday for their sentencing. Uganda has been ruled since 1986 by Yoweri Museveni. The last presidential elections in 2021 were marred by fraud, and demonstrations against yet another arrest of Bobi Wine were violently repressed by the police, resulting in at least 54 dead. 'Whatever Museveni's government is doing, one day all those under him including himself will be called to account,' Bobi Wine told AFP, saying the accused had been 'blackmailed by state agents.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-condemns-16-opposition-members-for-treachery-/7831346.html	2024-10-22T01:02:41-07:00	
Indian doctors call off protest hunger strike over medic's murder	KOLKATA, India — Junior doctors in India's eastern city of Kolkata called off on Monday a 17-day-old hunger strike launched in protest against the rape and murder of a colleague, they said, in response to an appeal by the victim's parents. Protesters also met the chief minister of the opposition-led state, which has drawn scrutiny for its handling of sex crimes, to press their demand for better security and conditions at government hospitals, as well as justice for the woman. A police volunteer was arrested for the crime, which sparked nationwide protests in August and September, after the woman's body was found at the city's R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug. 9. 'They (the victim's parents) expressed their worries about the fasting junior doctors' health as well as the defunct health care services that must have affected hundreds of ordinary citizens,' said Dr. Debasish Halder, a spokesperson for the doctors. Some strike participants suffered severe dehydration and had to be admitted to hospital. The doctors said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee agreed to most of their demands when she met them on Monday. 'Our movement for justice and a healthy, secure healthcare system will continue,' Halder said, adding that the doctors would track progress on her assurances and orders for change. Government hospitals across India lack basic amenities such as restrooms for doctors, security personnel, and closed circuit television cameras (CCTV), doctors say. India's Supreme Court also took up the matter, but junior doctors say its efforts have not been sufficient to ensure justice. Reuters has reported that the government of West Bengal state has been slow to set up new tribunals for such crimes, while failing to deliver on its promises of better safety measures, made to doctors in 2019. India adopted tougher laws to protect women after the horrific gang rape and murder of a woman in its capital New Delhi in 2012, but activists say women are still prey to sexual violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-doctors-call-off-protest-hunger-strike-over-medic-s-murder/7831324.html	2024-10-22T00:09:30-07:00	
Son of founder of modern Singapore says he is now a political refugee	Lee Hsien Yang, the youngest son of the founder of modern Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, said on Tuesday he is now a political refugee from Singapore under the U.N. Refugee Convention. In a Facebook post, Lee, the estranged brother of former premier Lee Hsien Loong, said Britain has determined he faces 'a well-founded risk of persecution, and cannot safely return to Singapore.' 'I sought asylum protection as a last resort. I remain a Singapore citizen and hope that some day it will become safe to return home,' he said. Singapore's government said the persecution claim was baseless and unfounded, ChannelNewsAsia reported, citing a response it said was provided to the Guardian newspaper. Britain's high commission in Singapore did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling, who died on Oct. 9, have been at odds with their brother Lee Hsieng Loong, who was premier from 2004 until May this year, over what to do with their father's home after his death in 2015, in a public spat that saw the siblings estranged. Lee Hsien Yang said he had sought asylum protection in 2022, citing government persecution against him and his family, and that he was unable to return for his sister's funeral as a result. He had said last week that he would apply to demolish Lee Kuan Yew's home in line with his father's wishes. The government said in response it would consider issues related to the property in due course.	https://www.voanews.com/a/son-of-founder-of-modern-singapore-says-he-is-now-a-political-refugee/7831322.html	2024-10-21T23:58:00-07:00	
Russian state media flatters Trump, but Kremlin cool on him and Harris	MOSCOW — Russian officials from President Vladimir Putin down say it makes no difference to Moscow who wins the White House on November 5. Yet anyone watching Kremlin-guided state media coverage of the U.S. election would conclude Donald Trump is strongly favored. State TV's main Channel One news program this month showed video of billionaire Elon Musk and TV host Tucker Carlson denigrating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris before zooming in on what it cast as a series of stumbling performances. Harris' tendency to burst into fits of laughter, something Putin himself spoke about sarcastically last month, has featured prominently in broadcasts and state TV has played compilations of her least eloquent statements during the campaign. By contrast, the same Channel One report portrayed Trump and running mate JD Vance as sure-footed and imbued with common sense on everything from transgender politics to immigration, but facing sinister forces as evidenced by assassination plots. The Kremlin says the choice of who becomes the next U.S. president is a matter exclusively for the American people to decide and that it will work with whoever is elected. It has denied steering coverage, although some former state media employees have spoken publicly about weekly Kremlin meetings at which guidance on different issues is given. The state media's apparent preference for Trump may be no surprise. Trump has been far less openly supportive of Ukraine in its war against Russia than incumbent President Joe Biden or Harris, raising fears in Kyiv that it could lose its most important ally if he wins. Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin over the years and boasted of having a good working relationship, last week blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for helping start the war. This month he declined to confirm reports he had spoken to Putin on several occasions since leaving office in 2021 saying only: 'If I did, it's a smart thing.' Harris by contrast has called Putin 'a murderous dictator,' vowed to continue backing Ukraine, and said that opposition politician Alexei Navalny's death in prison was 'a further sign of Putin's brutality.' The Kremlin has denied any hand in Navalny's demise. State TV has often showcased guest speakers on its prime time geopolitical talk shows who express a preference for Trump, even if their reasons sometimes vary. Andrei Sidorov, a senior academic at Moscow State University, told a major state TV talk show in October that Trump would be better for Russia because he would stir division that could trigger a long-held fantasy of anti-Western Russian hawks - the disintegration of the United States during infighting between its constituent states. 'I am for Trump. I was always for Trump - he's a destroyer. If he's elected ... then civil war will really be on the agenda,' Sidorov said, forecasting a Democratic win would see the same 'crap' as now, continuing. '(But) Trump could really lead to our geopolitical adversary collapsing without any missiles being fired.' A 2017 U.S. intelligence report said Putin had directed a sophisticated influence campaign to denigrate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump in the 2016 race for the White House. The Kremlin denied meddling and Trump denied any collusion with Russia during that campaign. Despite the two current candidates' different approaches to Moscow, some Russian officials - who are navigating the worst period in U.S.-Russia relations since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis - have expressed wariness of both. Harris, they say, would mean a continuation of what Moscow sees as Biden's proxy war with Russia 'to the last Ukrainian.' Trump, who raised hopes in Moscow of better ties before he took office in 2017, is remembered for imposing sanctions when in the White House despite warm words about Putin. In Moscow's eyes, he appeared boxed in on Russia policy by the wider U.S. political establishment. 'I have no illusions. (When Trump was president) he had several conversations with President Vladimir Putin. He received me at the White House a couple of times. He was friendly,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recalled in September. 'But sanctions against the Russian Federation were imposed under President Trump on a regular basis. As a result, we concluded that we need to rely on ourselves. We will never in our history count on 'a good guy' getting into the White House.' One senior Russian source said there were different views at top levels of the Kremlin about Trump, but confirmed some believed a Trump victory might not go well for Moscow. 'Look what happened last time he became president. Everyone said beforehand that U.S.-Russia relations would benefit, but they ended up even worse. Trump says a lot of things but doesn't always do what he says,' said the source, who declined to be named given the matter's sensitivity. The same source questioned whether Trump's purported reluctance to keep financing and arming Ukraine and his talk of being able to end the war swiftly would survive lobbying efforts from powerful U.S. factions who argue that Ukraine's fate is existential for the West and that Kyiv must not lose. A second senior source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow was not expecting much from either candidate. Trump had been 'pretty tough' on Moscow when in power, was worryingly impulsive and had tough views on Russia's ally China, he said. The source added that he did not expect to see big change in Moscow-Washington relations whoever was elected. 'Neither Trump nor Harris are going to change the relationship with Russia fundamentally. There is not going to be some great new friendship,' said the source. 'The West views Russia and China as bad and the West as good and it is hard to see any leader changing a belief that is now ingrained within the Washington elite.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-state-media-flatters-trump-but-kremlin-cool-on-him-and-harris/7831320.html	2024-10-21T23:49:14-07:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drone attack hit biochemical plant	Russian officials said Tuesday a Ukrainian drone attack caused an explosion and fire at a biochemical plant in the Tambov region. Tambov Governor Maxim Yegorov said on Telegram the fire was extinguished early Tuesday and that preliminary information indicated there were no injuries. Ukrainian drones also damaged two distilleries in the Tula region, officials said Tuesday. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 11 Ukrainian drones over the Bryansk region, three drones over Belgorod, two over Kursk and each over the Tula and Oryol regions. The governor of Belgorod reported two homes were damaged by falling debris from destroyed drones, while the governor Bryansk said the attack damaged one building. In Ukraine, Sumy Governor Ihor Kalchenko said a Russian drone attack killed three people. Kalchenko said Ukrainian air defenses shot down 25 Russian drones in the region. US aid The United States 'will get Ukraine what it needs' to continue to fight its 32-month war with Russia, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Monday during a visit to Kyiv. But he gave no indication the U.S. would consent to Ukraine’s wish to immediately join NATO or allow Kyiv’s forces to launch missile strikes deeper into Russia. Austin said the U.S. would hand Ukraine what it requires 'to fight for its survival and security,' saying it was essential for Western allies to fend off Russia’s aggression. 'Europe’s future is on the line,' Austin said in a speech at the Diplomatic Academy of Ukraine. 'NATO’s strength is on the line. America’s security is on the line.' As Austin visited Ukraine, the U.S. announced its 68th tranche of military aid since the start of the war with Russia, about $400 million in new armaments, including munitions for rocket systems and artillery mortar systems and rounds, armored vehicles and anti-tank weapons. Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that the new U.S. assistance does not provide most of what Ukraine asked for. 'In other words, there was no new weaponry provided. Ukraine still does not have the capability to use its weaponry to strike inside Russia, and there was no discussion of a potential NATO membership for Ukraine,' she said. As fighting continues, a Russian missile attack on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia killed two people and injured 15 in the city center and caused huge damage to civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten and more than 30 residential buildings, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said. North Korean involvement Separately at the U.N. Security Council, Western officials expressed concern that North Korea may be planning to send thousands of troops to Ukraine to fight for Russia. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that there is satellite and video evidence that North Korea is sending not only equipment to Russia but is also preparing soldiers for deployment. Russia’s envoy only alluded to the accusations during a council meeting Monday on Ukraine. 'They [the West] have become distracted by circulating scaremongering with Iranian, Chinese and [North] Korean bogeymen, each one of which is more absurd than the one before,' Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. South Korea’s envoy said according to his government’s National Intelligence Service, Pyongyang has shipped Russia over 13,000 containers filled with artillery shells, missiles and anti-tank rockets since August 2023, and now they are sending troops. 'Pyongyang, according to our NIS [National Intelligence Service], has deployed about 1,500 special forces troops to Russia’s Far Eastern cities, aboard Russian naval vessels, since earlier this month,' Ambassador Hwang Joonkook said. 'The transported soldiers were provided with Russian military uniforms and Russian weapons. And to disguise their identity, they were issued with fake identity cards of residents from Yakutia and Buryatia who share similar facial features with North Koreans.' Hwang said North Korea will expect a 'generous payoff' from Moscow in return for its troops. 'It could be either military or financial assistance; it could be nuclear weapons-related technology,' he said. The U.S. envoy said Washington is aware of the reports, and if true, they are a 'dangerous and highly concerning development.' 'If Russia is indeed turning to the DPRK for manpower, it would be a sign of desperation on the part of the Kremlin,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood said. 'We know Russia is suffering extraordinary casualties on the battlefield due to the bravery and effectiveness of the Ukrainian military. Russia cannot sustain its aggression without assistance.' Ukraine’s ambassador accused North Korea of fueling and prolonging the war and said Russia is 'begging global outcasts' for weapons and troops. Sergiy Kyslytsya said according to publicly available information, about 11,000 North Korean infantry troops are being trained in the east of Russia and are expected to be ready for deployment by November 1.

China unveils first diagnosis guidelines to battle escalating obesity crisis	HONG KONG — China's National Health Commission (NHC) published its first set of guidelines to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of obesity, with more than half of China's adults already overweight and obese, and the rate expected to keep rising. The guidelines, made public on October 17, come as China experiences an upward morbidity trend of its overweight and obese population. The rate of overweight or obese people could reach 65.3% by 2030, the NHC said. 'Obesity has become a major public health issue in China, ranking as the sixth leading risk factor for death and disability in the country,' the guidelines said. China is facing a twin challenge that feeds its weight problem: In a modernizing economy underpinned by technological innovation, more jobs have become static or desk-bound, while a prolonged slowdown in growth is forcing people to adopt cheaper, unhealthy diets. Job stress, long work hours and poor diets are growing high-risk factors in the cities, while in rural areas, agriculture work is becoming less physically demanding and inadequate healthcare is leading to poor screening and treatment of weight problems, doctors and academics say. The guidelines provide guidance and regulations including in clinical nutrition, surgical treatment, behavioral and psychological intervention, and exercise intervention for obesity, Zhang Zhongtao, director of the guideline drafting committee and deputy head of Beijing Friendship Hospital, told the official Xinhua news agency. China's NHC and 15 other government departments in July launched public awareness efforts to fight obesity. The campaign, set to last for three years, is built around eight slogans: 'lifelong commitment, active monitoring, a balanced diet, physical activity, good sleep, reasonable targets and family action.' Health guidelines were distributed to primary and secondary schools in July urging regular screening, daily exercise, hiring nutritionists and implementing healthy eating habits – including lowering salt, oil and sugar. Obesity in China is an 'unintended consequence of improving living standards in the country,' Xinhua said, after China struggled for centuries to feed its population and under-nourishment was a genuine concern for many families before the reform and opening-up in the late 1970s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-first-diagnosis-guidelines-to-battle-escalating-obesity-crisis/7831311.html	2024-10-21T23:11:38-07:00	
Teen in custody after 5 found dead in shooting at home in Washington state	FALL CITY, WASHINGTON — Law enforcement officials found five people killed in a shooting inside a home southeast of Seattle on Monday morning and took a teenager into custody, police said. Several people called 911 around 5 a.m. to report a shooting in Fall City, Washington, King County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Mike Mellis said at a media briefing Monday afternoon. Arriving deputies immediately took one teen into custody while another teenager who had been hurt was taken to a Seattle hospital, Mellis said. Both teens live at the house, Mellis said. Deputies entering the home found the bodies of five people, he said. Two were adults and three were described by Mellis as young teenagers. No names have been released yet. 'Once bodies were discovered, clearly we understand that this is a hugely significant crime scene,' he said. Mellis said the shooting appears to involve members of a family, but added that they didn't yet know how they were related. He also said there was no ongoing threat to the community. 'I have no reason to think that there will be any additional arrests,' he said. The teen in custody was booked into King County’s juvenile detention facility, according to Mellis. The teen will appear in court for a first hearing on Tuesday or Wednesday, a spokesperson for the county Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said in an email. A neighbor told KING-TV that a couple and their five children lived in the home. 'I’m just in total shock, I keep bursting into tears,' Lynne Trowern, told the news outlet. An emailed statement Monday evening from King County Councilmember Sarah Perry said the shooting involved a family of seven people. Sheriff Patricia Cole-Tindall told KING-TV that she was 'very sad, very disturbed' to learn about the shooting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teen-in-custody-after-5-found-dead-in-shooting-at-home-in-washington-state/7831305.html	2024-10-21T23:03:51-07:00	
Blinken visiting Israel with focus on deescalating conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to meet with Israeli leaders Tuesday as he makes a push to revive stalled Gaza cease-fire talks, enable greater humanitarian access to Gaza and deescalate the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Making his 11th visit to the region since the conflict in Gaza erupted in October 2023, Blinken’s schedule Tuesday includes talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Months of negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar failed to secure a halt in the fighting in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas. A senior State Department official told reporters ahead of Blinken’s visit to the region that prospects for quickly reviving those talks are uncertain, particularly after Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week. Blinken is also expected to make several other stops in the region, including a visit Wednesday to Jordan. The State Department official said that without a cease-fire, discussions with Arab leaders would include trying to refine proposals for governing Gaza once the conflict ends. The official said the U.S. side has elements of a post-conflict plan it was ready to discuss directly with the Israelis as well. Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute, told VOA that gaps between Israeli and Hamas positions on any potential cease-fire terms 'still very much exist' and that he doubts there will be a diplomatic breakthrough during Blinken’s visit. 'The gaps are major, basically Israel wants Hamas not to govern Gaza anymore and not to exist in Gaza anymore as a security threat, and Hamas wants the opposite. So, beyond the immediate issue of the hostages, the deep interests and needs of each side are in contrast to each other,' Goren said. The State Department on Monday highlighted the worsening humanitarian situation in northern Gaza. 'Certainly, nobody in the U.S. government is going to stand in front of you and say that we are satisfied or find the humanitarian situation in any part of Gaza satisfactory,' State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters. 'And these are one of the things that we expect the secretary to raise directly and discuss, not just with partners in Israel but other counterpart countries on what more can be done to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. A number of border crossings are open. We are seeing truckloads enter the Gaza Strip and will continue to press for more.' U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein was in Beirut on Monday for talks aimed at trying to bring a resolution to the conflict along the Israel-Lebanon border. Hochstein told reporters he had a 'constructive' meeting with Nabih Berri, the speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, and that while in Lebanon he would speak with members of the government, the military and anyone else who is willing to work on putting the country 'on a new course of strength, security, stability and ultimately, economic prosperity.' He highlighted U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was adopted at the end of the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and includes a call for Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters to the north of Lebanon's Litani River and for Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Hochstein said nobody made any efforts to implement the resolution, adding that both sides simply committing to implementation is not enough. He repeated that the goal is to build confidence on both sides that the resolution will be carried out, and to make sure the halting of the conflict is done in a way that ensures it will not repeat in a month or a year. 'The people of Lebanon, like everyone in the region, just want to go home, build a peaceful, secure and safe prosperous future for themselves and their families,' Hochstein said. Israel says its goal is to push Hezbollah away from border areas to allow for the safe return of Israeli citizens to areas in northern Israel. Iran-backed Hezbollah launched aerial attacks against Israel following the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel. Hamas killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 others. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,600 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-visiting-israel-with-focus-on-deescalating-conflicts-in-gaza-lebanon/7831280.html	2024-10-21T21:11:30-07:00	
Singapore grants conditional approval for 1.75 GW of power imports from Australia	SINGAPORE — Singapore's Energy Market Authority (EMA) said on Tuesday it has granted conditional approval to Sun Cable to import 1.75 gigawatt (GW) of clean power from Australia. The conditional approval for the project, which is expected to be operational after 2035, recognizes the technical and commercial viability of the Sun Cable project, the EMA said. 'Sun Cable will need to update its proposal to demonstrate fulfilment of EMA's required conditions precedent before the project can be considered for an award of conditional license,' it said in a statement. Singapore's power sector currently accounts for 40% of all emissions in the country, and the EMA is seeking to import around 6 GW of clean power by 2035 in a bid to cut emissions. EMA has already granted conditional licenses for 2 GW of clean electricity imports from Indonesia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/singapore-grants-conditional-approval-for-1-75-gw-of-power-imports-from-australia/7831279.html	2024-10-21T21:00:53-07:00	
Taiwan says live fire China drills may be part of a 'deterrence' effect	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry said on Tuesday that live fire Chinese drills in a province facing the island are part of routine annual drills but also possibly part of China's 'deterrence effect' in the waters of the Taiwan Strait. China's Maritime Safety Administration, in a notice late Monday, said an area around Niushan island in Fujian province would be closed off for four hours beginning at 9 a.m. on Tuesday for live fire drills. Niushan also sits just south of the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands. Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement that those exercises were part of routine Chinese training and it was keeping a close watch. However, the ministry said it could not rule out that it was part of China's 'expanding its deterrent effect in conjunction with the dynamics in the Taiwan Strait.' It did not elaborate. China last week held a day of war games around the island Beijing views as its own territory it said were a warning to 'separatist acts'. Premier Cho Jung-tai told reporters in Taipei that China should not be carrying out any such exercises given their threat to regional peace and stability. 'No matter how large the scale of the drill is, they should not be frequent and close to Taiwan,' he said. 'This will only cause unnecessary tension.' Taiwan has complained for the past five years of regular Chinese warplane and warship missions in the air space and waters around the island. China is consistent in its criticism of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who took office in May, as a 'separatist' and has rebuffed his calls for talks. Lai rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying it is only Taiwan's people who can decide the island’s future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-live-fire-china-drills-may-be-part-of-a-deterrence-effect/7831276.html	2024-10-21T20:47:30-07:00	
Indigenous Australian embraces King Charles at civil rights birthplace	SYDNEY — Britain's King Charles was embraced by an Indigenous elder after a welcome smoking ceremony on Tuesday in the birthplace of Australia's urban Aboriginal civil rights movement in Sydney, a day after being heckled by an Indigenous senator in Canberra. Charles met with Indigenous elders at the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence in inner-city Redfern, including 'bush tucker' - or native food - chef Aunty Beryl Van-Oploo, who served kangaroo pies. The king was embraced by elder Michael Welsh, and a woman introduced herself as a member of the Stolen Generation - a reference to Aboriginal children systematically removed from their families decades earlier. 'Welcome to this country,' she said. A day earlier, Charles was heckled at Parliament House in Canberra by independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe who shouted that she did not accept his sovereignty over Australia, and demanded a treaty for Indigenous people. While the atmosphere at Redfern on Tuesday was respectful, some people who came to see the king expressed sympathy for Thorpe's actions. 'We've got stories to tell and I think you witnessed that story yesterday,' Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council Chairperson Allan Murray said. In a radio interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday, Thorpe said she 'wanted the world to know the plight of our people.' Former Olympic athlete Nova Peris, who was the first Indigenous woman elected to federal parliament, wrote in a social media post she was 'deeply disappointed' by Thorpe's actions, which 'do not reflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large.' Emotions around Indigenous rights and Australia's colonial history are raw after a national referendum on whether to alter Australia's constitution to recognize Aboriginal people was rejected last year. Charles referred to Australia's 'long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation' in a speech on Monday before he was heckled by Thorpe. Under glorious spring skies, the king later visited a social housing project designed with the support of his King's Trust Australia charity in the inner suburb of Glebe. He toured the construction site with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who grew up on a public housing estate, and met Indigenous actor Wes Patten, one of three apprentice construction workers on the project. Patten played the son of an Indigenous politician in TV political drama 'Total Control,' depicting the imagined first Indigenous prime minister of Australia. Claude Tighe, an Indigenous man in Glebe who saw the Lidia Thorpe protest on social media, said: 'I want him to talk to real traditional owners. There’s a lot of us here.' 'She spoke for Aboriginal people,' he added, referring to Thorpe. Charles and Queen Camilla are visiting Sydney and Canberra over six days before traveling to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa. The public will have an opportunity to meet the royal couple at the Opera House later on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indigenous-australian-embraces-king-charles-at-civil-rights-birthplace/7831270.html	2024-10-21T20:19:24-07:00	
US urges probe into killings of two Mozambique opposition figures	WASHINGTON — The U.S. government on Monday condemned the weekend killings by gunmen of two Mozambique opposition figures ahead of protests against a disputed election result, with Washington urging 'a swift and thorough investigation into the murders.' Why it's important The United States is the largest bilateral donor to Mozambique, providing over $560 million in assistance annually, according to the U.S. State Department website. Washington joined the European Union and Mozambique's former colonial ruler Portugal in the condemnation and the call for an investigation into the murders of opposition lawyer Elvino Dias and opposition party official Paulo Guambe on Saturday after multiple rounds were fired at a car in which they were travelling. Key quotes 'The United States condemns the killings of lawyer Elvino Dias and Podemos parliamentary candidate Paulo Guambe in Mozambique,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. 'We join the calls made by all four of Mozambique's national political parties in urging a swift and thorough investigation.' Context Mozambique police on Monday fired teargas and bullets at protesters in the capital Maputo who had gathered at the scene where the two opposition party figures were shot dead on Saturday after a disputed election. The full results of Mozambique's Oct. 9 national election are expected this week, with early results showing that the ruling party Frelimo is set for another win. Opposition candidates say the poll was rigged. Frelimo has ruled the southern African country since 1975 and has been accused of electoral fraud by opposition leaders, civil society and election observers. It denies the allegations. The State Department urged Mozambique's state institutions, political leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes peacefully and lawfully while rejecting violence and inflammatory rhetoric.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-urges-probe-into-killings-of-two-mozambique-opposition-figures/7831263.html	2024-10-21T20:10:08-07:00	
Nigerian drivers face hurdles in the transition to natural gas-powered vehicles	Nigerian authorities plan to convert 1 million gasoline-engine vehicles to run on cheaper, cleaner compressed natural gas, or CNG, by the year 2027.

Oscar leaves at least 6 dead in Cuba as massive blackout halts activities, triggers protests	HAVANA — Cuba's capital remained largely paralyzed on Monday and the rest of the island braced for the fourth night of a massive blackout that has generated a handful of small protests and a stern government warning that any unrest will be punished. Hurricane Oscar made landfall Sunday before crossing the island's eastern coast as a tropical storm Monday with winds and heavy rain, leaving at least 6 dead after a night that saw protests by several dozen people in urban neighborhoods like Santos Suárez and central Havana. Some banged pots and pans in the streets, while others demonstrated from their balconies. Protesters who said they have no water blocked at least one street with garbage. 'The country has completely halted,' said homemaker Mayde Quiñones, 55. She cares for her mother-in-law, who is in her 80s. 'This hurts everyone, but the elderly most of all.' The Cuban government has a low tolerance for civil disobedience and President Miguel Díaz-Canel warned on national television Sunday that 'we're not going to allow any vandalism, or let anyone disturb people's tranquility.' The prolonged nationwide blackout followed a massive outage Thursday night, part of energy problems that led to the largest protests in Cuba in almost 30 years, in July 2021. Those were followed by smaller local protests in October 2022 and March 2024. It's all part of a deep economic crisis that has prompted the exodus of more than half a million Cubans to the U.S., with thousands more heading to Europe. The Cuban government and its allies blame the United States' 62-year-old trade embargo on the island for its economic problems but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that the Cuban government's 'long-term mismanagement of its economic policy and resources has certainly increased the hardship of people in Cuba.' Power remains relatively cheap but increasingly unavailable. The Cuban government has said that it's producing 700 megawatts when peak demand can hit 3 gigawatts. Authorities said by Monday afternoon that about 80 percent of Havana had intermittent power but people were skeptical. 'We have the fridge full of food and we're scared,' said small-business owner Juan Estrada, 53, whose central Havana business hasn't had consistent power since Friday morning. Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy said in a news conference he hoped that more reliable electricity will be restored by Monday or Tuesday morning but classes remained closed through at least Thursday. He said that Oscar, which made landfall on the eastern coast Sunday evening, will bring 'an additional inconvenience' to Cuba's recovery since it will touch a 'region of strong (electricity) generation.' Key Cuban power plants, such as Felton in the city of Holguín, and Renté in Santiago de Cuba, are located in the area. Oscar later weakened to a tropical storm but its effects were forecast to linger in the island through Monday. Many of Havana's 2 million people resorted to cooking with improvised wood stoves on the streets before their food went bad in refrigerators. People were lining up Monday to buy subsidized food and few gas stations were open. The failure of the Antonio Guiteras plant on Friday was the latest problem with energy distribution in a country where electricity has been restricted and rotated among different regions at different times. The status of Cuba's other power plants was unclear. People lined up for hours on Sunday to buy bread in the few bakeries that could reopen. Some Cubans like Rosa Rodríguez had been without electricity for four days. 'We have millions of problems, and none of them are solved,' said Rodríguez. 'We must come to get bread, because the local bakery is closed, and they bring it from somewhere else.' The blackout was considered to be Cuba's worst since Hurricane Ian hit the island as a Category 3 storm in 2022 and damaged power installations. It took days for the government to fix them. The Cuban government announced emergency measures to slash electricity demand, including suspending school and university classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling nonessential services. Local authorities said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residential air conditioners. Later, the blackout got worse because of breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven't been properly maintained, and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Cuba's energy minister said the country's grid would be in better shape if there had not been two more partial blackouts as authorities tried to reconnect on Saturday. De la O Levy also said Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Russia, among other nations, had offered to help.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oscar-leaves-at-least-6-dead-in-cuba-as-massive-blackout-halts-activities-triggers-protests/7831229.html	2024-10-21T18:29:11-07:00	
Indian traders hopeful after China border patrol deal announced	New Delhi — After four years of heightened tensions and disrupted economic ties, India and China have agreed on a return to 2020 border patrol arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Himalayas, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar announced Monday. The agreement marks a significant step toward resolving a simmering border conflict that in 2020 saw clashes between their militaries in the Galwan Valley kill at least four Chinese troops and 20 Indian ones. 'Hopefully, we will be able to come back to peace and tranquility,' Jaishankar told Indian news channel NDTV. For many in the Indian business community, this agreement brings both relief and a fresh wave of optimism after trade ties plunged over the border tensions. Nafisul Q Jilani, a Mandarin-speaking business owner whose exhibition company thrived on facilitating trade fairs for Chinese businesses in India, said the halt in diplomatic relations resulted in a cascade of economic disruptions, including visa restrictions and diplomatic standoffs that put his business on ice. 'Business is taking a huge hit on both sides,' he told VOA Mandarin. 'Businessmen from both countries are desperately waiting for things to get better. But unfortunately, hope was diminishing day by day.' The standoffs affected entire industries. 'As of now, visas aren’t being issued, and as a result, the exhibition and travel-tourism industries are taking a huge toll,' Jilani said. 'Hospitality, transportation, tourism —everything is affected, and unemployment in these sectors is growing,' he said. But after today’s India-China agreement on patrolling the border, Jilani is hopeful again. 'This announcement brings a lot of joy,' he said. 'I’m looking forward to getting back to brisk business and helping our Chinese partners reconnect with India. Our economies are growing fast, and it's crucial for us to explore opportunities on both sides.' Jitender Chandak, a tea exporter to China, has faced his own share of challenges during the diplomatic freeze. Like Jilani, Chandak’s business has been hit hard by visa and travel restrictions. He was unable to host his Chinese business partners in India, he told VOA Mandarin. 'I’ve been running huge losses because I couldn’t invite my customers from China,' he said. Now, with better relations on the horizon from the border patrol announcement, Chandak’s optimism is palpable. 'Now that relations are set to normalize, I can finally invite my business partners and friends to India, and we can expand our business further,' he said. His optimism reflects the broader sentiment of small business owners who have been eagerly awaiting an opportunity to reconnect with their Chinese counterparts. Naresh Gupta, president of the Indo-China Chamber of Commerce, says the patrolling agreement is not only a solution to immediate tensions but also has the potential for deepening economic collaboration between the two Asian giants. 'The disengagement is a step in the right direction,' Gupta said. 'I see this as an opportunity for Indian businesses to enhance their technology adoption, improve product quality, and strengthen branding through collaborations with Chinese companies.' While the patrolling agreement is a major milestone, experts caution that rebuilding trust between India and China will take time. The standoff over the past four years has seen both nations station tens of thousands of troops along the border. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, while outlining the details of the agreement, emphasized that both countries have agreed on the 'sanctity of the LAC,' which lays the foundation for future peace and tranquility along the border. Beijing has yet to officially comment on the agreement. It was announced just a day before Russia hosts an annual summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to attend. BRICS is named after its founding members — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Indian media are speculating the deal could pave the way for direct discussions between Modi and Xi on the sidelines of the summit. When asked at a regular Foreign Ministry briefing Monday if any meeting would take place at the Moscow-hosted BRICS summit between Xi and Modi, spokesman Lin Jian said, 'We will keep you posted if anything comes up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-traders-hopeful-after-china-border-patrol-deal-announced/7831225.html	2024-10-21T18:15:23-07:00

Congressman rails at Hong Kong efforts to block US-based content	washington — A leading U.S. Democrat on China policy has called on an American web hosting company not to comply with requests from Hong Kong authorities to suspend the website of a media service founded by overseas Hong Kong democracy activists. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), wrote to web services company Automattic on Monday to ensure the webpage belonging to Flow HK, an online media outlet founded by Hong Kong pro-democracy activists who are in exile, remains operational despite pressure from the Hong Kong police. At the beginning of October, VOA revealed Flow HK to be the first overseas Hong Kong media website to be officially blocked within Hong Kong, but recent requests to remove the website internationally brought the original censorship inside China to a deeper level. In the original notice, Hong Kong police requested that Flow HK’s website be removed for allegedly violating the Hong Kong National Security Law by promoting secessionism, subverting state power and colluding with foreign forces. Automattic has not complied with these requests, a decision that Krishnamoorthi praises as 'the correct choice,' in a letter exclusively obtained by VOA. 'Hong Kong’s effort to use its National Security Law to extraterritorially remove lawful content in the United States is unacceptable, and American companies should not help facilitate such repression,' the lawmaker said in his letter. 'Crystal clear' opposition Krishnamoorthi expressed concern about what he sees as an increasing tendency of Chinese officials attempting to censor detractors abroad. 'This is not the first time the CCP has tried to use Hong Kong’s National Security Law to target overseas pro-democracy activists, and it won’t be the last. Bounties have been placed on activists, even Americans,' Krishnamoorthi told VOA. 'Congress must be crystal clear that we will not tolerate the CCP using its laws to target overseas activists, including their websites hosted here in America,' he added. Carmen Lau, international advocacy and program associate at the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council, said the Hong Kong government is more frequently using its security laws in this manner to target people outside China. 'FlowHK goes beyond just reporting news; it plays a unique role in documenting and discussing social issues,' Lau wrote to VOA. She added that the behavior of the Hong Kong government 'clearly signals that the crackdown on free speech and freedom of expression is accelerating, extending beyond borders to suppress the free speech of dissidents and the diaspora.' Flow HK was founded in early 2021 by social activists expelled from Hong Kong. 'In the face of unprecedented historical trials, it explains on its website, 'we who are scattered across the world are determined to maintain this unique community of Hong Kong people and pass on the flame of resistance.' Hong Kong has internally blocked several websites related to the protests, including the Hong Kong Chronicles, which contains personal information on some Hong Kong police officers; the Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council; the British human rights organization Hong Kong Watch; Taiwan's Transitional Justice Commission; the 2021 Hong Kong Charter, composed of Hong Kong exiles; and the June 4th Memorial Museum. Automattic, a technology company headquartered in San Francisco, provides web content management services in 92 countries and has 1,730 employees. According to its website, the company provides services for many well-known websites, social networking sites and apps, including WordPress.com, WordPress VIP, Woo, Simplenote, Newspack and Tumblr. VOA requested comments from Automattic, the Hong Kong police and Flow HK but did not receive responses by the time of publication.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congressman-rails-at-hong-kong-efforts-to-block-us-based-content/7831203.html	2024-10-21T17:34:13-07:00	
Central Park 5 sue Trump for jogger case remarks at debate	The men formerly known as the Central Park Five before they were exonerated filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. With Election Day two weeks away, the group accused the former president of making 'false and defamatory statements' about them during last month's presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. The group is asking for a jury trial to determine compensatory and punitive damages. 'Defendant Trump falsely stated that plaintiffs killed an individual and pled guilty to the crime. These statements are demonstrably false,' the group wrote in the federal complaint. The men are upset because Trump essentially 'defamed them in front of 67 million people, which has caused them to seek to clear their names all over again,' co-lead counsel Shanin Specter told The Associated Press in an email. Specter had no comment when asked if there were concerns some see the lawsuit as purely political because of the group's support for Harris. 'We are seeking redress in the courts,' Specter said. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung decried the suit as 'just another frivolous, election interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists, in an attempt to distract the American people from Kamala Harris’s dangerously liberal agenda and failing campaign.' Trump campaign officials did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise were teenagers when they were accused of the 1989 rape and beating of a white woman jogger in New York City's Central Park. The five, who are Black and Latino, said they confessed to the crimes under duress. They later recanted, pleading not guilty in court, and were later convicted after jury trials. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after another person confessed to the crime. After the crime, Trump purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. At the time, many in New York believed Trump’s ad was akin to calling for the teens to be executed. The jogger case was Trump’s first foray into tough-on-crime politics that preluded his full-throated populist political persona. Since then, dog whistles and overtly racist rhetoric have been fixtures of Trump’s public life. In the Sept. 10 debate, Trump misstated key facts of the case when Harris brought up the matter. 'They admitted, they said they pled guilty, and I said, ’well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately ... And they pled guilty, then they pled not guilty,' Trump said. He appeared to be confusing guilty pleas with confessions. Also, no victim died. The now Exonerated Five, including Salaam, who is now a New York City councilman, have been campaigning for Harris. Some of them spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, calling out Trump for never apologizing for the newspaper ad. They have also joined civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton for a get-out-the-vote bus tour. Prior defamation suits involving Trump have led to sizable amounts awarded to the plaintiffs. In January, a jury awarded $83.3 million to advice columnist E. Jean Carroll over Trump's continued social media attacks against her claims he sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store in 1996. In May 2023, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing her and issued a $5 million judgement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-park-5-sue-trump-for-jogger-case-remarks-at-debate/7831197.html	2024-10-21T17:11:54-07:00

Supreme Court rejects Cohen appeal in lawsuit against Trump	washington — The Supreme Court rejected an appeal Monday from Michael Cohen, who wanted to hold his ex-boss, former President Donald Trump, liable for a jailing he said was retaliation for writing a tell-all memoir. The justices did not detail their reasoning in the brief, a routine order released just over two weeks before Election Day, when Trump is running for another term. Cohen had asked the high court to revive a lawsuit tossed out by lower courts. Those judges found the law doesn't generally allow people to seek damages over claims they were jailed for criticizing a president, and that the situation had been dealt with when Cohen was released from custody. Cohen’s attorney, Jon-Michael Dougherty, said the ruling 'signals a dangerous moment in American democracy' and raises questions about free-speech rights. Trump attorney Alina Habba said the Supreme Court had correctly denied Cohen's petition, and 'he must finally abandon his frivolous and desperate claims.' Cohen filed the lawsuit after his early release from prison was quickly reversed. Cohen was serving time after pleading guilty in 2018 to charges connected in part to the payment of hush money to porn actor Stormy Daniels to avoid damage to Trump's 2016 presidential bid. Cohen said Trump had directed the hush money payment, a contention that later became a key part of the New York trial in which Trump was convicted this year. The former president has denied any wrongdoing. Cohen got a three-year sentence after pleading guilty and had served more than a year when he was released in 2020 as authorities worked to contain the coronavirus outbreak in federal prisons. But he was returned to prison weeks later after authorities contended he had failed to accept certain terms of his release. Cohen said he had asked if a condition forbidding him from speaking with the media and publishing his book could be removed. He served 16 days in solitary confinement before he was again freed on the orders of a judge who said he’d been jailed in retaliation for his desire to publish a book critical of the president and to discuss it on social media. Cohen sued Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr, along with various prison and probation officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-rejects-cohen-appeal-in-lawsuit-against-trump/7830923.html	2024-10-21T16:39:06-07:00	
US puts curbs on firms for supporting Iran, Pakistan weapons programs	washington — The United States added more than two dozen entities to a trade blacklist Monday over alleged support of weapons and drone development programs in Iran and Pakistan, and for other issues including aiding Russia's war effort in Ukraine. The 26 targets, mostly in Pakistan, China and the United Arab Emirates, were said to have violated export controls, been involved in 'weapons programs of concern,' or evaded U.S. sanctions and export controls on Russia and Iran, the Commerce Department said. Their addition to the so-called 'entity list' restricts them from getting U.S. items and technologies without government authorization. 'We are vigilant in defending U.S. national security from bad actors,' Alan Estevez, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security, said in a statement. 'Our actions today send a message to malicious actors that if they violate our controls, they will pay a price,' he added. Nine entities in Pakistan were accused of being front companies and procurement agents for the already blacklisted Advanced Engineering Research Organization. Since 2010, the group was said to have procured U.S.-origin items by disguising their end users, who include a Pakistani entity responsible for the country's cruise missile and strategic drone program. 'This activity is contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States,' the Commerce Department said. Six entities in China were added to the list for allegedly acquiring U.S.-origin items to support China's military modernization or to aid Iran 's weapons and drone programs, among other reasons. And three entities in the UAE, alongside another in Egypt, were said to have acquired or attempted to obtain U.S. components to avoid sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the department said. On Monday, the Commerce Department also removed Canada-based Sandvine from the entity list, after the company took steps to 'to address the misuse of its technology that can undermine human rights.' The U.S. had placed Sandvine on the trade restriction list in February 2024 for allegedly helping the Egyptian government target human rights activists and politicians. The company had been added 'after its products were used to conduct mass web monitoring and censorship and target human rights activists and dissidents, including by enabling the misuse of commercial spyware,' the Commerce Department said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-puts-curbs-on-firms-for-supporting-iran-pakistan-weapons-programs/7830879.html	2024-10-21T15:24:40-07:00	
Iran's foreign minister visits Bahrain to discuss tamping down Middle East tensions	Manama, Bahrain — Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa received Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in the Gulf state's capital Manama on Monday, state media reported, amid fears of conflict potentially spreading across the Middle East. The pair 'discussed bilateral cooperation and the latest regional developments, focusing on efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach peaceful solutions,' according to the official Bahrain News Agency. Araghchi has for about two weeks been touring the region in a diplomatic effort to tamp down tensions with the region braced for Israel's promised retaliation for arch-foe Tehran's missile attack on October 1. Israel is currently at war with two armed groups backed by Iran — Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran has balanced calls for de-escalation with threats of a fierce response to any Israeli attack. The Sunni kingdom of Bahrain, the smallest country in the Middle East, has repeatedly accused Iran of fueling unrest among its Shiite community — a claim which Tehran denies. After departing Manama, Araghchi would travel to Kuwait, according to Iran's ambassador to Kuwait, Mohammad Totonchi. Araghchi's tour of the region has also included Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Iraq, Egypt and Turkey, where he discussed potential cease-fires in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as ways to prevent the conflict from spreading. Bahrain cut ties with Iran in 2016, following in the footsteps of regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia after Riyadh's diplomatic missions in Iran were attacked by protesters denouncing the Saudi execution of a prominent Shiite Muslim cleric. Shiite-majority Iran and the Sunni kingdom of Saudi Arabia resumed ties in 2023 under an agreement that has shifted regional alliances. At the time, Tehran expressed its desire to reestablish diplomatic ties with Bahrain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-visits-bahrain-to-discuss-tamping-down-middle-east-tensions/7830847.html	2024-10-21T14:40:24-07:00	
India: Pact reached with China on military patrols along disputed border	NEW DELHI — India and China have agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020, India’s foreign ministry said Monday. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said the pact is to lead to the 'disengagement' of troops at the Line of Actual Control, the long Himalayan border shared by the two Asian giants. Misri did not specify whether it means the withdrawal of the tens of thousands of additional troops stationed by the two countries along their disputed border in northern Ladakh region, after their armies clashed in 2020. There was no immediate comment from Beijing. Misri said the pact was a result of several rounds of talks over the past few weeks between Indian and Chinese diplomatic and military negotiators, and that it will lead to 'eventually a resolution of the issues that had arisen in these areas in 2020.' The announcement was made on the eve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Russia for the BRICS summit, which also involves China. Local media reported that Modi could hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the event. Ties between India and China deteriorated in June 2020, after a military clash killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese. It turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) separates Chinese and Indian-held territories from Ladakh in the west to India’s eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims in its entirety. Both India and China have withdrawn troops from some areas on the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso lake, Gogra and Galwan Valley, but continue to maintain extra troops as part of a multitier deployment. Top Indian and Chinese army commanders have held several rounds of talks since the military clash to discuss the disengagement of troops from areas of tension. India and China fought a war over their border in 1962. The LAC divides the areas of physical control rather than territorial claims. According to India, the de facto border is 3,488 kilometers (2,167 miles) long, but China claims a considerably shorter figure. India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, said the pact is 'a product of very patient and very persevering diplomacy' and that it will resume military patrolling the way it was before the 2020 clash. 'Hopefully, we will be able to come back to peace and tranquility. And that was our major concern, because we always said that if you disturb peace and tranquility, how do you expect the rest of the relationship to go forward,' Jaishankar told Indian news channel NDTV.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-pact-reached-with-china-on-military-patrols-along-disputed-border-/7830840.html	2024-10-21T14:30:23-07:00	
World Uyghur Congress faces harassment ahead of general assembly	washington — The General Assembly of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) is set to begin Thursday, following months of ongoing harassment from the Chinese government that the top Uyghur organization has described as 'unprecedented.' In the months leading up to the group’s eighth general assembly, which takes place this year in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Uyghur organization has endured numerous efforts to derail or even cancel the event, the group said. The harassment included threats of physical harm, arrest and sabotage. Groups that advocate for Uyghur human rights have long faced harassment from the Chinese government, but this recent harassment was particularly extreme, according to Zumretay Arkin, the WUC’s spokesperson and director of global advocacy. 'It’s reached another level this time,' Arkin told VOA from Sarajevo. 'The World Uyghur Congress is among the most important organizations in our movement, in the diaspora, and they want to destroy it completely.' In one of the most severe examples, the email account of a WUC employee was hacked, Arkin told VOA. The unidentified hackers on Monday sent out emails, which VOA has reviewed, to all attendees, including WUC delegates and candidates, as well as foreign lawmakers, falsely claiming that the general assembly had been postponed. The WUC holds its general assembly every three years. At each assembly, the organization elects its leadership and sets strategic priorities in response to human rights abuses in the Chinese region Xinjiang, where most Uyghurs live. 'We are advocating for not only the human rights of Uyghur people, but also self-determination of Uyghurs. And that’s considered a threat to the Chinese government,' said Arkin, who is running to be the WUC’s next vice president. The Germany-based WUC has condemned the harassment. 'It is a clear effort to intimidate the Uyghur community and silence their voices,' the organization said in a Friday statement. In other cases of harassment, the Chinese Embassy in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has exerted pressure to cancel the general assembly entirely and indicated it would encourage local authorities to arrest former WUC President Dolkun Isa, who is a German citizen. Bosnia and Herzegovina has an extradition treaty with China. When Isa and Arkin arrived in Sarajevo on Monday, Arkin said they didn’t have any issues in entering the country. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and embassy in Sarajevo did not immediately reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment. In another example, an informant with knowledge of the situation told the Norway-based Uyghur activist Abduweli Ayup that Chinese authorities were considering various ways to disrupt the general assembly, including staging a car accident or cutting electricity. 'He told me that they might make [a] car accident and cut the electricity, or protest in front of the World Uyghur Congress,' Ayup told VOA. Chinese authorities have also directly targeted WUC delegates from countries including Australia, Germany, Ireland and Turkey, Arkin said. Those authorities have pressured delegates not to participate in the general assembly, including by making threats against family members who are still in Xinjiang, according to Arkin. And in the case of Uzbekistan, local Uzbek authorities pressured WUC delegates who live in Uzbekistan to not participate in the general assembly, according to Arkin, who said no delegates from Uzbekistan will be attending as a result. Uzbekistan’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Beijing has long targeted Uyghur rights groups and activists around the world to silence criticism, according to Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford and the former China director at Human Rights Watch. This recent bout of harassment is just the latest example. 'It’s the ultimate expression of how desperate it [Beijing] is to keep people from talking about genocide and crimes against humanity,' Richardson told VOA. The Chinese government stands accused by rights groups and multiple Western governments of perpetrating genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, which many Uyghurs prefer to call the Uyghur Region or East Turkestan. Beijing denies any wrongdoing in the region. Part of why the Chinese government is so brazen in its perpetration of transnational repression is that Beijing has long done so with almost complete impunity, according to Richardson. 'They’ve now been doing so for decades and accelerated it significantly over the last decade — and not really had to pay a price for doing so,' Richardson said. With the general assembly set to begin in just a few days, there are a lot of things on Arkin’s mind — the most pressing of which is the safety of WUC members, her family members still inside Xinjiang and herself. Nevertheless, Arkin thinks the extreme lengths the Chinese government is going to in order to derail the general assembly may also underscore Beijing’s own fears. 'We’re building a system that is our own. We’re building something totally opposite to what the Chinese government has, and so they’re scared of that. They’re scared of democracy and human rights,' Arkin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-uyghur-congress-faces-harassment-ahead-of-general-assembly/7830827.html	2024-10-21T14:18:08-07:00	
Cameroon's president returns home after more than a month’s absence	Cameroon’s president returned home Monday after more than a monthlong absence that sparked rumors and speculation about the 91-year-old politician’s health. Rumors about Paul Biya’s poor health and possible death became so widespread during his absence that the government issued statements that he was good health before banning any further public discussion on the topic. Biya’s chartered airplane arrived late Monday afternoon from Geneva at Yaounde Nsimalen International Airport. 'Today the president is on his way and this will put an end to all the speculation,' a Cameroonian news presenter said. Biya’s televised arrival showed him greeting officials, though he did not make a public address. Instead, Biya and his wife Chantal got into a car and were driven the 22-kilometer (14-mile) stretch to the presidential palace. The route was lined with supporters, many wearing outfits adorned with his image and carrying banners welcoming his return. Fru Jonathan, a member Biya's ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement Party, called media reports that civilians were either hired or intimidated to turn out en masse to welcome Biya unfounded. Billboards along the route also bore messages welcoming the president’s return and wishing him well. 'Welcome home, Mr. President of the Republic,' one billboard said, according to Agence France Presse. Earlier this month, Cameroon issued a statement that the president would return to Cameroon within days. During his absence from public life, the president missed the United Nations General Assembly in New York and a summit for French-speaking nations in Paris. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-s-president-returns-home-after-more-than-a-month-absence/7830822.html	2024-10-21T13:59:43-07:00	
White House tour upgraded so visitors can see, hear, touch more	WASHINGTON — Jill Biden unveiled Monday what she says is a reimagined White House public tour that will engage visitors' senses to teach them about the mansion's history and events that happened there. New to the tour is the Diplomatic Reception Room, which previously had been off-limits. This ground-floor room is where President Franklin D. Roosevelt recorded his 'fireside chats.' Snippets of some of those conversations will now play for visitors. Tourists will also be able to go into several other ground-floor rooms that previously were cordoned off at the doorway: the library; the China Room, which houses the collection of presidential place settings; and the Vermeil Room, which houses a collection of gold-plated silver tableware. There's also greater access to the East Room and State Dining Room, and the Red, Blue and Green Rooms, all located on the floor above, known as the State Floor. New displays, or reader rails, provide written details about the rooms, their contents and some of the history that happened there, in addition to offering experiences that encourage visitors to touch, see and hear. For example, the display in the China Room plays a brief loop of some of the place settings. In the State Dining Room, there's a replica of a prayer that's on the mantel beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln so people can now read it because they were kept too far away from it. 'As a teacher for 40 years, I know that we all learn in different ways,' the first lady, who teaches English and writing at a community college, said Monday at a White House event to mark the unveiling of the updated tour. People use all of their senses to learn, she said. 'We’ve made replicas so that you can feel the features of some of the sculpture's faces and touch the shining fabric on the furniture of the Blue Room,' she said. 'You can now hear President Roosevelt's ‘fireside chats’ in the room in which he recorded them, so you can feel as if you are there right beside him.' 'We’ve added screens and information so you can read about what you see in each of the rooms, for you visual learners,' Jill Biden said. After walking the tour route herself, the first lady decided to expand it and add more educational and historical content, according to aides. It had been decades since the tour was last updated. 'The White House tour now lets visitors touch, hear and see their history up close,' she said Sunday. Some 10,000 people tour the White House every week. When they enter through the East Wing, Jill Biden will be there on video to welcome them, while President Joe Biden will be on video in the East Room to talk about some of the history that happened there. The next president, who takes office in January, and his — or her — spouse can record their own greetings since the changes are meant to carry over from one administration to the next. Collages of printed photos that line the hallway are now digital, making it easier to change them around, while a new vertical 3D model of the 18-acre White House campus explains how the executive mansion was built and expanded over the past 200-plus years. The first lady's office has worked on the project for the past two years with the National Park Service, the White House Curator's office, the private, nonprofit White House Historical Association, presidential libraries and the History Channel, which partnered with ESI Design on the interactive experiences. The project was funded by a $5 million gift from the History Channel to the National Park Service. The White House is a national park.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-tour-upgraded-so-visitors-can-see-hear-touch-more/7830778.html	2024-10-21T13:21:32-07:00	
Displaced farmers skeptical about Zimbabwe's decision to compensate them	harare, zimbabwe — Some former commercial farmers in Zimbabwe who were kicked off their land 20-plus years ago say a government offer of compensation is woefully inadequate, and only desperate people will take the offer. Mthuli Ncube, Zimbabwe’s finance minister, said the government is starting to compensate white commercial farmers whose land was taken during the regime of longtime President Robert Mugabe. Ncube said $20 million would be shared by 94 foreign investors whose farms were seized in what Mugabe described as land reforms. The government has promised to pay another $3.5 billion to white Zimbabwean farmers. 'Both payments will start in earnest, and this is a multiyear program, it’s not for one year,' Ncube said. 'So every year we have an allocation so that we make payments [to] fulfill the constitutional requirements.' In the early 2000s, Black farmers displaced about 4,000 white commercial farmers with the blessing of the government, which said the takeovers were meant to correct colonial era imbalances. In 2013, Zimbabwe enacted a constitution calling for the government to pay the displaced farmers for land improvements. Farmers and the government reached a deal four years ago setting the amount of compensation at $3.5 billion. Zimbabwe Farmers Union Secretary-General Paul Zakariya said the government should make that promise a reality. 'Now the critical factor remains: Is the money available?' Zakariya said. 'And if it is not available, what is being done to ensure that we follow through on the provision of the constitution, as well as the provision of the global compensation agreement?' Graham Rae, who is now based in Zambia, lost his farm in Zimbabwe. He said he has no faith in Zimbabwe’s promises of compensation, partly because the payment would come in the form of government bonds, which he says have little value. 'My advice to farmers who can hold on to their deeds, hold on to your title deeds,' Rae said. 'Your title deeds are legitimate anywhere in the world. We also feel the compensation for just improvements is very, very low.' Another displaced farmer, Ben Freeth, is also skeptical. 'We've heard it all before that government is going to pay out the commercial farmers whose farms were taken over,' Freeth said. 'But we realized that government is not in a position to pay out, firstly, but doesn't really have the will to pay out. ... Paying out in government bonds, if that is what they're going to do, are going to be worthless anyway, and very few people in their right minds will take such payments.' Kudzai Mutisi, an independent but pro-government commentator, said the government’s decision to compensate the former commercial farmers is wrong. 'There is no justification whatsoever for compensating the former commercial farmers because for decades, they made huge amounts of money from that land,' Mutisi said. 'And that land, they acquired these through colonization. They never bought the land. It is something that they acquired through use of brutal force. 'But here we are: A Black government trying to compensate the abuser. It is irrational, it is bizarre and it should be stopped immediately.' The government says compensating the farmers might help improve relations with Western nations who imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe, in part, because the farmers’ land was confiscated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/displaced-farmers-skeptical-about-zimbabwe-s-decision-to-compensate-them/7830674.html	2024-10-21T12:04:06-07:00	
Police in Haiti battle gang coalition trying to seize control of capital	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Police clashed with gunmen Monday who are trying to take over one of the few communities in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, that is not controlled by gangs. Solino has been under attack since Thursday, with residents calling radio stations pleading for help as they fled their homes. Officers seized control of several areas as they keep pursuing gang members, Haiti’s National Police said in a statement late Sunday. In a video posted on social media, gang members hoisted automatic weapons in the air and cheered as they claimed control over parts of Solino, warning that all those who are not part of a gang coalition known as 'Viv Ansanm' will be 'burned to ashes.' Prime Minister Garry Conille held an emergency meeting Monday to talk about the attacks in Solino and other neighborhoods. He announced the immediate recall of several hundred police officers and soldiers from elite units protecting high-ranking officials so they could be redeployed to neighborhoods under assault. 'We will not cede strategic neighborhoods such as Solino and other recently liberated areas. The security of our citizens is non-negotiable,' he wrote on social platform X. The gang coalition has raided other neighborhoods, including Tabarre 27, with the attacks forcing more than 4,200 people to flee, according to a report the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration released Monday. More than 60% of those left homeless moved into already crowded makeshift shelters hosting others who lost their homes in recent years to gang violence. Others sought refuge at a school, a church and a health center, according to the report. Gangs that control 80% of Port-au-Prince also have threatened journalists covering the most recent attacks, calling them out by name and ordering that they be killed. Viv Ansanm, which means 'Living Together,' formed in September 2023, creating a coalition between two large gang federations that were enemies. It was responsible for launching large-scale attacks on critical government infrastructure starting in February, eventually leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The coalition also has unified to fight a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence in Haiti that began earlier this year. After the coalition was formed, armed clashes between gangs fell by 78% from March to August, compared with the previous six months, according to a report published this month by ACLED, a U.S. nonprofit that collects data on violent conflicts worldwide. 'The consolidation of the Viv Ansanm alliance has enabled gangs to focus their resources on criminal activities and confrontations with security forces, rather than engaging in infighting,' it said. The report also warned that 'despite the volatile relationships among gang members, Viv Ansanm is likely to endure as long as it faces the shared threat of an international security force.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-haiti-battle-gang-coalition-trying-to-seize-control-of-capital/7830665.html	2024-10-21T11:49:40-07:00	
Rights groups, activists in Nigeria blast police tactics against 'End SARS' memorial participants	Abuja, Nigeria — Human rights groups and activists in Nigeria are condemning police tactics used to disperse protesters who had gathered to honor those killed during a 2020 demonstration against police brutality. Witnesses say police beat and fired tear gas at protesters Sunday as they tried to gather at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos, site of the killings four years ago. Nigerian nurse Abiodun Thomas is reeling from the injuries inflicted on her leg and back by Nigerian police agents on Sunday. She was one of many activists holding a procession near the Lekki toll gate in Lagos to remember the fatal shooting of protesters at the site four years ago. She said police manhandled her, beat her, and arrested her along with 21 others. 'As we were marching towards the toll gate policemen approached us, they shot into the air, then all of a sudden they started firing canisters of teargas, that's when we started running and they gave us a very hot chase. I was apprehended and they started beating me. They hit me with the bottom of their guns three times on my right leg, one of the police officers slapped me twice,' she said. A police spokesperson said on X that they had released all the protesters in police custody, without commenting on the conduct of the officers. On the night of October 20, 2020, soldiers killed at least 12 protesters at the toll gate according to Amnesty International. The protesters were among thousands of Nigerian youths who had taken to the streets for two weeks to demand the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit. The protests dubbed 'End SARS' was the most massive in Nigeria's recent history and soon expanded to call for better governance. Thomas said since the tragic incident, every year activists try to hold a memorial to honor the slain protesters. 'Our intention was to go there, sing songs, put down flowers and make demand that the government should name that Lekki toll gate 'End SARS' bus stop to serve as a memorial for those heroes, and afterwards have drinks together and then go home,' she said. The Lagos State police authorities say protesters on Sunday flouted an order banning protests in the area except with the knowledge of state authorities. But rights groups including Amnesty International are criticizing the police. Isa Sanusi is Amnesty International's head in Nigeria. 'Saying that they need a permit from the police to stage a protest is just a bizarre and unlawful requirement, it's really unfortunate it's a renewed assault on human rights and the rule of law,' he said. Sanusi said police brutality remains a problem and that the government's more recent attempts to clamp down on free speech are only making matters worse. 'Nothing has changed about the government's attitude towards peaceful protests by citizens. We are really concerned, what we're witnessing is the emergence of a new pattern of clampdown on civic rights, especially using security agencies to deprive people of their rights, and this is unacceptable,' he said. Unless something changes, the 'End SARS' anniversary will remain a stark reminder of a struggle to end police brutality in Nigeria for good.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-activists-in-nigeria-blast-police-tactics-against-end-sars-memorial-participants/7830656.html	2024-10-21T11:45:26-07:00	
Venezuela arrests former oil czar, accused of US ties to undermine industry	CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela's top prosecutor Monday announced the arrest of a former oil minister and accused him of working with the U.S. government to undermine the industry that drives the country's economy. Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced on Instagram the detention of Pedro Tellechea, who became Venezuela's oil czar in January 2023 following the resignation of one of President Nicolas Maduro's closest allies under a cloud of corruption allegations. Saab said people in Tellechea's inner circle were also detained, but he did not name them. He did not mention any specific charges. Tellechea's tenure as head of Venezuela's most valuable industry ended in August, when Maduro reassigned his duties to the vice president and named him minister of industry and national production. Maduro replaced him Friday by appointing a close ally who was pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden last year as part of a prisoner swap. As oil minister, Tellechea was responsible for the state-owned crude company Petroleos de Venezuela, commonly known as PDVSA. Saab accused Tellechea of 'the delivery' of PDVSA's automated command and control system 'to a company controlled by the intelligence services of the U.S., thus violating all legal mechanisms and our national sovereignty.' Saab described the command system as PDVSA's 'brain.' He did not offer any evidence to support the accusations. Tellechea became oil minister following the resignation of Tareck El Aissami, who had helped Maduro and his government devise a structure to evade international economic sanctions. El Aissami left amid corruption investigations that eventually led to his arrest. Maduro on Friday appointed Alex Saab as minister of industry and national production. The new Cabinet member returned to Venezuela a free man in December after being in custody since 2020, when authorities in Cape Verde arrested him on a U.S. warrant for money laundering charges. U.S. prosecutors long regarded him as a bag man for Maduro.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-arrests-former-oil-czar-accused-of-us-ties-to-undermine-industry/7830618.html	2024-10-21T11:36:51-07:00	
Palau gears up for election amid Chinese threats, US military buildup	Koror, Palau — Driving toward the center of Palau’s commercial city of Koror, election yard signs for presidential, senate and house of delegates’ candidates in this tiny island nation’s November elections line the street as waves of the pristinely blue Pacific Ocean lap the shore not far away. The serenity of the surroundings belies just how high the stakes are in this year’s elections. Palau sits on the front line of competition for geopolitical influence between the United States and China in the Pacific Ocean. And competition between the candidates is tense, leading some to worry about how winners and losers will respond to the results once the votes are cast. 'This election is a very critical one and I just hope everything will end peacefully,' Kaipo Recheungel, a Palauan transportation service operator, told this reporter as we drove past hotels and bars along main street. Palau has some 16,000 registered voters and elections are scheduled for Nov. 5, the same day millions of American voters will choose their next president. Because Palau is one of the few countries in the world that has official diplomatic relations with Taiwan as well as close ties with the United States, Beijing will be watching the election closely. 'Palau recognizes Taiwan, and it has a strong defense and security relationship with the U.S., so undermining Palau is an extremely high priority for China,' said Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, in a phone interview with VOA. Deepening US ties Palau is one of three Pacific Island nations that receive significant economic support from the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. Under the agreement, the U.S. provides economic aid worth billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their land, water and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to their ports and territorial waters. Under the leadership of President Surangel Whipps Jr., Palau’s ties with Washington have deepened. Last month, U.S. lawmakers passed funding for key provisions in COFA for Palau. The U.S. military is also helping to repair a runway on a World War II-era Japanese airfield on the island of Peleliu and installing two radar systems on Palau. In 2023, Whipps Jr. asked the U.S. to permanently deploy Patriot missile defense batteries to Palau in response to China’s aggressive posture in the Pacific. The proposal was rejected, though, in a resolution passed by Palau’s Senate last November. Despite the Palauan senate’s rejection of the U.S. missile battery deployment, the country’s House of Delegates approved another joint resolution that supported the idea of establishing a U.S. military base in Palau. The idea of inviting the U.S. to establish a military base in Palau was first proposed in 2020 by Palau’s former president and Whipp Jr’s brother-in-law, Tommy Remengesau Jr., who is running against Whipps Jr. in the upcoming election. 'Since Palau is small, having the protection of the United States is important because we see what’s happening now in the South China Sea between the Philippines and China,' Whipps Jr., who is running for reelection in November, told VOA at his office in Koror. 'We have reefs and islands that are far away from us, and it could also be easily taken over, just like how the Chinese have invaded what are clearly Philippine reefs,' he said. Since coming to power in 2021, Whipps Jr. has been critical of China’s aggressive military activities in the Indo-Pacific region, along with what he describes as Beijing’s attempt to 'weaponize' tourism against Palau. 'In 2015 and 2016, tourism numbers from China went through the roof, which helped Palau’s economy grow 30%, but since Palau never switched diplomatic recognition [from Taiwan] to China, that number just basically collapsed in the following years,' Whipps Jr. said. In response, China’s state-run media People’s Daily said in August that the Palauan president’s comments were an attempt to twist the intention behind a travel advisory that China issued in June and an effort to 'smear and discredit China.' Beijing’s crosshairs In addition to economic pressure, some Palauan officials said the country’s national security is threatened by repeated incursions into its territorial waters by Chinese research vessels; cyberattacks linked to China; the establishment of illegal Chinese scam operations in Palau; and attempts to bribe politicians. 'The cyberattack happened just a day before Palau and the U.S. exchanged diplomatic notes on COFA, so it shows that the adversaries are watching and observing situations in Palau closely,' Jennifer Anson, Palau’s national security coordinator, told VOA at a cafe in downtown Koror. As China continues to exert pressure on Palau, Whipps Jr. said it’s important for Palau to uphold its 'special relationship' with the U.S. 'The U.S. military leaders have told me that when it comes to security and defense, Palau is considered part of the homeland, and given China’s expansionist program that’s destabilizing the Indo-Pacific region, [the increased U.S. military presence in Palau] is about deterrence and ensuring that we all continue to live in peace,' he told VOA. Despite Whipps Jr.’s emphasis on bolstering security ties with the U.S., some Palauan people, including his opponent, Remengesau Jr., say the government needs to be more transparent about the purpose and potential impact of U.S. military expansion in the country. 'The [current] government has fallen short of informing Palauan people about the intended militarization for defense purposes,' Remengesau Jr. told VOA at his home in Palau. 'Our relationship with the U.S. is supported, and we understand and abide by our partnership responsibilities, but we also need to be very clear about our concerns about U.S. militarization in Palau, including how this development will affect Palau’s environment and social fabric, as well as what is this militarization defending us from since we don’t have any enemies,' he added. Some political observers have echoed Remengesau Jr.’s concern, saying the increased U.S. military presence will 'put a target' on Palau and potentially invite further Chinese aggression against the Pacific Island nation. 'Many Palauans think President Whipps Jr.’s slogan that ‘presence is deterrence’ doesn’t make sense because now is not wartime, and they worry about what China might do if the U.S. continues to expand its military presence in Palau,' Kambes Kesolei, editor of one of Palau’s main newspapers Tia Belau, told VOA. US protection While some Palauans are concerned about the increased U.S. military presence, others say it’s important for Palau to have U.S. military protection amid intensifying geopolitical competition between Beijing and Washington in the Pacific region. 'Taiwan is a target, and Palau is a target, so I’m appreciative of the U.S. presence here because we are protected by them,' Lucius Malsol, a Palauan tour operator, told VOA at a park in downtown Koror. Despite the division over the U.S. military presence among Palauan people, some political observers say the outcome of November’s election won’t significantly change Palau’s foreign policy direction. 'A lot of Palauans are in the U.S. military and any politician in a position to make a decision takes all of that into consideration, so I don’t see how Palau could change our foreign policy direction drastically,' said Leilani Reklai, publisher and editor of Palau’s main newspaper Island Times. However, Reklai and Kesolei agree that Whipps Jr. will continue to deepen Palau’s engagement with the U.S. if he is reelected, while Remengasau Jr. would likely take a more 'neutral approach' to relations with Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palau-gears-up-for-election-amid-chinese-threats-us-military-buildup/7830584.html	2024-10-21T10:52:21-07:00	
Police in Mozambique fire tear gas at opposition politician as post-election tensions soar	MAPUTO, Mozambique — Police in Mozambique fired tear gas at the country's leading opposition politician and supporters as he spoke with reporters Monday, forcing them to run for cover. The nation remains on edge following a disputed election and the slaying of two prominent opposition figures. Venancio Mondlane, the main challenger to the decades-long governing party in the Oct. 9 presidential election, was giving interviews on a road in the capital, Maputo, near the spot where his lawyer and a senior opposition party official were killed in their car by unidentified gunmen Friday night. Police officers fired tear gas in Mondlane's direction, according to a video posted on his Facebook page. The video shows Mondlane, aides, supporters and journalists running as tear gas canisters land around them. One journalist was injured, according to local media. Mondlane previously called for a nationwide shutdown and urged people to stay away from work on Monday in protest at what he and other parties have called fraudulent elections. He and some supporters had planned to gather near the site of the killings to protest. Police fired tear gas at other protesters in the port city of Maputo earlier in the day and said there was also unrest in the neighboring province of Gaza. Six people were arrested, police spokesperson Orlando Mudumane told state-run radio. Maputo's streets were largely deserted in other parts as many stayed at home, either to observe the shutdown or to avoid the unrest. The election is likely to see the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, extend its 49-year rule since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. The final results are expected later this week, but official preliminary results show Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo with a comfortable lead on Mondlane, who ran as an independent but was supported by the new Podesa opposition party. If he wins, Chapo would succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the allowed two terms. The killings of the opposition figures heightened tensions following the election. Podesa said Mondlane's lawyer and the party's top spokesperson were chased down by gunmen in two vehicles who sprayed their car with bullets. The attack is widely viewed in Mozambique as politically motivated. Mondlane's lawyer, Elvino Dias, was closely involved in preparations to challenge the election results at the supreme electoral body. The European Union, which sent a team of election observers, called for an immediate investigation into the killings 'that will bring to justice those responsible for this outrageous crime.' The killings were also condemned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has denied, while Mozambique's security forces have been criticized for clamping down on dissent and breaking up peaceful protests with deadly force. Mondlane told reporters that police had tried to keep him at his house and prevent him from joining the protests on Monday. 'The whole of last night, police cars were at my doorstep,' he said. 'I was trying to find other ways to leave the house without being noticed. I did. I won't say how.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-mozambique-fire-tear-gas-at-opposition-politician-as-post-election-tensions-soar/7830495.html	2024-10-21T10:11:37-07:00	
Philippine court jails 17 militants for life for mass kidnapping of tourists	Manila, Philippines — A Philippine court has convicted and sentenced to life 17 Islamic militants for kidnapping for ransom 21 people, including European tourists and Asian workers, from a dive resort in Malaysia more than two decades ago, officials said Monday. The Filipino militants belonged to the small but violent Abu Sayyaf group. Among those convicted by the Regional Trial Court in Taguig city, a suburb of the capital region, were two Abu Sayyaf leaders, Hilarion Santos and Redendo Dellosa, who had been included in a United Nations terrorism blacklist, the Department of Justice in Manila said. The 17 were sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of pardon after 30 years, according to justice officials. In April 2000, Abu Sayyaf militants armed with assault rifles and machetes, traveled by speedboats from their southern Philippine jungle strongholds and raided the Sipadan Island dive resort in neighboring Malaysia, where they abducted 21 Western tourists and resort workers at gunpoint. The militants are an offshoot of the decades-long Muslim separatist unrest in the southern Philippines, homeland of minority Muslims in the largely Roman Catholic nation. The Philippines and the United States both consider the Abu Sayyaf a terrorist organization. The militants carried out bombings, ransom kidnappings and beheadings during their heyday starting in the late 1990s, but they have been weakened considerably by battle defeats, surrenders and infighting. The hostages consisted of a German family of three, two tourists from Finland, a South African couple, a Lebanese woman and two French citizens. The rest were Malaysians and Filipinos who worked in the far-flung resort. They were taken by speedboats to the jungles of the southern Philippine province of Sulu, where they were held in harsh conditions before being mostly ransomed off using millions of dollars reportedly provided by then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Two Associated Press journalists, who were allowed by the Abu Sayyaf to interview the hostages while they were in jungle captivity at the time, saw most of the horrified captives sitting on banana leaves laid on the ground and surrounded by a fence of tree branches. Some rapidly scribbled letters and begged their families and embassies to send them food, water, medicine and find ways to free them. After the hostages were freed months later, the Philippine military launched offensives that lasted several years and resulted in the killing or capture of most of Abu Sayyaf leaders and fighters. Ghalib Andang, the militant who led the kidnapping, was killed by police commandos during an attempted jailbreak and siege in a high-security detention center in 2005 in metropolitan Manila.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-court-jails-17-militants-for-life-for-mass-kidnapping-of-tourists/7830482.html	2024-10-21T09:45:57-07:00	
US missile deployment to Philippines 'incredibly important' for combat readiness, US general says	MANILA, Philippines — The U.S. Army's recent deployment of a midrange missile system to the northern Philippines was 'incredibly important' and allowed American and Filipino forces to jointly train for the potential usage of such heavy weaponry in Asian archipelago conditions, a U.S. general said Monday. The Biden administration has moved to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any possible confrontation over Taiwan and other Asian flashpoints. The Philippines has also worked on shoring up its territorial defenses after its disputes with China started to escalate last year in the increasingly volatile South China Sea. China has vehemently opposed the increased deployment of American combat forces to Asia. But it has been particularly alarmed by the U.S. Army's deployment in April of the Typhon missile system, a land-based weapon that can fire the Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, to the northern Philippines as part of joint combat exercises in April with Philippine troops. 'What it does collectively, it provides us the opportunity to understand how to employ that capability — the environmental challenges here are very unique to any other place in the region,' U.S. Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans, Commanding General of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, said when asked how the missile system has helped participants in joint combat training in the Philippines. 'Last year, we also deployed long-range fires capabilities with HIMARS and we were able to move those around with fixed-wing aircraft around the archipelago environment,' Evans told The Associated Press in an interview in Manila, referring to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, the truck-mounted launchers, which fire GPS-guided missiles capable of hitting distant targets. 'Those are just incredibly important operations because you get to work in the environment, but most importantly, you're working alongside our partners here in the Philippines to understand how those will be integrated into their operations,' Evans said without elaborating. The Typhon missile system was supposed to be flown out of the Philippines last month, but three Philippine security officials told the AP recently that the longtime treaty allies had agreed to keep the missile system in the northern Philippines indefinitely to boost deterrence despite China's expressions of alarm. The Philippine officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive U.S. missile deployment publicly. Evans flew to Manila to start talks with Philippine army counterparts on holding annual military exercises by the allied forces in the Southeast Asian country next year, particularly the Salaknib drills, which aim to boost the combat-readiness of thousands of American and Filipino troops in increasingly realistic settings. 'Conceptually, it is scheduled to be a larger, more complex exercise,' Evans said, adding that there could be joint training maneuvers from the jungles in the northern Philippines to former U.S. military bases in the region. 'We're also planning on bringing new equipment to train alongside our Filipino army teammates that last year we did not have,' he said without providing details. 'Our job is to get 1% better each day alongside our Filipino army teammates in terms of readiness,' he said. 'Those relationships that are built, the readiness that is developed, should remove any doubt about the importance of our alliances and the work we do here with the Philippine army.' Evans and other U.S. Army officials attended a ceremony Sunday marking the anniversary of a historic moment in U.S.-Philippine relations when U.S. Gen. Douglas Macarthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines in October 1944 by wading ashore into the coast of central Leyte province to help lead the liberation of the country from Japanese occupation forces. On Monday, Evans and his men laid a wreath in an austere ceremony at the American Cemetery in metropolitan Manila, the largest such U.S. World War II cemetery and memorial in the world. The Leyte Gulf ceremony reflected the long history that had bonded American and Filipino forces in war and peace, he said. 'That trust was built over eight decades,' Evans said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-missile-deployment-to-philippines-incredibly-important-for-combat-readiness-us-general-says-/7830479.html	2024-10-21T09:41:12-07:00	
Botswana's advance voting marred by ballot paper shortages	Gaborone — Early voting in Botswana Saturday was marred by irregularities, including a lack of ballot papers, forcing the electoral body to order a re-run in some voting areas. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has been criticized for mishandling the voting process as concerns mount ahead of the October 30 general election. Advance voting was open to more than 12,000 polling officers, plus thousands of police officers and army personnel. Jefferson Siamisang, secretary of the IEC, said his office did not anticipate the large turnout, which he said caused ballot papers to run out. In some of the 61 constituencies, Siamisang said there were irregularities to do with the ballot papers and voter roll. In these areas, re-runs have been ordered for next weekend. 'We apologize to the voters and plead with them to go vote again on Saturday in areas that were affected by the irregularities. We will be better prepared to ensure citizens are able to exercise their right on Election Day,' he said. The conduct of the advance voting by the IEC has attracted criticism from political parties, including the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). BDP spokesperson, Kgalalelo Kentse said the IEC must address the situation to ensure voters can exercise their right to vote. Opposition Botswana Congress Party (BCP) president, Dumelang Saleshando said his party is considering legal action against the electoral body. 'We are very concerned with what happened today. It is clear that the IEC was not prepared to conduct the elections,' he said. 'We do not want the IEC to deny citizens the right to vote on October 30 just because the electoral body is disorganized. If need be, we will take matters to court.' Opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change said it was evident that there are efforts to rig the election. The UDC will lead other opposition parties in a protest scheduled for Saturday over election concerns. Political analyst Adam Phetlhe said public perception of the IEC has been eroded following Saturday's events. 'The weekend fiasco has exposed the IEC for what it is, and it somehow confirms the widely held view that the IEC is a compromised organization which is not prepared to hold the general elections next week,' he said. Phetlhe said the situation will help advance claims from opposition parties that the poll will be rigged. 'The opposition parties are taking advantage of the situation to portray the IEC in a bad light. But I think in the absence of any credible evidence to suggest there will be vote rigging, it is something else. But that is what opposition parties do in these kinds of circumstances,' he said. For Botswana voters abroad, 10 out of 51 polling stations experienced ballot paper shortages and the IEC says those affected will also be allowed to vote this Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-advance-voting-marred-by-ballot-paper-shortages/7830447.html	2024-10-21T09:38:19-07:00	
Garbage in, garbage out': AI fails to debunk disinformation, study finds	Washington — When it comes to combating disinformation ahead of the U.S. presidential elections, artificial intelligence and chatbots are failing, a media research group has found. The latest audit by the research group NewsGuard found that generative AI tools struggle to effectively respond to false narratives. In its latest audit of 10 leading chatbots, compiled in September, NewsGuard found that AI will repeat misinformation 18% of the time and offer a nonresponse 38.33% of the time — leading to a 'fail rate' of almost 40%, according to NewsGuard. 'These chatbots clearly struggle when it comes to handling prompt inquiries related to news and information,' said McKenzie Sadeghi, the audit’s author. 'There's a lot of sources out there, and the chatbots might not be able to discern between which ones are reliable versus which ones aren't.' NewsGuard has a database of false news narratives that circulate, encompassing global wars and U.S. politics, Sadeghi told VOA. Every month, researchers feed trending false narratives into leading chatbots in three different forms: innocent user prompts, leading questions and 'bad actor' prompts. From there, the researchers measure if AI repeats, fails to respond or debunks the claims. AI repeats false narratives mostly in response to bad actor prompts, which mirror the tactics used by foreign influence campaigns to spread disinformation. Around 70% of the instances where AI repeated falsehoods were in response to bad actor prompts, as opposed to leading prompts or innocent user prompts. Foreign influence campaigns are able to take advantage of such flaws, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Russia, Iran and China have used generative AI to 'boost their respective U.S. election influence efforts,' according to an intelligence report released last month. As an example of how easily AI chatbots can be misled, Sadeghi cited a NewsGuard study in June that found AI would repeat Russian disinformation if it 'masqueraded' as coming from an American local news source. From myths about migrants to falsehoods about FEMA, the spread of disinformation and misinformation has been a consistent theme throughout the 2024 election cycle. 'Misinformation isn’t new, but generative AI is definitely amplifying these patterns and behaviors,' Sejin Paik, an AI researcher at Georgetown University, told VOA. Because the technology behind AI is constantly changing and evolving, it is often unable to detect erroneous information, Paik said. This leads to not only issues with the factuality of AI’s output, but also the consistency. NewsGuard also found that two-thirds of 'high quality' news sites block generative AI models from using their media coverage. As a result, AI often has to learn from lower-quality, misinformation-prone news sources, according to the watchdog. This can be dangerous, experts say. Much of the non-paywalled media that AI trains on is either 'propaganda' or 'deliberate strategic communication,' media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA. 'AI doesn't know anything: It doesn't sift through knowledge, and it can't evaluate claims,' Jordan, a media professor at Penn State, told VOA. 'It just repeats based on huge numbers.' AI has a tendency to repeat 'bogus' news because statistically, it tends to be trained on skewed and biased information, he added. He called this a 'garbage in, garbage out model.' NewsGuard aims to set the standard for measuring accuracy and trustworthiness in the AI industry through monthly surveys, Sadeghi said. The sector is growing fast, even as issues around disinformation are flagged. The generative AI industry has experienced monumental growth in the past few years. OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently reports 200 million weekly users, more than double from last year, according to Reuters. The growth in popularity of these tools leads to another problem in their output, according to Anjana Susarla, a professor in Responsible AI at Michigan State University. Since there is such a high quantity of information going in — from users and external sources — it is hard to detect and stop the spread of misinformation. Many users are still willing to believe the outputs of these chatbots are true, Susarla said. 'Sometimes, people can trust AI more than they trust human beings,' she told VOA. The solution to this may be bipartisan regulation, she added. She hopes that the government will encourage social media platforms to regulate malicious misinformation. Jordan, on the other hand, believes the solution is with media audiences. 'The antidote to misinformation is to trust in reporters and news outlets instead of AI,' he told VOA. 'People sometimes think that it's easier to trust a machine than it is to trust a person. But in this case, it's just a machine spewing out what untrustworthy people have said.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/garbage-in-garbage-out-ai-fails-to-debunk-disinformation-study-finds/7830414.html	2024-10-21T09:23:02-07:00	
Critics voice concerns as Pakistan parliament takes charge of picking chief justice	Islamabad — Pakistan’s government amended the constitution Monday, authorizing parliament to select the Supreme Court chief justice, a move opposition parties and independent critics slammed as an infringement on judicial independence. Until now, the judge who was second in seniority would automatically take over as the country’s chief justice when the top judge retired at 65. The amendments came just days before Pakistan’s Chief Justice, Qazi Faez Isa, is due to retire on October 25. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ruling coalition approved the constitutional changes during a special parliamentary session that opened on Sunday, a public holiday. The session lasted through the night, wrapping up just before dawn on Monday. The amendments primarily focus on Pakistan’s judiciary and mandate a special parliamentary committee to nominate the chief justice from among the three most senior Supreme Court judges. Sharif celebrated the legislation as a 'historic day' after his ruling coalition secured the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament to amend the constitution for the 26th time since its passage in 1973. 'Today, it has been established that parliament is supreme,' he told lawmakers. The prime minister mentioned allegations by politicians that the judiciary's frequent interference had impeded the functioning of successive governments in Pakistan, often resulting in their collapse. Lawmakers from the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), rejected the amendments as an attempt to subvert the judiciary and described it as a 'black day' in the country’s constitutional history. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 on controversial corruption charges and faces multiple other allegations that he rejects as politically motivated and orchestrated by the powerful military. PTI and independent critics argued that the Sharif administration amended the constitution quickly to preempt the upcoming transition at the Supreme Court amid concerns that senior judges under Isa might provide relief to Khan in various lawsuits initiated by the government. The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, or ICJ, also backed opposition concerns, saying Monday’s legislation was 'a blow to judicial independence, the rule of law, and human rights protection' in Pakistan. It noted that the amendments 'make significant institutional changes in the structure and functioning' of the judicial system, particularly the Supreme Court and high courts. The ICJ raised concerns about the absence of public consultations regarding proposed amendments introduced and passed by Parliament in less than 24 hours. 'These changes bring an extraordinary level of political influence over the process of judicial appointments and the judiciary’s own administration,' said Santiago Canton, ICJ’s secretary general. 'They erode the judiciary’s capacity to independently and effectively function as a check against excesses by other branches of the State and protect human rights,' he stated. Pakistan’s prestigious English-language Dawn newspaper also questioned the motives behind the new law. 'A fear remains that the ruling coalition may try to misuse the amendments to appoint judges of their choice... or elevate a ‘like-minded’ judge to the chief justice’s position,' the paper wrote in a Monday editorial. Khan, the 72-year-old cricket star-turned-prime minister, was ousted from power in 2022 through an opposition parliamentary vote of no confidence. The move, which the deposed leader rejected as illegal, led to unprecedented political turmoil in nuclear-armed Pakistan, a country of more than 240 million people. In June, a panel of independent United Nations experts urged Pakistan to end Khan's incarceration, saying his detention had 'no legal basis.' The military has staged three coups and placed Pakistan under direct dictatorial rule for more than three decades since gaining independence in 1947. Khan and other former prime ministers have claimed that army generals significantly influence the functioning of elected governments, even when they are not in power, charges the military rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/critics-voice-concerns-as-pakistan-parliament-takes-charge-of-picking-chief-justice/7830355.html	2024-10-21T09:02:04-07:00	
Former Albanian President Meta arrested for alleged corruption	TIRANA, Albania — Albania's left-wing Freedom Party said Monday its leader and former Albanian President Ilir Meta has been arrested on alleged corruption charges. Meta, 55, was arrested in the capital, Tirana, by officers with the National Investigation Bureau, according to local media. Local television stations showed masked, plainclothes police officers taking Meta from his vehicle after he returned from neighboring Kosovo ahead of holding a news conference. The party's secretary-general, Tedi Blushi, called it 'a criminal kidnapping.' There was no immediate comment from the prosecutor's office. After meeting Meta at the police department, his lawyer Genc Gjokutaj said the former president is being investigated for alleged corruption, money laundering and hiding personal income and property. Meta was Albania's previous president, serving from 2017-2022. He was being investigated for alleged illegal lobbying in the United States years ago. He and his former wife also have been investigated on allegations of hiding their personal property and income. Meta has been a vocal opponent of the government of Prime Minister Edi Rama, accusing it of running a 'kleptocratic regime' and concentrating all legislative, administrative and judiciary powers in Rama's hands. Corruption has been post-communist Albania's Achilles' heel, strongly affecting the country's democratic, economic and social development. Judicial institutions created with the support of the European Union and the United States have launched several investigations into former senior government officials allegedly involved in corruption. Albania seeks EU membership. Former prime minister and president Sali Berisha, now a lawmaker and leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, is also accused of corruption and is under house arrest waiting for the trial. Soon after Meta's arrest, Romana Vlahutin, EU ambassador to Tirana when the judicial reform was approved in 2016 and now a European Council official, said on social platform X, 'Justice reform in full force! There are no untouchables.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-albanian-president-meta-arrested-for-alleged-corruption/7830308.html	2024-10-21T08:28:09-07:00	
Overcrowding reported at China detention centers amid economic downturn	Taipei, Taiwan — Reports of overcrowded detention centers in China are spreading on the country’s social media platforms as Chinese law enforcement cracks down on both petty and serious crime. Analysts say China’s increasing economic challenges from the slowing economy to unemployment and a massive property crisis, are all contributing to higher crime rates and in turn an increase in detainees at detention centers. In one video posted on October 9 on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, Beijing-based lawyer Zhao Haidong describes a recent visit to the city’s Fengtai Detention Center. 'In some of the smaller rooms there are around 20 people, in bigger rooms around 30 or 40 people,' he said, adding that the number of detainees was much more than in previous years. In another video published in August, Wang Rui, a lawyer in Sichuan, says he found 20 people detained in a 12-person room. The detainees had to sleep sideways together on a 30-foot-long bed. Wang reports that China is looking to expand its detention center infrastructure. One Chinese human rights lawyer who asked to speak anonymously with VOA citing security concerns said he had witnessed similar circumstances. The lawyer said he recently visited an insurance agent who was detained in Hebei province on allegations of 'corruption.' Describing the conditions, the lawyer said, 'There are 28 people living in a detention room of more than 10 square meters, and a dozen square meters can only accommodate about 7-9 people.' VOA reached out to all three detention centers for comment on the reports of overcrowding. The Fengtai Detention Center refused to comment and said reporters must visit the center in person and present their press credentials before its liaison office would speak with them. The detention center in Hebei also refused to comment over the phone and the center in Sichuan did not respond to a request for information. Detention centers are designed to hold individuals awaiting trials and those who are arrested for petty crimes serving three or fewer months of jail time. Their overcrowding has become a problem as China has increasingly arrested more people in violation of the law. According to official statistics from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of China, 367,000 people were approved for arrest in the first half of 2024, an increase of 18.5% over the previous year. Reports also show that China has prosecuted over 761,000 people this year, an increase of almost 7%. On China’s social media platforms, lawyers cite two reasons for the increase: a tougher crackdown on crime and worsening economic hardships. Shen Yanan, a lawyer in Shandong province, says actions that were previously tolerated are now being targeted for arrest. These include illegal transactions, trade disputes, pornography, gambling, fishing and collecting protected wild herbs, reported lawyer Sun Lianwei on her social media accounts. Many online lawyers attribute the rise in arrests to increasing economic pressures and note that financial crimes have increased because of the pressure of mortgages, car loans and work. Lin Zhanhui, assistant professor at Feng Chia University in Taichung, said that China's expansion of the definition of national security, heightening levels of social stability maintenance and changing standards for illegal behavior are the reasons for overcrowded detention centers. 'The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] is constantly expanding its criminal crackdown, through the so-called rule of law. [In addition to] maintaining stability for economic crimes, mass protests and political issues [must] be stabilized through national security laws,' Lin told VOA. Taiwanese democracy activist Lee Ming-che, who has firsthand experience in Chinese prisons, believes local government corruption could also be playing into the increase in arrests. 'With China’s economic stagnation, and detention centers need to survive, local governments may be detaining more people [to] raise revenues and cracking down in these crimes that used to be overlooked,' Lee said. In China, inmates can pay to upgrade their meals and buy daily necessities. More inmates lead to more sales, increasing the revenue for the detention center and local government. Lin Zhanhui has also observed local governments in China using 'rule by law' as a means of bringing more money into local coffers. Such methods include short-term detentions and fines, he said. Additionally, Lin agreed with the assessment of lawyers online in China that economic shifts, including rising youth unemployment, corporate layoffs, factory closures and general employment struggles were contributing to the rise in overall crime. Given the rising costs of living in China, some people, he says, could even see arrest as a means to get free meals provided in detention centers. Facing harder times and more stringent laws, online legal influencers say it is the responsibility of individual citizens to avoid arrest. That is a frequent reminder that lawyers give in videos posted on social media. 'And here, I want to remind everyone: before you do anything [illegal], be sure to think twice, think twice and then think twice again,' lawyer Shi Chuang says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/overcrowding-reported-at-china-detention-centers-amid-economic-downturn/7830311.html	2024-10-21T08:14:55-07:00	
Israel busts spy ring acting for Iran, security services say	Jerusalem — Israel's security services have broken up a spy ring that was gathering information on behalf of Iranian intelligence in the latest attempt by Tehran to recruit Israelis for espionage, the Shin Bet and police said on Monday. Seven Israelis from Israel's north, including the port city of Haifa, were arrested after an investigation found they had gathered intelligence on Israeli military bases and energy and port infrastructure, a joint Shin Bet and police statement said. Israeli police said the security breach was among the most serious ever seen by Israel. 'The assessment is that the activity of the members of the ring has caused security damage to the security of the state,' a senior source with the Shin Bet security service said. Iran's foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. The suspects, who included two minors, had been tasked by two agents from Iran's intelligence service to carry out hundreds of information gathering tasks on military bases across the country, the Israeli statement said. The targets included a power plant in the northern town of Hadera, military bases with an emphasis on the air force and navy, as well as Israel's Iron Dome air defense batteries and ports, the statement said. The suspects worked in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars, part of which was processed using cryptocurrency. 'As part of the investigation, many materials seized were collected by the members of the ring and handed over to the Iranian agents,' the senior Shin Bet source said. The suspects acted out of greed for money 'and hurt the state of Israel and its citizens,' the police said. An indictment is expected to be served in coming days by the Israeli prosecutor's office. In September, Israel's security services arrested an Israeli citizen on suspicion of involvement in an Iranian-backed assassination plot against prominent people including the prime minister. Israel has a long history of intelligence operations in Iran, allegedly including the assassination in July of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in a Tehran state guesthouse. Israel has made no claim of responsibility for that killing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-busts-spy-ring-acting-for-iran-security-services-say/7830256.html	2024-10-21T07:36:42-07:00	
South Africa bows to Chinese pressure to move Taiwan office, analysts say	Johannesburg — South Africa’s decision to further downgrade relations with Taiwan, comes as the dominant political party, the African National Congress, or ANC, strives to reassure longtime ally Beijing after the formation of a coalition government, analysts tell VOA. South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation confirmed last week it had asked Taiwan to move its unofficial embassy – called the Taipei Liaison Office – out of the capital Pretoria. In a statement, the department said the liaison office would be rebranded as a trade office and moved to the economic hub of Johannesburg, which would 'be a true reflection of the non-political and non-diplomatic nature of the relationship between the Republic of South Africa and Taiwan.' 'This also aligns with standard diplomatic practice that capital cities are the seats of Foreign Embassies and High Commissions,' the statement said. It said the Taiwanese had been given six months to move. Like most countries, including the U.S., as well as international bodies like the U.N., South Africa does not officially recognize democratically ruled Taiwan, which China’s communist party considers a breakaway province — to be retaken by force if necessary. However, Taiwan has had its offices in Pretoria since the late 1990s, which deal with trade and visas. Similar offices in the U.S. and U.K. are both based in those countries’ capitals. Taiwanese officials told the island’s government-funded Central News Agency, CNA, that they believe South Africa is acting under Chinese pressure, and that they hope the South African government will reconsider. They said they had been directed to move by the end of October. Officials from the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said they would consider reciprocal measures should South Africa insist. Those could include asking South Africa to move its own offices out of Taipei, stricter visas for South Africans, and the suspension of educational exchanges, CNA reported. For its part, China welcomed the move. 'We commend South Africa’s right decision to move the Taipei Liaison Office in South Africa outside the administrative capital Pretoria,' said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. '’Taiwan independence’ finds no support from the people and will only fail.' Political change Paul Nantulya, a political analyst with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, told VOA he thought there were several reasons for South Africa’s decision. In May, the most pivotal elections since the end of apartheid 30 years ago saw the ANC lose their absolute majority for the first time. The liberation party — which had Chinese support during its fight against white minority rule — was forced to form a Government of National Unity with opposition parties that did not necessarily share its relationship to Beijing or its foreign policy objectives. The ANC has been at pains to 'reassure the Chinese side that relations between the ANC and the CCP would continue, regardless of the drastically changed political environment in South Africa,' Nantulya said. 'So we've seen the ANC really, really pushing to preserve that relationship, to persuade the Chinese that it is still a reliable partner,' he said. A South African delegation that went to a major China-Africa forum in Beijing last month included members of the Democratic Alliance, or DA, which used to be South Africa’s main opposition but has since joined the ANC in the unity government. The DA had been critical of South Africa’s close relations with China in the past, chastising China over human rights and expressing support for Taiwan. However, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said after the forum that one of his ministers 'who initially was not so well disposed to [the] one-China policy, having visited China for the very first time… publicly said that he now subscribes and embraces a one China policy.' 'And President Xi Jinping was rather pleased with that,' said Ramaphosa, who did not name the minister but was widely believed to be referring to DA leader John Steenhuisen. Under pressure However, after last week’s announcement that South Africa had ordered Taiwan to move its liaison office, the DA put out a statement expressing concern. 'We have not been provided with any motivation that justifies a unilateral change to the terms of our bilateral framework with Taiwan,' the DA said. 'It is clear that pressure is being brought to bear on Pretoria by external actors in the context of both broader geopolitical tensions, and the newly formed Government of National Unity (GNU),' the statement added. For decades Chinese pressure on the African continent to adhere to the One-China policy has yielded results. Now only one country in the region supports Taiwan: the small kingdom of Eswatini. 'What we are seeing is China flexing its might and actually pushing… one could say they are bullying African countries towards not recognizing Taiwan,' Sanele Sibiya, an economics lecturer at the University of Eswatini, told VOA. Sibiya noted South Africa was not the first country to push Taiwanese officials out of its capital. Another African economic powerhouse, Nigeria, ordered Taiwan to move out of the capital Abuja in 2017, reportedly under pressure from China. The office was moved to economic hub Lagos, despite protests from Taipei. China is Africa’s biggest trade partner and has invested heavily in the continent since the advent of Xi’s global infrastructure policy the Belt and Road Initiative over a decade ago. At the September forum Xi pledged $51 billion in funding to Africa. Recently, China has been flexing its muscles regarding Taiwan.

French government takes new blows over deal to sell painkiller maker to US fund	Paris — French drugmaker Sanofi's confirmation that it will sell a controlling stake in its consumer health unit to a U.S. investment fund sparked a new political backlash Monday, stoked by fears the deal marks a loss of sovereignty over key medications. Paris 'must block the sale' using powers to protect strategic sectors, Manuel Bompard, a senior lawmaker in the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, told the TF1 broadcaster. Politicians and unions have torn into Sanofi's proposed 16-billion-euro ($17.4 billion) deal with U.S. investment fund CD&R for a controlling stake in Opella. The subsidiary makes household-name drugs including Doliprane branded paracetamol whose yellow boxes dominate the French market. Under pressure, Prime Minister Michel Barnier's minority government said it had secured a two-percent stake in Opella for public investment bank Bpifrance and 'extremely strong' guarantees against job cuts and offshoring. Opella employs over 11,000 workers and operates in 100 countries. Sanofi said it is the third-largest business worldwide in the market for over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and supplements. CD&R — which has a battery of investments in France — would help build Opella into a 'French-headquartered, global consumer healthcare champion,' the pharma giant said in a statement. 'Just words' But with memories of drug shortages during and since the Covid-19 pandemic still raw for many, critics say the defenses are too weak. A small stake 'won't give the French state a say in strategic decisions' at Opella, said Bompard, whose LFI dominates a left alliance that is the largest opposition group against Barnier and President Emmanuel Macron. Thomas Portes, also of the LFI, posted on X that the government had offered 'no guarantees, just words.' Economy Minister Antoine Armand said a contract between CD&R, Sanofi and the government included maintaining production sites, research and development and Opella's official headquarters in France, as well as investing at least 70 million euros over five years. It covers 'keeping up a minimum production volume for Opella's sensitive products in France,' Armand added, including Doliprane, digestive medication Lanzor and Aspegic branded aspirin. There would be financial penalties for closing French production sites, laying off workers or failing to buy from French suppliers. That includes Seqens, a company re-establishing production in France of Doliprane's active ingredient paracetamol. 'Workers are not at all reassured by the latest developments,' said Johann Nicolas, a CGT union representative at Opella's Doliprane plant in Lisieux, northern France. He added that a picket had throttled production there from around 1.3 million boxes of the drug per day to around 265,000. The proposed protections in the deal have also failed to win over even some in the government camp. Monday's guarantees 'do not at all indicate a commitment for the long term, whether on investment, supply or jobs,' Charles Rodwell, a lawmaker in Macron's EPR party who has closely followed the case, told AFP. He vowed 'painstaking' parliamentary surveillance of government action over the deal including measures to 'block' the sale if ministers fall short. Brand loyalty Macron said last week that 'the government has the instruments needed to protect France' from any unwanted 'capital ownership.' Emotion over the Opella sales is closely linked to Doliprane. Boxes of the non-opioid analgesic against mild to moderate pain and fever often line entire pharmacy walls. The drug comes in many doses — from 100 mg for babies to 1,000 mg for adults — and in tablet, capsule, suppository and liquid forms. It is so ubiquitous that French people call any paracetamol product Doliprane, even when made by a different manufacturer. Sanofi, among the world's top 12 health care companies, says the planned spinoff is part of a strategy to focus less on over-the-counter medication and more on innovative medicines and vaccines, including for polio, influenza and meningitis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-government-takes-new-blows-over-deal-to-sell-painkiller-maker-to-us-fund/7830173.html	2024-10-21T06:28:23-07:00	
Should minimum wage be lower for workers who get tipped? Two states are set to decide	Mel Nichols, a 37-year-old bartender in Phoenix, Arizona, takes home anywhere from $30 to $50 an hour with tips included. But the uncertainty of how much she's going to make on a daily basis is a constant source of stress. 'For every good day, there's three bad days,' said Nichols, who has been in the service industry since she was a teenager. 'You have no security when it comes to knowing how much you're going to make.' That uncertainty exists largely because federal labor law allows businesses to pay tipped workers, like food servers, bartenders and bellhops, less than the minimum wage as long as customer tips make up the difference. Voters in Arizona and Massachusetts will decide in November whether it's good policy to continue to let employers pass some of their labor costs to consumers. The ballot measures reflect an accelerating debate over the so-called subminimum wage, which advocates say is essential to the sustainability of the service industry and detractors say pushes the cost of labor off employers' shoulders and leads to the exploitation of workers. The amount tipped workers make varies by state. Fourteen states pay the federal minimum, or just above $2 an hour for tipped workers and $7 an hour for non-tipped workers. Arizona employers can pay their tipped workers $3 less hourly than other workers. Under current rates, that means tipped workers' base pay is $11.35 an hour. Voters will decide whether to approve a measure backed by state Republicans and the Arizona Restaurant Association to change the minimum for tipped workers to 25% less than the regular minimum wage as long as their pay with tips is $2 above that minimum. The hourly minimum wage in Arizona is currently $14.35 and increases yearly according to inflation. Voters in Massachusetts are being asked to eliminate the tiered minimum-wage system. There, voters will decide on a measure to incrementally increase the state’s tipped worker wage — currently $6.75 per hour — until it meets the regular minimum wage by January 2029. The measure was put forward by One Fair Wage, a not-for-profit that works to end the subminimum wage. If voters approve the measure, the Bay State would join seven states that currently have a single minimum wage. Michigan will soon join that group after an August state Supreme Court ruling initiated a phase-out of the subminimum wage. 'When you’re not making the money that you should be making to pay your bills, it becomes hard on you,' said James Ford, a longtime Detroit-based hospitality worker. '[The ruling] makes me think we’re moving forward.' Other states have wage measures on the ballot. In California, voters will choose whether to raise the hourly minimum wage from $16 to $18 by 2026 in what would be the highest statewide minimum wage in the country. Measures in Alaska and Missouri would gradually raise minimum wages to $15 an hour while also requiring paid sick leave. In the last two years, Washington, D.C., and Chicago also have started to eliminate the subminimum wage. Employers must ensure that workers get the full minimum if they don't make that much with tips. But they don't always comply with federal labor law. One in 10 restaurants and bars investigated nationally by the U.S. Labor Department between 2010 and 2019 violated a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, resulting in the establishments paying $113.9 million in back wages. The issue disproportionately affects women, who make up about 47% of the U.S. workforce but nearly 70% of those who work in tipped professions, according to an AP analysis of U.S. Census data. In Arizona, Republican state Sen. J.D. Mesnard, the sponsor of Proposition 138, said the measure is a win for both businesses and lower-wage workers. 'The employer is protected in the sense that they can preserve this lower base, knowing that there are going to be tips on top of it,' Mesnard said. 'The tipped worker is guaranteed to make more than minimum wage, which is more than they’re guaranteed today.' Nichols doesn't support it. 'It would reduce my hourly, and anything that reduces my hourly is not something that I want to lean into,' she said. 'I don’t believe that business owners need any more cuts in labor costs.' Proposition 138 was initially put forward as a response to a ballot measure pushed by One Fair Wage that would create a single minimum wage of $18, but the group abandoned the effort after threats of litigation from the restaurant association over how it collected signatures. Instead, One Fair Wage will focus on trying to pass a wage hike in the Legislature. Democratic State Rep. Mariana Sandoval said she hopes her party in November can flip the Legislature, where Republicans hold a one-seat majority in both chambers. After working for tips for more than 20 years, server Lindsay Ruck, who works at a restaurant at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, said she’s faced her fair share of belligerent customers. But because their tips make up such a significant part of her pay — approximately $60 an hour — she’s hesitant to stand up to them. To Ruck, higher base pay — not less — is called for. 'I think that there should be just a single minimum wage and then people should get tipped on top of that,' Ruck said. The National Restaurant Association and its state affiliates warn of reduced hours, lower employment and menu price hikes if employers can’t rely on tips to pay their workers. That’s why Dan Piacquadio, a co-owner of Harold’s Cave Creek Corral restaurant outside Phoenix, is hoping voters pass Proposition 138. 'This is just a way to protect our current system that’s been there for 20 years and protect restaurant owners, keep restaurants affordable, and most importantly, keep very good pay for all tipped workers,' Piacquadio said. Between 2012 and 2019, the number of restaurants and people employed at those restaurants grew at a faster clip in the seven states that have a single minimum wage compared to states that pay the federal minimum tipped wage, according to labor economist Sylvia Allegretto. 'We are sitting here in a state that has a $16 minimum wage,' Allegretto said from Oakland, California, where she works at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. 'No subminimum wage, and we’ve got a thriving restaurant industry.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/should-minimum-wage-be-lower-for-workers-who-get-tipped-two-states-are-set-to-decide/7830160.html	2024-10-21T06:26:00-07:00	
Russia on track to ban adoptions from countries allowing gender change	In late September, the Russian parliament backed new legislation that will make it harder for some people to adopt children from the country. Some adoption advocates say the legislation is really designed to punish the West. VOA Russian has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

Germany inaugurates Baltic Sea naval HQ amid rising tensions with Moscow	Berlin — Germany inaugurated on Monday a new multinational naval headquarters for the Baltic Sea capable of leading operations for NATO during a conflict, as the military alliance increases focus on the area amid rising tensions with Russia. 'Our message to our partners and to those who threaten our peace is simple: Germany stands firmly by its commitments,' Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said, according to a draft of his speech at a ceremony at the country's naval command in the coastal city of Rostock, where the headquarters is located. 'The headquarters will play a crucial role in the preparation of military situation reports and in responding to regional challenges, including the protection of NATO member states' interests against aggressive actions, particularly given the proximity of Russia.' The establishment of the facility highlights the crucial importance of the Baltic Sea for NATO after relations with Russia deteriorated following the Ukraine war, with Moscow's Baltic Fleet based near Kaliningrad. Securing open sea routes through the Baltic Sea has become vital to the alliance since its eastern expansion after the end of the Cold War that saw Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and lately Finland and Sweden to the north, join NATO. In the past, NATO's main role would have been to block the western entrance to the Baltic Sea to prevent the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet from reaching the North Sea, where its warships could attack U.S. supply convoys crucial to Europe's defense. Today, NATO must ensure the sea routes remain open since they might constitute the only supply line to the Baltic states should the narrow overland corridor linking them to Poland, and thus the rest of NATO territory in Europe, be blocked in any conflict with Russia. Only two roads and one railroad line run through the 65 km wide corridor — the Suwalki Gap — that is squeezed between the heavily armed Russian exclave of Kaliningrad to the west and Belarus to the east. Owning the biggest navy in the region, Germany has been concerned by Moscow's presence in the Baltic Sea for a while. After Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Berlin forged an alliance of the western navies bordering the Baltic Sea. The new headquarters, with around 120 German and up to 60 international staff in peacetime, will be led by a German admiral with a Polish deputy and a Swedish chief of staff. Eleven nations have deployed personnel there — Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Britain, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-inaugurates-baltic-sea-naval-hq-amid-rising-tensions-with-moscow-/7830030.html	2024-10-21T04:27:56-07:00	
Gulen, the powerful cleric accused of orchestrating a Turkish coup, dies	ISTANBUL — The U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years mired in accusations of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish leader Tayyip Erdogan, has died. He was 83. Herkul, a website which publishes Gulen's sermons, said on its X account that Gulen had died on Sunday evening in the U.S. hospital where he was being treated. Gulen was a one-time ally of Erdogan but they fell out spectacularly, and Erdogan held him responsible for the 2016 attempted coup in which rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, tanks and helicopters. Some 250 people were killed in the bid to seize power. Gulen, who had lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denied involvement in the putsch but his movement was designated as a terrorist group by Turkey. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed his death, describing him as the leader of a 'dark organization' and saying that Turkey's fight against the group would continue. 'Our nation's determination in the fight against terrorism will continue, and this news of his death will never lead us to complacency,' Fidan told a press conference. According to its followers, Gulen's movement - known as 'Hizmet' which means 'service' in Turkish - seeks to spread a moderate brand of Islam that promotes Western-style education, free markets and interfaith communication. Since the failed coup, his movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its international influence has declined. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gulen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. The son of an imam, or Islamic preacher, he studied the Koran from infancy. In 1959, Gulen was appointed as a mosque imam in the northwestern city of Edirne and came to prominence as a preacher in the 1960s in the western province of Izmir, where he set up student dormitories and would go to tea houses to preach. These student houses marked the start of an informal network which would spread in coming decades through education, business, media and state institutions. His influence also spread beyond Turkey's borders to the Turkic republics of Central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the West through a network of schools. Fidan said he hoped Gulen's death would lift a 'spell' over Turkish youth who had taken a path of 'betrayal' against their country under the pretense of religious values. 'This is not a good road,' he added. Former Erdogan ally Gulen had been a close ally of Erdogan and his AK Party, but growing tensions in their relationship exploded in December 2013 when corruption investigations targeting ministers and officials close to Erdogan came to light. Prosecutors and police from Gulen's Hizmet movement were widely believed to be behind the investigations and an arrest warrant was issued for Gulen in 2014. His movement was designated as a terrorist group two years later. Soon after the 2016 coup, Erdogan described Gulen's network as traitors and 'like a cancer,' vowing to root them out wherever they are. Hundreds of schools, companies, media outlets and associations linked to him were shut down and assets seized. Gulen condemned the coup attempt 'in the strongest terms.' 'As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,' he said. In a post-coup crackdown, which the government said targeted Gulen's followers, at least 77,000 people were arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers suspended under emergency rule. Companies and media outlets regarded as linked to Gulen were seized by the state or closed down. The government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gulen was also reviled by Turkey's opposition, which saw his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic. Ankara long sought to have him extradited from the United States. Speaking in his gated compound in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, Gulen said in a 2017 Reuters interview he had no plans to flee the United States to avoid extradition. Even then, he appeared frail, keeping his longtime doctor close at hand.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gulen-the-powerful-cleric-accused-of-orchestrating-a-turkish-coup-dies-/7830012.html	2024-10-21T04:07:22-07:00	
Vietnam parliament elects army general as state president	HANOI — Vietnam's parliament elected on Monday army general Luong Cuong as the new state president in a widely anticipated move that is expected to bring some stability to Vietnamese politics after a turbulent phase of departures and reshuffles. Cuong, 67, takes over the role from To Lam, who was appointed president of the Communist-run, one-party country in May and then also took on the more powerful job of party chief following the death in July of general secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. Cuong was elected with the vote of all the 440 deputies who attended the parliament session on Monday. In his inaugural speech he committed to boosting defense capabilities and pursuing an independent and multilateral foreign policy. He vowed to 'strengthen national defense and security, build up an army force that is revolutionary, well-trained, nimble and modern'. Vietnam has long been seeking to diversify its arsenal from mostly Russia-made weapons but has not reported any significant deal in recent years. Before the election, Cuong held a key position in the secretariat of the Communist Party, which made him the fifth-highest ranking official in the country after party chief, president, prime minister and parliament's chairman. Cuong is also a member of the Politburo, the party's top decision-making body. The state president holds little direct power but represents the country in high-level meetings with foreign dignitaries. In his short spell as president, Lam has met the leaders of China, Russia and the United States, among others. Power sharing In Vietnam, the party chief has become the most powerful figure since the late Trong effectively expanded the role's powers in his 13-year tenure. The move by Lam, a former head of police, to relinquish the presidency may indicate a power-sharing compromise within the party, multiple diplomats said. Foreign multinationals, who have large investments in the Southeast Asian country for export-oriented manufacturing, had long praised Vietnam's political stability. Many were taken aback by recent turmoil in the leadership amid an anti-corruption campaign that led to the resignation of two state presidents and one parliament chairman in the 17 months before Lam's election. The new power-sharing arrangement is set to last until 2026, when all top positions will again be up for grabs as part of a regular five-year reorganization of the political leadership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-parliament-elects-army-general-as-state-president/7830007.html	2024-10-21T03:58:05-07:00	
US envoy in Beirut for talks with Lebanese officials	The Israeli military apologized Monday for killing three Lebanese soldiers in a strike in southern Lebanon, while a U.S. envoy arrived in Beirut for talks with Lebanese officials about potential conditions for a cease-fire between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group. An Israeli military spokesperson said Sunday’s attack hit a vehicle owned by the Lebanese army, and that Israel is not operating against the Lebanese military. U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein’s visit to Beirut included planned talks with Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, as well as Nabih Berri, the speaker of parliament. In addition to efforts to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the United States is also pressuring Lebanese lawmakers to move forward with electing a president as part of a push to strengthen government institutions. The Lebanese military has not played a part in the conflict, which has escalated during the past month with a widening of Israel’s airstrike campaign and Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon. Israel says its goal is to push Hezbollah away from border areas in order to allow for the safe return of Israeli citizens to areas in northern Israel. 'Hezbollah has paid and will continue to pay a heavy price for its attacks on northern Israel and its rocket fire,' Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Monday on X. 'We will keep striking the Iranian proxy until it collapses.' Monday brought continued Israeli airstrikes in Beirut and in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military saying it targeted al-Qard al-Hassan, a Hezbollah-linked financial firm used to pay militants and buy arms, but which is also used by Lebanese civilians for financial services. The United States has sanctioned al-Qard al-Hassan. The Israeli campaign in southern Lebanon has also brought complaints from the U.N. peacekeeping force UNIFIL about Israel’s conduct. The latest incident included what UNIFIL said was an IDF bulldozer intentionally destroying a UNIFIL observation tower and perimeter fence. 'The IDF has repeatedly demanded that UNIFIL vacate its positions along the Blue Line and has deliberately damaged UN positions,' UNIFIL said in a statement late Sunday. 'Despite the pressure being exerted on the mission and our troop-contributing countries, peacekeepers remain in all positions. We will continue to undertake our mandated tasks to monitor and report.' Iran-backed Hezbollah launched aerial attacks against Israel following the October 2023 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel. Hamas killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 others. Israel’s counteroffensive in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 42,600 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-in-beirut-for-talks-with-lebanese-officials-/7829956.html	2024-10-21T03:10:20-07:00	
Microsoft to allow autonomous AI agent development starting next month	Microsoft will allow customers to build autonomous artificial intelligence agents starting in November, the software giant said on Monday, in its latest move to tap the booming technology. The company is positioning autonomous agents — programs which require little human intervention unlike chatbots — as 'apps for an AI-driven world,' capable of handling client inquiries, identifying sales leads and managing inventory. Other big technology firms such as Salesforce have also touted the potential of such agents, tools that some analysts say could provide companies with an easier path to monetizing the billions of dollars they are pouring into AI. Microsoft said its customers can use Copilot Studio - an application that requires little knowledge of computer code - to create autonomous agents in public preview from November. It is using several AI models developed in-house and by OpenAI for the agents. The company is also introducing ten ready-for-use agents that can help with routine tasks ranging from managing supply chain to expense tracking and client communications. In one demo, McKinsey & Co, which had early access to the tools, created an agent that can manage client inquires by checking interaction history, identifying the consultant for the task and scheduling a follow-up meeting. 'The idea is that Copilot [the company's chatbot] is the user interface for AI,' Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot at Microsoft, told Reuters. 'Every employee will have a Copilot, their personalized AI agent, and then they will use that Copilot to interface and interact with the sea of AI agents that will be out there.' Tech giants are facing investor pressure to show returns on their significant AI investments. Microsoft's shares fell 2.8% in the September quarter, underperforming the S&P 500, but remain more than 10% higher for the year. Some concerns have risen in recent months about the pace of Copilot adoption, with research firm Gartner saying in August its survey of 152 IT organizations showed that the vast majority had not progressed their Copilot initiatives past the pilot stage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/microsoft-to-allow-autonomous-ai-agent-development-starting-next-month/7829962.html	2024-10-21T03:07:48-07:00	
Sudanese army reports first defection of senior RSF commander	Sudan's army said on Sunday a commander from its foe the Rapid Support Forces had defected with some of his troops, the first such move by a senior figure since the two sides went to war more than 18 months ago. Supporters of the army posted photos online purporting to show Abuagla Keikal - a former army officer who became the RSF's top commander in the southeastern state of El Gezira - after he had defected. The RSF later published a statement alleging that Keikal had switched sides after a 'deal,' and saying that it had inflicted losses on the forces that defected with him in the east of El Gezira state, where Keikal is from. The army, which has recently reported gains against the RSF in parts of the capital, said Keikal had decided to make the move because of the RSF's 'destructive agenda.' There was no immediate comment from Keikal, who was a military intelligence officer before the war. The RSF has seized control of large parts of Sudan in a conflict with the army that the United Nations says has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. The war has displaced more than 10 million people, driven parts of the country to extreme hunger or famine, and drawn in foreign powers that have given both sides material support. It began in April 2023 when tensions between the RSF and the army, who had been jostling for position ahead of an internationally backed transition to civilian rule, erupted into open conflict. The army and the RSF had previously shared power after staging a coup in 2021, two years after veteran autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled in a popular uprising.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-army-reports-first-defection-of-senior-rsf-commander/7829945.html	2024-10-21T02:47:14-07:00	
Moldova's EU referendum goes to wire after Sandu decries vote meddling	CHISINAU, Moldova — A knife-edge majority of 50.17% voted 'yes' in Moldova's pivotal referendum on joining the European Union, nearly final results showed on Monday, after President Maia Sandu said Sunday's twin votes had been marred by 'unprecedented' outside interference. The tight finish - with fewer than 1.5% of the ballots still to be counted - is far from a resounding endorsement of the pro-EU path that Sandu has pursued over four years at the helm of the small ex-Soviet republic tugged between Russia and the West. A presidential election, which took place simultaneously, handed Sandu 42% of the vote while her main rival, former prosecutor-general Alexandr Stoianoglo won 26%, setting up a tightly fought run-off between the two on Nov. 3. The votes, which took place after a slew of allegations of election meddling, were seen as a test of the southeast European nation's commitment to join the European Union and escape Moscow's orbit for good. The tight referendum result puts Sandu in a weaker position going into the second round since she has championed EU integration. Moldova began the long process of formal accession talks in June and under Sandu has aimed to join by 2030. Ties with Moscow have deteriorated as Sandu condemned the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and diversified energy supply away from Russia. Stoianoglo has said that, if he comes to power, he would develop a 'balanced' foreign policy involving ties with the EU, Russia, United States and China. He boycotted Sunday's referendum, calling it a ruse to boost Sandu's haul at the election. 'Clear evidence' In the early hours of Monday, Sandu addressed Moldovan citizens, saying there was 'clear evidence' that criminal groups working together with 'foreign forces hostile to our national interests' had sought to buy off 300,000 votes. She said this amounted to 'fraud of unprecedented scale'. 'Criminal groups... have attacked our country with tens of millions of euros, lies and propaganda, using the most disgraceful means to keep our citizens and our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability,' she said. While still waiting for the final results, she said, Moldova would 'respond with firm decisions,' without elaborating. In the run-up to the vote, authorities made repeated statements alleging concerted attempts to meddle in the vote by fugitive tycoon Ilan Shor, who lives in Russia. Russia, which accuses Sandu's government of 'Russophobia,' denied interfering, while Shor denies wrongdoing. The police accused Shor, who was sentenced to jail in absentia for fraud and a role in the theft of $1 billion, of trying to pay off a network of at least 130,000 voters to vote 'no' and support 'our candidate' at the election. Shor has openly offered on social media to pay Moldovans to convince others to vote in a certain way and said that was a legitimate use of money that he earned. In the early hours of Monday, he declared Moldovans had voted against the referendum. 'Today I congratulate you; you lost the battle,' he added, addressing Sandu simply as Maia. Ahead of the vote, authorities took down online resources they said hosted disinformation, announced they had uncovered a program in Russia to train Moldovans to stage mass unrest and opened criminal cases against allies of Shor. As the early results came in late on Sunday, some 57% of Moldovans initially appeared to have voted 'no' in the referendum. As more ballots were counted, the 'yes' vote gradually rose, overtaking 'no' early on Monday morning. Political analyst Valeriu Pasha said the 'yes' vote had edged ahead only because of unusually high voter turnout among the Moldovan diaspora living abroad, who largely support EU integration. 'With such elections, in which dozens of (percentage points) can be bought, it will be very difficult for us going forward. But we must learn lessons and learn to fight this phenomenon,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7829934.html	2024-10-21T02:12:52-07:00	
Environmental delegates gather in Colombia for a conference on dwindling global biodiversity	Bogota, Colombia — Global environmental leaders gather Monday in Cali, Colombia to assess the world's plummeting biodiversity levels and commitments by countries to protect plants, animals and critical habitats. The two-week United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP16, is a follow-up to the 2022 Montreal meetings where 196 countries signed a historic global treaty to protect biodiversity. The accord includes 23 measures to halt and reverse nature loss, including putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030. In opening remarks on Sunday, Colombia's environment minister and COP16 president Susana Muhamad said the conference is an opportunity 'to collect the experience that has passed through this planet from all civilizations, from all cultures, from all knowledge ... to generate livable, relatively stable conditions for a new society that will be forged in the light of the crisis.' A real threat to biodiversity loss All evidence shows a dramatic decline in species abundance and distribution, said Linda Krueger, director of biodiversity at The Nature Conservancy. 'A lot of wild species have less room to live, and they're declining in numbers,' Krueger said. 'And we also see rising extinction rates. Things that we haven't even discovered yet are blinking out.' The world is experiencing its largest loss of life since the dinosaurs, with around 1 million plant and animal species now threatened with extinction, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. In the Amazon rainforest, threats to biodiversity include the expansion of the agricultural frontier and road networks, deforestation, forest fires and drought, says Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that protects the rainforest. 'You put all of that together and it's a real threat to biodiversity,' Miller said. Global wildlife populations have plunged on average by 73% in 50 years, according to the WWF and the Zoological Society of London biennial Living Planet report this month. The report said Latin America and the Caribbean saw 95% average declines in recorded wildlife populations. Indigenous communities key to biodiversity protection Indigenous people are on the front lines of protecting biodiversity and fighting against climate change, putting their lives at great risk, said Miller of Amazon Watch. 'A lot of discourse has been given about the voices of local communities … Indigenous peoples really playing a key role,' he said. 'So that's one of the things that we'll be looking for at COP16.' Indigenous peoples hold the solutions to combat the climate change and biodiversity crises, said Laura Rico, campaign director at Avaaz, a global activism nonprofit. 'They're who have been taking care of the land, healing the land through their governance systems, their care systems and their ways of life,' she said. 'So ... it's fundamental that the COP recognizes, promotes and encourages the legalization of their territories.' In Colombia's capital, Bogota, the head of an Amazon Indigenous organization said the region's Indigenous people have been preparing for months for COP16. 'This is a great opportunity to make the impact that we need to demonstrate to all the actors that come from other countries the importance of Indigenous peoples for the world,' said José Mendez, secretary of the National Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon. 'It's no secret to anyone that we ... are at risk right now,' he said. 'The effects that we are currently experiencing due to climate change, the droughts that the country is experiencing, the Amazon River has never gone through a drought like the current one. … This is causing many species to become extinct.' Nature can recover Environment minister Muhamad told local media this month that one of the conference's main objectives is to deliver the message that 'biodiversity is as important, complementary and indispensable as the energy transition and decarbonization.' Part of Colombia's first ever leftist government, Muhamad cautioned last year's World Economic Forum about the risks of continuing an extractive economy that ignores the social and environmental consequences of natural resource exploitation. Since the 2022 Montreal conference, 'progress has been too slow', says Eva Zabey, executive director of the coalition Business for Nature. 'There's been some progress,' she said. 'But the headline message is the implementation of the global biodiversity framework is too slow and we need to scale and speed up.' 'COP16 comes at an absolutely critical moment for us to move from targets setting to real actions on the ground,' Zabey said. Although biodiversity declines are grim, some environmentalists believe a reversal is possible. 'We've had some very successful species reintroductions and we've saved species when we really focus on what is causing their decline,' said The Nature Conservancy's Krueger.	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmental-delegates-gather-in-colombia-for-a-conference-on-dwindling-global-biodiversity/7829909.html	2024-10-21T00:49:45-07:00	
Gives us what you stole from us,' Australian senator yells at visiting King Charles	CANBERRA, Australia — An Indigenous senator told King Charles III that Australia is not his land and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the monarch is not needed as the country's head of state as the British royal visited Australia's parliament on Monday. Indigenous independent Senator Lidia Thorpe was escorted out of a parliamentary reception for the royal couple after shouting that British colonizers have taken Indigenous land and bones. 'You committed genocide against our people,' she shouted. 'Give us what you stole from us — our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty.' King Charles spoke quietly with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese while security officials stopped Senator Thorpe from approaching. 'This is not your land. You are not my king,' Thorpe yelled as she was ushered from the hall. Albanese, who wants the country to become a republic with an Australian head of state, also told the king it was time for his role to end. 'You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the Crown,' Albanese said. But, he said, 'nothing stands still.' Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who wants to keep the British king as Australia's monarch, noted that even supporters of a republic were honored to attend a reception for the Charles and Queen Camilla at Parliament House in the capital Canberra. 'People have had haircuts, people have shined shoes, suits have been pressed and that's just the republicans,' Dutton quipped. Australia's six state government leaders underscored the political divide on the country's constitutional relationship with Britain by declining invitations to attend the reception. All six would prefer an Australian citizen was Australia's head of state. They each said they had more pressing engagements on Monday, but monarchists agreed the royals had been snubbed. Charles used the start of his speech to thank Canberra Indigenous elder Auntie Violet Sheridan for her traditional welcome to the king and queen. 'Let me also say how deeply I appreciated this morning's moving Welcome to Country ceremony, which offers me the opportunity to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands on which we meet, the Ngunnawal people, and all First Nations peoples who have loved and cared for this continent for 65,000 years,' Charles said. 'Throughout my life, Australia's First Nations peoples have done me the great honor of sharing so generously their stories and cultures. I can only say how much my own experience has been shaped and strengthened by such traditional wisdom,' Charles added. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded to have been the consequence of disagreement about how a president would be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. Albanese has ruled out holding another referendum on the subject during his current three-year term in government. But it is a possibility if his center-left Labor Party is reelected at elections due by May next year. Charles was drawn into Australia's republic debate months before his visit. The Australian Republic Movement, which wants Australia to sever its constitutional ties with Britain, wrote to Charles in December last year requesting a meeting in Australia and for the king to advocate their cause. Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king's meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary. 'Whether Australia becomes a republic is ... a matter for the Australian public to decide,' the Buckingham Palace letter said. Earlier Monday, Charles and Camilla laid wreaths at the Australian War Memorial then shook hands with well-wishers on the second full day of their visit. The memorial estimated 4,000 people had turned out to see the couple. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which has led to a scaled-down itinerary. It is Charles' 17th trip to Australia and the first since he became king in 2022. It is the first visit to Australia by a reigning British monarch since his late mother Queen Elizabeth II traveled to the distant nation in 2011. Charles and Camilla rested the day after their arrival late Friday before making their first public appearance of the trip at a church service in Sydney on Sunday. They then flew to Canberra where they visited the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier and a reception at Parliament House. Before leaving the war memorial, they stopped to greet hundreds of people who gathered under clear skies flying Australian flags. On Wednesday, Charles will travel to Samoa, where he will open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gives-us-what-you-stole-from-us-australian-senator-yells-at-visiting-king-charles/7829907.html	2024-10-21T00:46:20-07:00	
Cuba grid collapses again raising doubts about a quick fix	HAVANA — Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, raising fresh doubts about a quick fix on an island already suffering from severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine. The blackout, after weeks of rolling outages, sparked some small protests around the Caribbean island, where a tropical storm threatened to hamper efforts to restore power. Cuba's national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos and leaving around 10 million people in the dark. The grid has collapsed three times since, underscoring the precarious state of the country's infrastructure. The repeated failures mark a major setback in the government's efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents, a majority of which have already suffered from months of blackouts through the Caribbean`s sultry summer. Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared Sunday evening on national television dressed in olive drab military attire, encouraging Cubans to air their grievances over the situation with discipline and civility. 'We are not going to accept nor allow anyone to act with vandalism and much less to alter the tranquility of our people,' said Diaz-Canel, who is rarely seen in uniform. The capital Havana was entirely blacked out on Sunday evening, with only scattered businesses, bars and homes running on small fuel-fired generators. Most of the city of 2 million was quiet. Residents played dominoes on the sidewalk, listened to music on battery-powered radios and sat on doorsteps. A heavy police presence was visible at points throughout the city. Reuters journalists witnessed several 'cacerolazos' - pot-banging protests common in Latin America - in neighborhoods on the outskirts of Havana. Protesters angry over shortages of food, water and electricity blocked roads with trash heaps in San Miguel de Padron, a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the city before being dispersed by security forces. Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy said on Sunday he recognized the blackouts were bothersome to residents, but said most Cubans understood and supported government efforts to restore power. 'It is Cuban culture to cooperate,' O Levy told reporters on Sunday. 'Those isolated and minimal incidents that do exist, we catalog them as incorrect, as indecent.' Earlier on Sunday, Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid's Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope. The day took a turn for the worse late in the afternoon, however, when another total grid collapse forced authorities to start again from scratch, raising the specter of a several more days of widespread outages. Officials initially said power would be restored by Monday or Tuesday. It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government's efforts. Those efforts were also hampered by Tropical Storm Oscar, which made landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba. The Communist-run government canceled school through Wednesday - a near unprecedented move in Cuba - citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday. Rising tensions Housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighborhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power. 'My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste,' she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home. Others complained they had not received water since blackouts began. Internet traffic dropped off sharply in Cuba over the weekend, according to data from internet monitoring group NetBlocks, as vast power outages made it all but impossible for most island residents to charge phones and get online. The government has blamed weeks of worsening blackouts - as long as 10 to 20 hours a day across much of the island - on deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand. Cuba also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as sanctions instituted by then-President Donald Trump, for ongoing difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate and maintain its oil-fired plants. The U.S. has denied any role in the grid failures. Cuba depends on imports to feed its largely obsolete, oil-fired power plants. Fuel deliveries to the island have dropped significantly this year as Venezuela, Russia and Mexico, once important suppliers, have slashed their exports to Cuba. Ally Venezuela - struggling to supply its own market - cut by half its deliveries of subsidized fuel to Cuba this year, forcing the island to search for more costly oil on the spot market. Mexico, another frequent supplier, appeared also to have cut fuel flows to Cuba during a presidential election year. Recently elected President Claudia Sheinbaum has not said if the state-supported supply to Cuba will continue under same terms under her administration.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-grid-collapses-again-raising-doubts-about-a-quick-fix/7829902.html	2024-10-21T00:28:27-07:00	
New Zealand, Cambodia cite political risks due to high energy transition costs	SINGAPORE — Political risks due to potential loss of public support over rising power tariffs are a major impediment to transitioning to cleaner electricity sources, ministers from New Zealand and Cambodia told an energy industry event on Monday. 'It's incredibly important to take the public with you, given that end of the day, they have to believe that what you're doing is enhancing their lives,' Shane Jones, Associate Minister for Energy, New Zealand, said at the Singapore International Energy Week conference. Jones said New Zealand's power tariffs are comparable to Singapore's, ranking among the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. 'If the public feel that they can't see the upside of the medium- to long-term climate-positive outcomes, and they're suffering disproportionately on the journey, it leads to political mayhem,' Jones said. Cambodia's energy minister, Keo Rottanak, said the transition in Southeast Asia towards net zero would be costly and take a long time. 'If we don't bring costs down, we may lose the public support, and therefore it will just make the whole thing go away,' he said. At the same event, Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil-producing company, cited limitations of current transition plans. 'In a transition that requires staggering amounts of front-end capital investment, the cost of capital is more than twice as high in developing countries where the need is greater,' he said. 'Let us be clear: all sources of energy will be required for decades to come. Planners must also abandon the belief that a single plan can meet the needs of more than 200 countries,' he said. The transition 'would be expensive for everyone,' he said. Nasser said existing plans have not even been able to reduce demand for carbon-intensive coal. 'Trying to force an unworkable, unaffordable transition plan on them will only threaten their economic progress and even social cohesion,' he said, referring to the global South.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-cambodia-cite-political-risks-due-to-high-energy-transition-costs/7829886.html	2024-10-20T23:53:39-07:00	
Indonesia's Prabowo plans military academy retreat for new cabinet	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia's new President Prabowo Subianto will take his cabinet members on a three-day retreat at a military academy nestled in a Javanese mountain range, where they will sleep in tents, an unusual start for a government in the Southeast Asian country. Former special force commander Prabowo was sworn in as Indonesia's eighth president on Sunday, taking over from Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo to lead the world's third-biggest democracy. He announced his cabinet on Sunday evening and his ministers were to be inaugurated later on Monday. First on the agenda will be the retreat this weekend at a military academy in Magelang, Central Java, surrounded by volcanoes about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Jakarta. The retreat is aimed at forming a bond between around 100 cabinet ministers and their deputies, a diverse grouping of politicians, technocrats, former military officials and religious leaders, according to Abdul Kadir Karding, migrant protection minister. Prabowo wants to make sure his cabinet members understand his vision, Karding said. 'So it will be easier for us to work together. (Prabowo) always emphasizes the importance of solidity,' Karding said, noting that an anti-corruption lesson will be part of the material covered at the retreat. All the ministers will be expected to sleep in tents, he also said. Cooperatives minister, Budi Arie Setiadi, 55, said the retreat will be held Friday through Sunday, Oct. 25-27. Such an excursion is not new for Prabowo and reflects his leadership style. His Gerindra political party has often organized similar events at Prabowo's spacious Hambalang estate south of Jakarta. Gerindra's most recent retreat was held in September to prepare elected parliamentary members to be sworn in. Social media posts from the retreat show politicians posing for photographs wearing brown camouflage uniforms, maroon berets and combat boots. Most Gerindra retreats have consisted of briefings on state ideology and leadership, and outdoor activities such as jogging and light exercises, said 57-year-old Gerindra member Ferry Juliantono, who is Prabowo's deputy minister of cooperatives. He said Prabowo, 73, himself typically leads the retreats. Prabowo's cabinet includes officials continuing on from the administration of predecessor Joko Widodo, such as highly-regarded finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, 62, as well as retired Lt Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, 71, a friend of Prabowo since their military days who is now defense minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-prabowo-plans-military-academy-retreat-for-new-cabinet/7829882.html	2024-10-20T23:39:50-07:00	
Russian drone attack damages Kyiv residential buildings	Russian drone attacks injured at least one person in Ukraine’s capital, officials in Kyiv said Monday. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram falling debris from drones shot down by Ukrainian air defenses damaged several residential buildings. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram that as many as a dozen Russian drones were involved in the attack, but that all of them were destroyed. Russian drones also targeted Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine. Governor Vitalii Kim said Monday on Telegram that air defenses downed three drones overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Monday it destroyed 18 Ukrainian drones launched in overnight attacks. Eleven of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, while another four were destroyed over Bryansk, two over Kursk and one over Oryol. Officials in Kursk reported there were no casualties and no damage reported from the attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-damages-kyiv-residential-buildings/7829856.html	2024-10-20T21:54:44-07:00

Catholic priest, Indigenous activist Pérez killed by gunmen in southern Mexico	TAPACHULA, Mexico — Catholic priest Marcelo Perez, an activist for Indigenous peoples and farm laborers in southern Mexico, was killed on Sunday. The prosecutors' office in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, in the state of Chiapas, said the religious leader was shot dead by two gunmen when he was in his van. Perez was a member of the Tzotzil Indigenous people and had just finished serving a Mass when he was attacked. He served the community for two decades and was known as a negotiator in conflicts in a mountainous region of Chiapas where crime, violence and land disputes are rife. Perez also led several marches against violence, which has brought him several death threats. Chipas Gov. Rutilio Escandon posted on X that he condemned 'the cowardly assassination of father Marcelo Perez. 'We will collaborate with all the authorities so his death doesn't go unpunished and those guilty face the courts,' Escandon said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-priest-indigenous-activist-p%c3%a9rez-killed-by-gunmen-in-southern-mexico/7829817.html	2024-10-20T18:38:02-07:00	
Thelma Mothershed Wair, member of Little Rock Nine who integrated Arkansas school, has died	Thelma Mothershed Wair, one of the nine Black students who integrated a high school in Arkansas' capital city of Little Rock in 1957 while a mob of white segregationists yelled threats and insults, has died at age 83. Mothershed Wair died Saturday at a hospital in Little Rock after having complications from multiple sclerosis, her sister, Grace Davis, confirmed Sunday to The Associated Press. The students who integrated Central High School were known as the Little Rock Nine. For three weeks in September 1957, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus used the National Guard to block the Black students from enrolling in Central High, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court declared segregated classrooms were unconstitutional. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent members of the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort the students into school on Sept. 25, 1957. Davis said she was enrolled at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville when her sister and the other students — Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls — integrated Central High School. 'I didn't think anybody was really going to hurt her because, you know, we've had racial incidents in Little Rock over the years,' Davis said of her sister. 'People would say things that were mean, but they never really hurt anybody.' Davis said in the years that followed she and her sister spoke about the experience. 'I think one time somebody put some ink on her skirt or something when she was coming through the hallway. And, of course, there was always name-calling,' Davis said. 'But she never really had any physical confrontations with any of the students up there.' Faubus closed all of the schools in Little Rock in 1958 to try to avoid further integration. Mothershed went out of state to finish her remaining high school classes. The academic credits transferred back to Little Rock, and she ultimately earned her diploma from Central High School. 'She was always a fighter,' Davis said of her sister. 'She's been sick her entire life. She was born with a congenital heart defect and was told at an early age that she would never get out of her teens. So as she approached her 16th birthday, I remember Mother talking about how afraid she was because she thought she was going to die. But she did what she wanted to do. She enjoyed life.' Mothershed earned a bachelor's degree in home economics education from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and a master's degree in guidance and counseling from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Mothershed married Fred Wair in 1965. The couple have one son, Scott; two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 2005, and Mothershed Wair moved back to Little Rock, Davis said. According to the National Park Service, Mothershed Wair worked in the East St. Louis, Illinois, school system for 10 years as a home economics teacher and for 18 years as a counselor for elementary career education before retiring in 1994. She also worked at the Juvenile Detention Center of the St. Clair County Jail in Illinois, and was an instructor of survival skills for women at the American Red Cross. Each member of the Little Rock Nine was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, and they donated them to the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum in Little Rock in 2011.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thelma-mothershed-wair-member-of-little-rock-nine-who-integrated-arkansas-school-has-died/7829813.html	2024-10-20T18:26:34-07:00	
Expelled Indian high commissioner denies involvement in murder of Sikh leader in Canada	VANCOUVER, British Columbia — India's high commissioner to Canada has denied any involvement in the murder of a Canadian Sikh leader who was killed in British Columbia last year even though the Canadian government has named him as a person of interest in the assassination. Sanjay Kumar Verma, who was expelled last Monday along with five other Indian diplomats, said in an interview on CTV's Question Period Sunday that the allegations are politically motivated. 'Nothing at all,' Verma said when asked if he had any role in in the shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar who was killed outside a cultural center in Surrey, British Columbia on June 18, 2023. 'No evidence presented. Politically motivated.' Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Nijjar's murder and are awaiting trial. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police went public with allegations that Indian diplomats were targeting Sikh separatists in Canada by sharing information about them with their government back home. They said top Indian officials were then passing that information to Indian organized crime groups who were targeting the activists, who are Canadian citizens, with drive-by shootings, extortions and even murder. Verma denied the Indian government was targeting Sikh separatists in Canada. 'I, as high commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind,' he said. Any action taken by Indian officials in Canada was 'overt,' said Verma. In the interview Verma condemned Nijjar's death. 'Any murder is wrong and bad,' he said. 'I do condemn.' Verma also pushed back on comments made by Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly that compared India to Russia. She said Canada's national police force has linked Indian diplomats to homicides, death threats and intimidation in Canada. 'Let me see the concrete evidence she's talking about,' said Verma. 'As far as I'm concerned, she's talking politically.' India has rejected the Canadian accusations as absurd, and its foreign ministry said it was expelling Canada's acting high commissioner and five other diplomats in response. Verma said 'not a shred of evidence has been shared with us' about the Canadian allegations. The RCMP has said attempts earlier this month to share evidence with Indian officials were unsuccessful. Verma said the RCMP had not applied for the proper visas to visit India. 'A visa needs to be affixed,' he said. 'For any government delegation to travel to another country, you need an agenda to go by. There was no agenda at all.' Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against an Indian government employee Thursday in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. In the case announced by the Justice Department, Vikash Yadav, who authorities say directed the New York plot from India, faces murder-for-hire charges in a planned killing that prosecutors have previously said was meant to precede a string of other politically motivated murders in the United States and Canada. 'An indictment is not a conviction,' Verma said. 'It will follow its judicial process.' India has repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for being soft on supporters of what is known as the Khalistan movement, which is banned in India but has support among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in Canada. The Khalistan movement supports the establishment of an independent Sikh state in India. The Nijjar killing in Canada has soured India-Canada ties for more than a year, but Verma doesn't expect this will impact business relations between the two countries. 'I don't see much impact on non-political bilateral relations,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/expelled-indian-high-commissioner-denies-involvement-in-murder-of-sikh-leader-in-canada/7829792.html	2024-10-20T17:10:07-07:00	
US, Canadian navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait week after China war games	Taipei, Taiwan — A U.S. and a Canadian warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait together Sunday less than a week after China conducted a new round of war games around the island, with Beijing denouncing the mission as 'disruptive.' The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied countries, transits the strait around once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, also says the strategic waterway belongs to it. The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said Monday that the destroyer USS Higgins and the Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver made a 'routine' transit Sunday 'through waters where high-seas freedom of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law.' The transit demonstrated the United States' and Canada's commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all countries, it said in a statement. 'The international community's navigational rights and freedoms in the Taiwan Strait should not be limited. The United States rejects any assertion of sovereignty or jurisdiction that is inconsistent with freedoms of navigations, overflight, and other lawful uses of the sea and air,' it said. China's Eastern Theater Command said its forces monitored and warned the ships. 'The actions of the United States and Canada caused trouble and are disruptive to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,' it added. China staged war-games last Monday it said were a warning to 'separatist acts' and which drew condemnation from the Taiwanese and U.S. governments. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims saying only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-canadian-navy-ships-sail-through-taiwan-strait-week-after-china-war-games/7829524.html	2024-10-20T16:49:52-07:00	
Lebanese media say Israeli strikes hit Hezbollah-linked finance group	Beirut — Lebanese state media reported Israeli strikes Sunday on branches of a Hezbollah-linked financial association, including near the country's only airport, after the Israeli military warned it would attack Al-Qard Al-Hassan's branches. The strikes mark an expansion of the Israeli campaign against Iran-backed group Hezbollah after a year of cross-border exchanges that escalated in late September into a full-blown war. Lebanon's official National News Agency (NNA) reported 11 strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs, many of them targeting Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which Israel says is financing Hezbollah's operations against Israel. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops Sunday that the military was stepping up its strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, 'destroying them in places that Hezbollah planned to use as launchpads for attacks against Israel.' The IDF warned it was about to attack offices of Al-Qard Al-Hassan and urged residents to move away from its facilities. Soon after the Israeli warning, several blasts were heard, and a large fire was seen in Beirut's southern suburbs. There was no immediate information on the explosions, or details of any casualties. Panicked crowds clogged the streets and caused traffic jams in some parts of Beirut as they tried to get to neighborhoods thought to be safer, witnesses said. 'Residents of Lebanon, the IDF (Israeli military) will begin attacking infrastructure belonging to the Hezbollah Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association — get away from it immediately,' the Israeli military's spokesperson said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. According to NNA, a strike landed near Beirut's airport, the main entry-point of humanitarian assistance to the country and a major evacuation hub for those fleeing the conflict. Commercial planes were still seen flying past clouds of smoke over the embattled southern suburbs, said an AFP correspondent, who watched them land at Beirut's airport, located near targeted areas. AFP footage showed a column of smoke rising near one of the airports runways, as well as over nearby areas in Beirut's southern suburbs, hit hard by the nearly monthlong war. In the suburbs of Chiyah, the strikes flattened an entire building, AFP footage showed. Excavators worked to clear the rubble, as rescuers scoured for survivors. The building housed a branch of Al-Qard Al-Hassan, according to an AFP correspondent. NNA also reported strikes targeting the association in Hermel, Riyaq and Baalbek in the Beqaa Valley region in Lebanon's east. The strike on Baalbek hit a commercial market housing a building formerly used by Al-Qard Al-Hassan, NNA said. An AFP correspondent said residents quickly evacuated the area after the Israeli army issued a warning. In southern Lebanon, Israeli strikes hit branches near the cities of Sidon and Nabatieh, according to NNA. Panic, evacuations The strikes came after the Israeli army said it would attack the association's branches in Beirut, the Beqaa and southern Lebanon, issuing evacuation warnings for more than a dozen buildings in the capital Beirut alone. An AFP correspondent in Lebanon's coastal city of Sidon said the Israeli announcement triggered panic among displaced people sheltering near a branch of Al-Qard Al-Hassan. Many rushed out of the school-turned-shelter, heading on foot toward the seafront or other areas of the city, the correspondent said. Sidon's mayor ordered the evacuation of the city's municipality and two shelters housing the displaced, according to NNA. Rescuers and paramedics, including firefighting teams, were instructed to 'be on alert in anticipation of any emergency,' NNA quoted him as saying. 'We will remain prepared to face all possibilities, and we ask God to protect our city and Lebanon.' The U.S.-sanctioned Al-Qard Al-Hassan is a financial association the U.S. Treasury says has been used by Hezbollah as a cover to mask financial activities and to gain access to the international financial system. Asked by journalists whether the branches could be considered military targets, a senior Israeli intelligence official said: 'The purpose of this strike is to target the ability of Hezbollah economic function both during the war but also afterwards to rebuild and to rearm ...on the day after.' A senior Israeli intelligence official described the firm as an integral component to Hezbollah's financial network that helps fund its operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanese-media-say-israeli-strikes-hit-hezbollah-linked-finance-group/7829515.html	2024-10-20T16:29:56-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy seeks strong reaction to North Korean involvement in war	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday he was seeking a strong reaction from countries who have acknowledged that North Korea is becoming more involved in Russia's more than 2-1/2-year-old war against Ukraine. Speaking in his nightly video address, Zelenskyy said there was ample satellite and video evidence that North Korea was sending not only equipment to Russia, but also soldiers to be prepared for deployment. 'I am grateful to those leaders and representatives of states who do not close their eyes and speak frankly about this cooperation for the sake of a larger war,' he said. 'We expect a normal, honest, strong reaction from our partners on this.' Zelenskyy said greater North Korean involvement could only be harmful to everyone. 'Unfortunately, instability and threats can significantly increase after North Korea becomes trained for modern warfare,' he said. 'If the world remains silent now and we have to engage soldiers from North Korea on the front line in the same way we have to defend ourselves from (Iranian) Shahed drones, this will certainly benefit no one in the world and only prolong the war.' North Korea's actions, he said, meant 'in effect yet another country entering the war against Ukraine.' Zelenskyy last week accused North Korea of deploying officers alongside Russia and preparing to send thousands of troops to help Moscow's war effort. South Korea's spy agency said on Friday North Korea had dispatched 1,500 special forces troops to Russia's Far East for training. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday he could not confirm reports that North Korea has sent troops to Russia ahead of a possible deployment, but said such a move would be concerning, if true. NATO chief Mark Rutte said on Thursday there was no evidence of Pyongyang's presence at this stage. The involvement of North Korean regular troops to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine would be a serious escalation of the war, France and Ukraine's foreign ministers said at a joint press conference in Kyiv on Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-seeks-strong-reaction-to-north-korean-involvement-in-war/7829506.html	2024-10-20T15:33:36-07:00	
Brazil's Lula cancels Russia trip for BRICS summit after head injury	Brasilia, Brazil — Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday canceled his trip to Russia for the BRICS summit, following medical advice to temporarily avoid long-haul flights after hurting his head in an accident at home. In a statement, the presidential office said Lula, 78, will now participate in the BRICS meeting via videoconference. He was initially scheduled to depart at 5 p.m. on Sunday. According to a medical report issued by the Sirio Libanes Hospital in Brasilia, Lula suffered a laceration to the 'occipital region' in the back of his head on Saturday. The report said Lula 'was advised to avoid long-distance air travel but is otherwise able to carry out his regular duties.' The government said in a post on X that Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira has been designated to lead the Brazilian delegation in the BRICS summit, departing later on Sunday. The diplomatic forum founded 15 years ago by major emerging markets Brazil, Russia, India, China has since expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Congresswoman Gleisi Hoffmann, president of Lula's Workers Party, posted on social media that she had spoken with the president and that 'he is doing very well, just avoiding a long trip.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-cancels-russia-trip-for-brics-summit-after-head-injury/7829504.html	2024-10-20T15:19:50-07:00	
2 US Navy aviators declared dead after fighter jet crashed in Washington state	Mount Rainier National Park, Washington — Two crew members who were missing following the crash of a fighter jet in mountainous terrain in Washington during a routine training flight have been declared dead, the U.S. Navy said Sunday. The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed east of Mount Rainier on Tuesday afternoon, according to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S helicopter, immediately launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find the crew and crash site. Army Special Forces soldiers trained in mountaineering, high-angle rescue and technical communications were brought in to reach the wreckage, which was located Wednesday by an aerial crew resting at about 1,828 meters (6,000 feet) in a remote, steep and heavily wooded area east of Mount Rainier, officials said. Locating the missing crew members 'as quickly and as safely as possible' had been their priority, Capt. David Ganci, commander, Electronic Attack Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet, said Thursday. The aviators' names won’t be released until a day after their next of kin have been notified, the Navy wrote in a press release Sunday, adding that search and rescue efforts have shifted into a long-term salvage and recovery operation as the cause of the crash is still being investigated. 'It is with a heavy heart that we share the loss of two beloved Zappers,' said Cmdr. Timothy Warburton, commanding officer of the aviators’ Electronic Attack Squadron, in the press release. 'Our priority right now is taking care of the families of our fallen aviators. ... We are grateful for the ongoing teamwork to safely recover the deceased.' Ganci said they could not identify the missing crew until 24 hours after their families had been notified of their status. The crash remains under investigation. The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. The 'Zappers' were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The search took place near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round. The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island in 2008. In the past 15 years, the Growler has operated around the globe supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in front and an electronics operator behind them. 'The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy’s first line of defense in hostile environments,' the Navy said on its website. Each aircraft costs about $67 million. Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths. In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in crashed off the coast of Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-aviators-declared-dead-after-fighter-jet-crashed-in-washington-state/7829462.html	2024-10-20T13:12:23-07:00	
One of the last Navajo Code Talkers from World War II dies at 107	WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. — John Kinsel Sr., one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages during World War II based on the tribe's native language, has died. He was 107. Navajo Nation officials in Window Rock announced Kinsel's death on Saturday. Tribal President Buu Nygren has ordered all flags on the reservation to be flown at half-staff until Oct. 27 at sunset to honor Kinsel. 'Mr. Kinsel was a Marine who bravely and selflessly fought for all of us in the most terrifying circumstances with the greatest responsibility as a Navajo Code Talker,' Nygren said in a statement Sunday. With Kinsel's death, only two original Navajo Code Talkers are still alive: Former Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and Thomas H. Begay. Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war, transmitting messages based on their then-unwritten native language. They confounded Japanese military cryptologists during World War II and participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, including at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. The Code Talkers sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war's ultimate outcome. Kinsel was born in Cove, Arizona, and lived in the Navajo community of Lukachukai. He enlisted in the Marines in 1942 and became an elite Code Talker, serving with the 9th Marine Regiment and the 3rd Marine Division during the Battle of Iwo Jima. President Ronald Reagan established Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982 and the Aug. 14 holiday honors all the tribes associated with the war effort. The day is an Arizona state holiday and Navajo Nation holiday on the vast reservation that occupies portions of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-the-last-navajo-code-talkers-from-world-war-ii-dies-at-107/7829469.html	2024-10-20T13:09:21-07:00	
Serbia's president talks with Putin and vows he'll never impose sanctions on Russia	BELGRADE — European Union candidate Serbia will continue to refuse to impose sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine despite Western pressure, Serbia's leader said after his telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday. Populist Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Instagram that he believes the call, what he said was his first in more than two years with the Russian president, will help 'further development of relations and trust between Russia and Serbia.' 'We talked as people who have known each other for a long time, as friends, and the ten-minute conversation was marked by a personal note, and we also talked about those who are weak [pro-Western] leaders,' Vucic said. He did not say whether he would accept an earlier invitation by Putin to attend a BRICS summit of emerging economies, led by Russia and China, in Kazan later this week. Although formally seeking E.U. membership, traditional Russian Slavic ally Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine though it has reluctantly condemned Moscow's aggression. Vucic has said that imposing the sanctions wasn't in Serbia's national interest. He said Sunday he expects criticism from the West of his conversation with Putin, but stated that 'Serbia is a sovereign country which makes its own decisions.' He also thanked Russia 'for providing sufficient quantities of gas for Serbia at favorable prices.' Serbia was almost completely dependent on the Russian gas but has recently agreed to start to diversify its supplies. Serbia, which was never part of the Soviet bloc, on Sunday marked the 80th anniversary of the liberation of its capital Belgrade from the Nazi World War II occupation, which was accomplished mostly thanks to former Yugoslavia's communist partisans, but also the Soviet Red Army. Belgrade's nationalist authorities marked the liberation date with a display of the pro-Russian sentiment, with thousands marching through Belgrade waving Russian flags and chanting slogans. At a meeting marking the anniversary, Vucic delivered a speech in the Russian language, which he said is a sign of respect for the Red Army, without which 'there would not have been the liberation of Belgrade.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-s-president-talks-with-putin-and-vows-he-ll-never-impose-sanctions-on-russia/7829406.html	2024-10-20T10:46:47-07:00	
Iran protests EU support for UAE over disputed islands	Tehran — Iran summoned the ambassador of Hungary, whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency, to protest a joint E.U.-Gulf Cooperation Council statement on islands controlled by Iran but claimed by the UAE, state media reported Sunday. The statement, published after the first summit between the two regional blocs on Wednesday, said, 'We call on Iran to end its occupation of the three islands of the United Arab Emirates, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which constitutes a violation of the sovereignty of the UAE and the principles of the Charter of the U.N.' The islands located near the Strait of Hormuz, a globally vital shipping lane, have been disputed between the United Arab Emirates and Iran for decades. Tehran has controlled the islands since 1971 at the end of British imperial rule over them. 'The Hungarian ambassador was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry to protest against the repetition of certain baseless claims in the joint declaration from the leaders of the EU and the GCC,' the official IRNA news agency reported. The foreign ministry called the EU's stance 'thoughtless, irresponsible and void of any legal basis,' IRNA added. On Monday, the European Union accused Tehran of supplying missiles and drones to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine and imposed fresh sanctions on the country. In April 2023, Iran appointed an ambassador to the UAE for the first time in nearly eight years as part of improving diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-protests-eu-support-for-uae-over-disputed-islands-/7829391.html	2024-10-20T10:30:30-07:00	
Tens of thousands rally in Georgia for EU ahead of pivotal vote	Tbilisi — Tens of thousands of Georgians staged on Sunday a pro-Europe rally, days before parliamentary elections seen as a crucial test for the country's democracy and its bid for EU membership. Saturday's vote will pit an unprecedented alliance of pro-Western opposition forces against the ruling Georgian Dream party, accused by Brussels of shifting towards authoritarianism and derailing EU candidate Tbilisi from its European path. Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili — at loggerheads with the government — said she will join the rally, which 'will demonstrate people's will for freedom, independence, and a European future.' Tens of thousands of demonstrators, waving EU and Georgian flags and holding banners that read 'Georgia chooses the European Union' gathered at Tbilisi's central Freedom Square after marching toward the venue from five different locations, AFP journalists on the scene reported. Several Georgian NGOs, including Georgia's European Orbit and the 'My Voice to the EU' coalition, called on Georgians to stage there a mass rally from 7:00 pm (1500 GMT). 'Choosing unity, development, and the European Union, Georgians will rally on October 20 (Sunday) and show their resolve to pursue the path of EU membership,' organizers said on Facebook. Brussels froze Georgia's EU accession process after Georgian Dream lawmakers this spring passed a controversial 'foreign influence law' targeting civil society. The adoption of the measure — criticized as a Kremlin-style law to silence dissent — sparked weeks of mass street protests and also prompted Washington to impose sanctions on dozens of Georgian officials. Earlier this month, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned that Georgian Dream's actions 'signal a shift towards authoritarianism.' He called the upcoming polls 'a crucial test for democracy in Georgia and its European Union path.' Opinion polls suggest opposition parties are likely to garner enough votes in Saturday's election to form a coalition government and replace the ruling party, controlled by powerful billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. Analysts have warned of the risk of turmoil if Georgian Dream attempts to hold onto power regardless of the vote's outcome. In power since 2012, the party initially pursued a liberal pro-Western policy agenda, but over the last two years has reversed course and been accused of moving closer to Moscow amid its invasion of Ukraine. Bids for membership of the EU and NATO are enshrined in Georgia's constitution and supported by some 80 percent of the population, according to multiple opinion polls commissioned by groups including the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-georgia-for-eu-ahead-of-pivotal-vote-/7829381.html	2024-10-20T09:56:38-07:00	
US writer Anne Applebaum calls for arms for Ukraine, accepts German peace prize	WARSAW, Poland — The prominent American journalist and historian Anne Applebaum urged continued support for Ukraine as she accepted a prestigious German prize Sunday, arguing that pacifism in the face of aggression is often nothing more than appeasement. Applebaum made her appeal to an audience in Frankfurt, where she was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. She was joined by her husband, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who like his wife is a strong voice on the international stage for supporting Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's brutal invasion. 'If there is even a small chance that military defeat could help end this horrific cult of violence in Russia, just as military defeat once brought an end to the cult of violence in Germany, we should take it,' Applebaum said. Many Germans have embraced an ethos of pacifism because of their nation's aggression under Adolf Hitler during World War II. And many have misgivings now about supplying weapons to Kyiv, fearing Russia and worried that it could cause the war to spread beyond Ukraine's borders to the rest of Europe. 'Some even call for peace by referring solemnly to the ‘lessons of German history,' Applebaum noted, according to a transcript of her speech published by the prize organization. 'As I am here today accepting a peace prize, this seems the right moment to point out that ‘I want peace’ is not always a moral argument,' Applebaum said. 'This is also the right moment to say that the lesson of German history is not that Germans should be pacifists.' 'On the contrary, we have known for nearly a century that a demand for pacifism in the face of an aggressive, advancing dictatorship can simply represent the appeasement and acceptance of that dictatorship.' She argued that the 'real lesson' from German history should be that Germans 'have a special responsibility to stand up for freedom and to take risks in doing so.' The prize, which is endowed with $27,185, was awarded in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt — which is considered the birthplace of German parliamentary democracy — at the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair. The prize has been awarded since 1950. It honors individuals who have contributed to turning the idea of peace into reality through literature, science or art. Last year’s prize was awarded to British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie for his perseverance despite enduring decades of threats and violence. The German news agency dpa reported that Applebaum's strong support for continuing to arm Ukraine triggered some criticism, citing Karin Schmidt-Friderichs, the head of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, which awards the prize. Nonetheless she received strong applause for her speech, dpa reported from Frankfurt. Following pacifism to its logical conclusion, Applebaum argued, would 'mean that we should acquiesce to the military conquest of Ukraine, to the cultural destruction of Ukraine, to the construction of concentration camps in Ukraine, to the kidnapping of children in Ukraine.' Applebaum writes for The Atlantic magazine. She has written books that focus on totalitarianism in Eastern Europe, including 'The Gulag,' and 'The Iron Curtain' and 'Red Famine,' about dictator Joseph Stalin's war on Ukraine. She recently published 'Autocracy, Inc. The Dictators Who Want to Run the World.' In 2004, she was awarded the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. The prize jury said Applebaum’s analyses of communist and post-communist systems in the Soviet Union and Russia reveal 'the mechanisms by which authoritarians grab hold of power and maintain their control.' The laudation for Applebaum was delivered by the Russian historian Irina Scherbakova, a founding member of the human rights organization Memorial, which is now banned in Russia and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-writer-anne-applebaum-calls-for-arms-for-ukraine-accepts-german-peace-prize-/7829375.html	2024-10-20T09:41:34-07:00	
WHO urges Rwanda to see off Marburg outbreak	Geneva — The WHO chief on Sunday urged Rwanda to keep up its fightback against Marburg, as the country battles an outbreak of one of the world's deadliest viruses. There have been 62 confirmed cases and 15 deaths in the outbreak, which was first announced in late September. No new cases have been detected in the last six days and 44 people have recovered from infection. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, visited Rwanda to see the outbreak response for himself and hailed the country's handling of the situation. 'We're pleased to see that there have been no new cases in the past six days, and we hope that remains the case,' he told a press conference in the capital Kigali. 'But we are dealing with one of the world's most dangerous viruses, and continued vigilance is essential. 'Enhanced surveillance, contact tracing and infection prevention and control measures must continue at scale until the outbreak is declared over.' Such a declaration can only be made after 42 days -- two consecutive incubation periods — without a new confirmed case. Marburg is transmitted to humans from fruit bats, and is part of the filovirus family that includes Ebola. With a fatality rate of up to 88 percent, Marburg's highly infectious hemorrhagic fever is often accompanied by bleeding and organ failure. However, the case fatality rate in this outbreak has been held down at 24 percent. On Saturday, Tedros visited the treatment center where the remaining patients are being looked after. 'Two of the patients we met had experienced all of the symptoms of Marburg, including multiple organ failure, but they were put on life support, they were successfully intubated and extubated, and are now recovering,' he said. 'We believe this is the first time patients with Marburg virus have been extubated in Africa. These patients would have died in previous outbreaks.' There are currently no officially approved vaccines nor approved antiviral treatments, but potential treatments, including blood products, immune and drug therapies are being evaluated. A vaccination program using a trial vaccine was launched in Rwanda earlier this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-urges-rwanda-to-see-off-marburg-outbreak/7829344.html	2024-10-20T08:59:01-07:00	
Israel to take legal action against Macron over naval trade show ban	Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday he had ordered his ministry to start legal proceedings against French President Emmanuel Macron after Paris banned Israeli firms from participating in an upcoming military naval trade show. The decision to bar Israeli firms is the latest incident in a row fueled by the Macron government's unease over Israel's conduct in the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Euronaval, organizer of the Nov. 4-7 event in Paris, said in a statement last week that the French government had informed it that Israeli delegations were not allowed to exhibit stands or show equipment, but could attend the trade show. The decision affected seven firms, it said. 'I have instructed the Foreign Ministry to take legal and diplomatic action against French President ... decision to prevent Israeli companies from showcasing their products at the @SalonEuronaval exhibition in Paris next month,' Katz said in a statement on social platform X. 'The boycott of Israeli companies for the second time, or the imposition of unacceptable conditions, are undemocratic measures that are not acceptable between friendly nations. I urge President Macron to cancel them entirely.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-take-legal-action-against-macron-over-naval-trade-show-ban/7829303.html	2024-10-20T07:53:43-07:00	
Thousands join right-wing rally against Spanish government	Madrid — Thousands of people packed a Madrid square on Sunday to protest against Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government and demand an early election, at a rally backed by right-wing parties. Waving red and yellow Spanish flags, protesters massed in the Plaza de Castilla, a large square in the heart of Madrid's financial district and called on Sanchez to resign, shouting 'traitor.' More than 100 little-known, small groups linked to the right and far-right called the rally under the slogan 'For unity, dignity, the law and freedom. General elections now!' The demonstration was supported by the main opposition conservative Popular Party (PP) and the extreme-right Vox. Speakers attacked the government for a string of policies and decisions, ranging from an amnesty for Catalan independence campaigners to its pacts with regional separatist parties, as well as for corruption probes affecting Socialist party figures and Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez. Around 25,000 people took part, according to the central government's office in the region. Organizers put the turnout at roughly 400,000. Protesters held up placards reading 'Get lost Sanchez' and 'Sanchez is destroying Spain' as well as slogans opposing immigration. Vox leader Santiago Abascal, the only party leader to attend, told reporters: 'This government is ruining Spaniards, has betrayed them, has lied to them.' 'Today Spaniards, whatever the government says, are poorer than when Pedro Sanchez came to power. It is harder for them to make ends meet,' he added. More Spaniards are in work and incomes have risen, but so have inflation and rents. Sanchez, in office since 2018, heads a fragile minority government which relies on the votes of Catalan and Basque separatist parties in parliament to pass legislation. His concessions to these parties have infuriated some on the right.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-join-right-wing-rally-against-spanish-government-/7829273.html	2024-10-20T07:13:41-07:00	
NYC officials envision turning Fifth Avenue into grand boulevard	New York — Manhattan’s famed luxury store row Fifth Avenue is in line for a major makeover. New York City officials unveiled a plan last week to transform a central portion of the thoroughfare between Bryant Park and Central Park into a more pedestrian-centered boulevard. They propose doubling the size of sidewalks, reducing traffic lanes from five to three, as well as adding seating areas and hundreds of trees and planters, among other improvements. The vision is to emulate iconic strolling and shopping boulevards such as the Champs-Élysées in Paris. 'As we celebrate the 200th anniversary of one of the most famous streets in the world, New Yorkers can look forward to a brand-new Fifth Avenue that will return the street to its former glory as a pedestrian boulevard,' Madelyn Wils, interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association, which runs the local business improvement district, said in a statement. 'Reversing the century-old trend of putting cars first, this visionary design will transform our overcrowded avenue into a spacious and green corridor for shoppers and workers, visitors and New Yorkers, and everyone on Fifth.' The plan would cost more than $350 million and be paid through a mix of public and private financing, according to Mayor Eric Adams’ administration and the Future of Fifth Partnership. Officials said the project represents the avenue’s first major redesign and could pay for itself in less than five years through increased property and sales tax revenue. But some transit advocates have voiced concerns, saying the plan does not give enough consideration to the needs of the public bus system or the city’s many cyclists. A public meeting will be held later this month on the plan, and construction could begin in 2028. Officials say Fifth Avenue is roughly 100 feet wide, with just two 23-foot sidewalks, even though pedestrians make up 70% of all traffic on the corridor. Some 5,500 pedestrians traverse its blocks on average each hour, a number that swells to 23,000 people an hour during the holidays, officials said. 'People across the globe identify Fifth Avenue as a premier destination for strolling and shopping,' Meera Joshi, the city’s deputy mayor for operations, said in a statement. 'But its larger-than-life reputation means that its sidewalks have reached their capacity, hosting more people per hour in peak seasons than Madison Square Garden.' The Fifth Avenue plan was among other ambitious plans for roadways city officials revealed [last] week. They also proposed capping stretches of the Cross Bronx Expressway, a major highway that cuts through the borough of the Bronx. City officials said the proposals would build parks and greenspaces atop the covered highway, helping restore urban neighborhoods hollowed out by the expansion of the national highway system and the development of suburbs. 'This is a historic opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and reconnect communities once again,' Joshi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nyc-officials-envision-turning-fifth-avenue-into-grand-boulevard/7829266.html	2024-10-20T07:03:44-07:00	
Kenya's impeached deputy president blasts 'vicious' boss	Nairobi — Kenya's ousted Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua on Sunday lashed out at his boss William Ruto as 'vicious' and cruel, warning that his life could be in danger. Gachagua was impeached by the Senate on five out of 11 charges levelled against him on Thursday, but a court order put his replacement process on hold. 'I am shocked by how vicious a man I helped to be president, believed in and was persecuted when I supported could be so vicious against me,' he told reporters. The embattled 59-year-old said his security had been withdrawn and his entire staff sent on compulsory leave. 'If anything happens to me or my family, President William Ruto must be held to account,' he said, claiming past attempts at his life. He was speaking after he was discharged from a hospital in the capital Nairobi where he was being treated for severe chest pains. Gachagua fell ill on Thursday barely an hour before he was due to testify in the unprecedented two-day impeachment trial. The upper house proceeded to vote on his removal from his office after his lawyers unsuccessfully bid to postpone the session. He was found guilty on charges including threatening judges and practicing ethnically divisive politics, but cleared of corruption and money-laundering. In the fast-moving political drama, Ruto swiftly nominated Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki to replace Gachagua. But a High Court in the capital suspended the appointment process within minutes of parliament voting overwhelmingly to approve Kindiki, a 52-year-old academic turned political heavyweight. A three-judge bench is due to hear the case on Tuesday. 'The president in total violation of the court order viciously withdrew security around me,' Gachagua said, despite him still being deputy president. 'I don't understand this level of viciousness... at his lowest moment in life when he is literally struggling to stay alive, you unleash such viciousness against him.' Ruto has not yet given any public comment on the impeachment. Gachagua is the first deputy president to be ousted in this manner since impeachment was introduced in Kenya's revised 2010 constitution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-impeached-deputy-president-blasts-vicious-boss/7829239.html	2024-10-20T06:25:37-07:00	
Post-revolution Bangladesh protests cost garment industry $400m	Dhaka, Bangladesh — Bangladesh's vital garment industry lost $400 million due to unrest following the student-led revolution that ousted the country’s autocratic premier, industry leaders said Sunday, insisting the situation was now 'stable.' The South Asian nation's 3,500 garment factories account for around 85% of its $55 billion in annual exports, but the unrest caused significant disruptions to the linchpin industry. After months of deadly protests, ex-leader Sheikh Hasina fled by helicopter to neighboring India on August 5. An interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus took over, but protests in a string of garment factories continued with workers demanding jobs and better pay. Such demonstrations sometimes spiraled into violence. On September 30, a garment worker was killed and 20 were injured in clashes between protesters and the police. Kalpana Akhtar, president of the Bangladesh Garments and Industrial Workers Federation, said Sunday that there had to be 'a drastic change in the attitude' of factory owners and the government. 'The discussion about pay raises only takes place when the workers take to the streets', Akhtar told AFP. She said changes were needed 'to ensure stability in this sector', warning that 'otherwise, the calm situation might not last.' Bangladesh is the world's second-biggest exporter of clothing by value after China and supplies many of the world's top brands, including Levi's, Zara and H&M. Khandaker Rafiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the 'industry is currently stable after going through a challenging period.' Islam, speaking to reporters on Saturday, estimated losses since August to total around $400 million, and said security forces needed to continue protecting the industry. 'The army formed a task force to protect the factories, and they are conducting regular patrols to ensure security at the garment hubs,' Islam said. 'The buyers have regained their trust in Bangladeshi apparel, but uninterrupted law and order is essential to maintain stability.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/post-revolution-bangladesh-protests-cost-garment-industry-400m-/7829159.html	2024-10-20T03:45:44-07:00	
Libyan held in Germany over suspected Israel embassy plot	Berlin — A Libyan suspected of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin and links to the Islamic State group will appear before a judge on Sunday, German prosecutors said. The suspect, identified only as Omar A., was arrested on Saturday evening at his home in Bernau, just outside the German capital, the federal prosecutors' office said. Omar A. was accused of planning a 'high-profile attack with firearms' on the Israeli Embassy in Berlin, they said. As part of his preparations, Omar A. was suspected of having 'exchanges with a member of IS in a messenger chat,' said the prosecutors, who described him as a supporter of the group's ideology. In a message on X, Israel's ambassador to Berlin said, 'Muslim anti-Semitism is no longer just hate rhetoric. It leads to and encourages terrorist activities worldwide.' Israeli embassies were 'on the front line of the diplomatic battlefield,' ambassador Ron Prosor said. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said protecting Jewish and Israeli institutions in Germany was 'of the utmost importance to us.' Law enforcement were acting with the 'utmost vigilance' to prevent any suspected 'Islamist, antisemitic and anti-Israel violence,' Faeser said. Foreign tipoff Prosecutors said Omar A. would appear on Sunday before a judge who would decide if he should be remanded in custody. Authorities said they searched the 28-year-old's home in Bernau on Saturday. They also searched the property near Bonn of another person 'not suspected' of involvement in the alleged plan. German daily Bild said the flat in the town of Sankt Augustin near Bonn belonged to the suspect's uncle, who was being treated as a witness. German authorities arrested Omar A. after a tipoff from a foreign intelligence agency, Bild said, adding that he had not been on any militant watchlist in Germany. Bild said the Libyan man was thought to have entered Germany in November 2022 and to have made a request for asylum the following January, which was rejected in September 2023. Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's retaliatory onslaught on Gaza, German authorities have increased vigilance about possible Islamist threats and antisemitism. In early September, Munich police shot dead a young Austrian man known for his links to radical Islamism after he opened fire at the Israeli Consulate and on police. In early October, there were explosions near the Israeli Embassy in Denmark and gunfire near its mission in Sweden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/libyan-held-in-germany-over-suspected-israel-embassy-plot-/7829149.html	2024-10-20T03:18:52-07:00	
Israel escalates Beirut bombing, says it hit Hezbollah ‘command center’	Jerusalem — Fighting raged on two fronts Sunday as Israel targeted what it said was a Hezbollah 'command center' in the Lebanese capital, while in Gaza rescuers reported 73 people killed in a single airstrike. The strikes on Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Iran-backed group of attempting to assassinate him by targeting his residence. It also came as Israelis marked the major weeklong Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which last year saw the October 7 Hamas attack that sparked the Gaza war. Lebanon's official National News Agency, NNA, said Israel's strikes on Beirut hit a residential building in Haret Hreik near a mosque and a hospital. The Israeli military said it hit a 'command center of Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters' and underground weapons facility in Beirut, and that it also killed three Hezbollah militants in other strikes. It later said about 70 projectiles fired from Lebanon crossed into Israel within a matter of minutes, and that it intercepted some of them. Gaza's civil defense agency meanwhile said an Israeli air strike on a residential area killed at least 73 Palestinians in Beit Lahia in the territory's north. 'Our civil defense crews recovered 73 martyrs and a large number of wounded as a result of the Israeli air force targeting a residential area... in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza,' said civil defense agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal. The Israeli military said it struck a 'Hamas terror target.' It added that the toll figures given by Gaza authorities 'do not align' with the information it possessed. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The military pressed its offensives in both Gaza and Lebanon, where it said its forces 'struck approximately 175 terror targets.' The military said it continued to operate in northern, central and southern parts of Gaza. 'The troops eliminated dozens of terrorists during close-quarter encounters on the ground and aerial strikes' across Gaza, it said. 'Grave mistake' In southern Lebanon, NNA later said Israeli strikes had targeted dozens of locations, including the city of Nabatiyeh for the third time this week. The military said it 'struck and eliminated over 65 Hezbollah terrorists ... and struck dozens of Hezbollah terror targets' in southern Lebanon. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office said a drone was launched toward his residence in the central town of Caesarea, but he and his wife were away and there were no casualties. 'The attempt by Iran's proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake,' the prime minister said. 'Anyone who tries to harm Israel's citizens will pay a heavy price,' he said in comments directed at Tehran and 'its proxies,' which include Lebanon's Hezbollah, a group Israel has been at war with since late September. Since then, the war has killed at least 1,454 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The Lebanese group, armed and financed by Iran, did not acknowledge the attack, but late on Saturday Iran's mission to the United Nations said 'this action was taken' by Hezbollah. Hezbollah on Saturday said it launched rocket barrages at Israel's north, where rescuers said one man was killed by shrapnel. Hamas, Hezbollah and allied Iran-backed groups in the region have vowed to keep fighting after Israeli troops on Wednesday killed the Palestinian movement's leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, more than a year into the war triggered by Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. 'Hamas is a reality in Palestine that no one can ignore, no one can destroy,' Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. Israel has vowed to respond to Iran's October 1 attack, in which Tehran said it had fired 200 missiles at its arch-foe in response to the killing of an Iranian general and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. 'Every day a massacre' Civil defense spokesperson Bassal said 'we have recovered more than 400 martyrs from the various targeted areas in the northern Gaza Strip,' including Jabalia and its refugee camp, since Israel's operation began. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it was looking into the civil defense agency's reports from Gaza, including that an overnight air raid on Jabalia killed 33 people. 'More than a year has passed, and every day our blood is shed,' displaced Gazan Nasser Shaqura said outside a hospital in Deir el-Balah, where victims of an Israeli air strike were taken. 'Every day, every hour, there is a massacre,' he said. 'This is what our lives have become.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-escalates-beirut-bombing-says-it-hit-hezbollah-command-center-/7829147.html	2024-10-20T02:57:29-07:00	
Kyiv launches more than 100 drones over Russia; missile strike on Ukraine injures 17	KYIV, Ukraine — Russian air defenses shot down more than 100 Ukrainian drones Sunday over Russia's western regions, Moscow officials said, while 17 people were injured in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in a ballistic missile attack. The Russian Defense Ministry said 110 drones were destroyed in the overnight barrage against seven Russian regions. Many targeted Russia's border region of Kursk, where 43 drones were reportedly shot down. Social media footage appeared to show air defenses at work over the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Nizhny Novgorod region, close to a factory producing explosives. Local Gov. Gleb Nikitin wrote on social media Sunday that four fighters had been injured repelling a drone attack over Dzerzhinsk's industrial zone, but he did not give further details. Such large-scale aerial attacks are still relatively rare over Russia 2 1/2 years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A similar attack at the end of September saw Russia's Ministry of Defense report the destruction of 125 drones across seven regions. Meanwhile, 17 people were injured in Ukraine's Kryvyi Rih after the city was hit with two Russian ballistic missiles, officials said Sunday. The attack late Saturday evening damaged homes and businesses, said local administration head Oleksandr Vilkul. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched some 800 guided aerial bombs and more than 500 attack drones over Ukraine in the past week alone. 'Every day, Russia strikes our cities and communities. It is deliberate terror from the enemy against our people,' he said, renewing calls for continued air support from the country's allies. 'United in defense, the world can stand against this targeted terror.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyiv-launches-more-than-100-drones-over-russia-missile-strike-on-ukraine-injures-17/7829135.html	2024-10-20T02:19:21-07:00	
In Modi's Delhi, Indian Muslims segregate to seek security	NEW DELHI — In February 2020, Nasreen and her husband, Tofik, were living in Shiv Vihar, an upcoming neighborhood in northeast New Delhi. But that month, riots erupted targeting Muslims like them, and Tofik was pushed by a mob from the second floor of the building where they lived, according to a police report he filed days later from hospital. He survived but has a permanent limp and was only able to return to work selling clothes on the street after spending nearly three years recuperating. Soon after the riots the couple moved to Loni, a more remote area with poorer infrastructure and job prospects -- but with a sizable Muslim population. 'I will not go back to that area. I feel safer among Muslims,' Tofik, who like his wife goes by one name, told Reuters. Reuters interviewed about two dozen people, who described how Muslims in the Indian capital have been congregating in enclaves away from the nation's Hindu majority, seeking safety in numbers following the deadly 2020 riot and an increase in anti-Muslim hate speech. There is no official data on segregation in India, whose long-delayed census also means that there are few reliable figures on how much Muslim enclaves have grown in the past decade. Muslims comprise about 14% of India's 1.4 billion people. Ground zero in Delhi is the central neighborhood of Jamia Nagar, which has long been a temporary sanctuary for Muslims when communal riots break out. With ever more Muslims flocking in, the neighborhood is overflowing, despite a boom in construction, according to 10 local leaders, including politicians, activists and clergy, as well as five real estate agents. 'No matter how brave a Muslim might be, they feel they have to move because if a mob comes, how brave can you really be?' said Raes Khan, a real estate agent in South Delhi who said Muslim clients now almost exclusively demand homes in Muslim-majority areas like Jamia Nagar. Segregation nationally has increased significantly in the past decade, said London School of Economics political anthropologist Raphael Susewind, who has overseen long-term fieldwork on India's Muslim population. Rising Islamophobia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came into power in 2014, is a 'key driver' of the trend, he said. Six Muslim community leaders said significant anecdotal evidence supported Susewind's assertion that segregation has increased. Jamia Nagar clergyman Md Sahil said the number of attendees at his mosque's early morning prayers had more than doubled to over 450 in the past four to five years, and that it reflected the overall rise in population there. In response to Reuters' questions, Jamal Siddiqui, a senior BJP official for minority affairs, suggested that poorer Muslims might choose to live in segregated areas because such neighborhoods tend to be more affordable. 'Educated Muslims leave the area and settle in developed areas with mixed population,' he said. However, Syed Sayeed Hasan, a Congress party worker in Jamia Nagar, said a big push factor for sectarian cloistering in Delhi was the 2020 riot. More than 200 were injured and at least 53 people, mostly Muslim, were killed in protests after Modi's Hindu nationalist government moved to introduce a law that made it easier for many non-Muslims to become citizens. A 2020 Delhi government report blamed the riots on BJP leaders who made speeches that called for violence against protesters. At the time, the party said the allegations were baseless and that law enforcement had said there was no proof one of the leaders blamed in the report was responsible. The Delhi government, controlled by the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, did not respond to requests for comment. Rise in hate speech India's National Crime Records Bureau, a government agency that collects and analyzes crime data, doesn't keep records on targeted violence against communities. It said the average number of annual riots with communal origins had fallen about 9% between 2014 and 2022 as compared to the previous nine years, when the Congress party ran India. But independent experts at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a Washington-based think-tank, have documented a significant increase in anti-Muslim hate speech, from 255 incidents in first half of 2023 to 413 in the second half of 2023. BJP politicians and affiliate groups were key to the trend, the think-tank said. Reuters has previously reported about how right-wing 'cow vigilantes,' some of whom have ties to the BJP, have led lynch mobs against Muslims. Modi, while campaigning in April for a third term as premier, attacked Muslims as 'infiltrators' who had 'more children,' implying they were a threat to India's Hindu majority. The BJP's Siddiqui added that Modi was referring to undocumented immigrants like Rohingya Muslims whom he alleged 'are living in India and are also weakening India.' When previously asked about alleged anti-Muslim bias, the BJP government has said it does not discriminate and that many of its anti-poverty programs have benefited Muslims, who are among the poorest groups in India. The BJP could only form a fragile coalition government after national election results were announced in June. In the immediate aftermath, at least eight anti-Muslim lynching incidents were reported, the non-governmental Association for Protection of Civil Rights said on July 5. Safety in numbers A 2023 study from British, American and Indian economists that analyzed 1.5 million Indian areas found that public services like water and schools were comparatively rare in neighborhoods popular with Muslims and that children in such areas often face educational disadvantages. Nasreen's neighbor Malika also moved to the outskirts after her husband was killed in the 2020 riots. But she was unable to find a job and now also lives part-time at a small room in another neighborhood with more Hindu residents, where she is close to construction sites where she does odd jobs. 'Here I am afflicted with poverty, there I'm afflicted with insecurity,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-modi-s-delhi-indian-muslims-segregate-to-seek-security/7828404.html	2024-10-20T01:30:13-07:00	
Tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla turns AI boom into digital gold mine	The artificial intelligence boom has benefited chatbot makers, computer scientists and Nvidia investors. It's also providing an unusual windfall for Anguilla, a tiny island in the Caribbean. ChatGPT's debut nearly two years ago heralded the dawn of the AI age and kicked off a digital gold rush as companies scrambled to stake their own claims by acquiring websites that end in .ai. That's where Anguilla comes in. The British territory was allotted control of the .ai internet address in the 1990s. It was one of hundreds of obscure top-level domains assigned to individual countries and territories based on their names. While the domains are supposed to indicate a website has a link to a particular region or language, it's not always a requirement. Google uses google.ai to showcase its artificial intelligence services while Elon Musk uses x.ai as the homepage for his Grok AI chatbot. Startups like AI search engine Perplexity have also snapped up .ai web addresses, redirecting users from the .com version. Anguilla's earnings from web domain registration fees quadrupled last year to $32 million, fueled by the surging interest in AI. The income now accounts for about 20% of Anguilla's total government revenue. Before the AI boom, it hovered at around 5%. Anguilla's government, which uses the gov.ai home page, collects a fee every time an .ai web address is renewed. The territory signed a deal Tuesday with a U.S. company to manage the domains amid explosive demand but the fees aren't expected to change. It also gets paid when new addresses are registered and expired ones are sold off. Some sites have fetched tens of thousands of dollars. The money directly boosts the economy of Anguilla, which is just 91 square kilometers and has a population of about 16,000. Blessed with coral reefs, clear waters and palm-fringed white sand beaches, the island is a haven for uber-wealthy tourists. Still, many residents are underprivileged, and tourism has been battered by the pandemic and, before that, a powerful hurricane. Anguilla doesn't have its own AI industry though Premier Ellis Webster hopes that one day it will become a hub for the technology. He said it was just luck that it was Anguilla, and not nearby Antigua, that was assigned the .ai domain in 1995 because both places had those letters in their names. Webster said the money takes the pressure off government finances and helps fund key projects but cautioned that 'we can't rely on it solely.' 'You can't predict how long this is going to last,' Webster said in an interview with the AP. 'And so I don't want to have our economy and our country and all our programs just based on this. And then all of a sudden there's a new fad comes up in the next year or two, and then we are left now having to make significant expenditure cuts, removing programs.' To help keep up with the explosive growth in domain registrations, Anguilla said Tuesday it's signing a deal with a U.S.-based domain management company, Identity Digital, to help manage the effort. They said the agreement will mean more revenue for the government while improving the resilience and security of the web addresses. Identity Digital, which also manages Australia's .au domain, expects to migrate all .ai domain services to its systems by the start of next year, Identity Digital Chief Strategy Officer Ram Mohan said in an interview. A local software entrepreneur had previously helped Anguilla set up its registry system decades earlier. There are now more than 533,000 .ai web domains, an increase of more than 10-fold since 2018. The International Monetary Fund said in a May report that the earnings will help diversify the economy, 'thus making it more resilient to external shocks. Webster expects domain-related revenues to rise further and could even double this year from last year's $32 million. He said the money will finance the airport's expansion, free medical care for senior citizens and completion of a vocational technology training center at Anguilla's high school. The income also provides 'budget support' for other projects the government is eyeing, such as a national development fund it could quickly tap for hurricane recovery efforts. The island normally relies on assistance from its administrative power, Britain, which comes with conditions, Webster said. Mohan said working with Identity Digital will also defend against cyber crooks trying to take advantage of the hype around artificial intelligence. He cited the example of Tokelau, an island in the Pacific Ocean, whose .tk addresses became notoriously associated with spam and phishing after outsourcing its registry services. 'We worry about bad actors taking something, sticking a .ai to it, and then making it sound like they are much bigger or much better than what they really are,' Mohan said, adding that the company's technology will quickly take down shady sites. Another benefit is .AI websites will no longer need to connect to the government's digital infrastructure through a single internet cable to the island, which leaves them vulnerable to digital bottlenecks or physical disruptions. Now they'll use the company's servers distributed globally, which means it will be faster to access them because they'll be closer to users. 'It goes from milliseconds to microseconds,' Mohan said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiny-caribbean-island-of-anguilla-turns-ai-boom-into-digital-gold-mine/7827101.html	2024-10-20T01:29:43-07:00	
Broke Argentine province counters austerity cuts with new currency	LA RIOJA, Argentina — They look like cash, fit into wallets like cash and the governor promises they'll be treated like cash. But these brightly colored banknotes aren't pesos, the depreciating national currency of Argentina, or U.S. dollars, everyone's money of choice here. They are chachos, a new emergency tender invented by the left-wing populist governor of La Rioja, a province in the country's northwest that went broke when far-right President Javier Milei slashed federal budget transfers to provinces as part of an unprecedented austerity program. 'Who would have imagined that one day I'd find myself wishing I'd gotten pesos?' said Lucia Vera, a music teacher emerging from a gymnasium packed with state workers waiting to get their monthly bonus of chachos worth 50,000 pesos (about $40). Across La Rioja's capital, 'Chachos accepted here' decals now appear on the windows of everything from chain supermarkets and gas stations to upscale restaurants and hair salons. The local government guarantees a 1-to-1 exchange rate with pesos, and accepts chachos for tax payments and utilities bills. But there's a catch. Chachos can't be used outside La Rioja, and only registered businesses can swap chachos for pesos at a few government exchange points. 'I need real money,' said Adriana Parcas, a 22-year-old street vendor who pays her suppliers in pesos, after turning down two customers in a row who asked if they could buy her perfumes with chachos. The bills bear the face of Ángel Vicente 'Chacho' Peñaloza, the caudillo, or strongman, famed for defending La Rioja in a 19th-century battle against national authorities in Buenos Aires. A QR code on the banknote links to a website denouncing Milei for refusing to transfer La Rioja its fair share of federal funds. After entering office in December 2023, Milei swiftly imposed his shock therapy in a bid to reverse decades of budget-busting populism that ran up Argentina's monumental deficits. The cuts squeezed all of Argentina's 23 provinces but boiled over into a full-blown crisis in La Rioja, where the public payroll accounts for two-thirds of registered workers and the federal government's redistributed taxes cover some 90% of the provincial budget. With just 384,600 people and little industry beyond walnuts and olives, La Rioja received more discretionary federal funds than any other last year except Buenos Aires, home to 17.6 million people. Yet the province's poverty rate tops 66% — the result, critics say, of a patronage system long used to placate interest groups at the expense of efficiency. While Milei's reforms forced other provinces to tighten their belts and lay off thousands of employees, Governor Ricardo Quintela — an ambitious power broker in Argentina's long-dominant Peronist movement and one of Milei's fiercest critics — refused to absorb the strife of austerity. 'I'm not going to take food from the people of La Rioja to pay the debt that the government owes us,' Quintela told The Associated Press, portraying his chacho-printing plan as a daring stand against 10 months of crumbling wages, rising unemployment and deepening misery under Milei. La Rioja defaulted on its debts in February and August. A New York federal judge ordered the province to pay American and British bondholders nearly $40 million in damages in September. Argentina's Supreme Court is taking up the case of the province's refusal to charge consumers sky-high prices for electricity after Milei's removal of subsidies. 'There's an alternative path to the cruelty of policies that the president is applying,' Quintela said. He appeared confident, speaking as Milei's approval ratings dipped below 50% for the first time since the radical economist came to power. But as Milei and his allies tell it, Quintela's alternative offers little more than a return to Argentina's habitual Peronist preserve of reckless spending — and insolvency — that delivered the unmitigated crisis that his government inherited. 'You were used to having your tie fastened for you and your shoes polished, but now, you've got to tie the knot yourself,' Eduardo Serenellini, press secretary of Milei's office, snapped at La Rioja business leaders on a recent visit to the province. 'When you run out of cash, you run out cash.' Serenellini picked up a chacho note, then flicked it away like lint. Gov. Quintela's gambit in the remote province has had little effect on Argentina's federal finances, but that could change if more cash-strapped provinces catch on, as happened during Argentina's terrible financial crisis of 2001, when a similarly brutal austerity scheme sent over a dozen provinces scrambling to print their own parallel currencies. Unlike two decades ago, when former President Néstor Kirchner, a Peronist, put an end to the chaos by redeeming 'patacones,' 'cecacores' and 'boncanfores' for pesos, President Milei has ruled out a bailout for La Rioja. 'We will not be accomplices to irresponsible people,' Milei warned in a recent interview with Argentine TV channel Todo Noticias. But the libertarian purist added that he couldn't stop La Rioja from doing what it pleased, considering that Argentina's constitution allows for such desperate financial workarounds. The chacho hit the streets in August after La Rioja's legislature approved plans to run off $22.5 billion pesos worth of the currency to help cover up to 30% of public sector salaries. With La Rioja's average income sinking below $200 per month and stores shuttering for lack of business, authorities doled out 8.4 billion pesos worth of the scrip in monthly bonuses in August and September, an effort to help workers cope with Argentina's 230% annual inflation and spur the stricken local economy. To encourage the chacho's use, authorities promise to pay interest of 17% on bills held to maturity on December 31. 'The closer we get to the expiration date, the more we'll see public confidence in the chacho increase,' said provincial treasurer adviser Carlos Nardillo Giraud. Most state workers interviewed in the many chacho lines spilling onto La Rioja's sidewalks last month said they wanted to get rid of the bills as quickly as possible. 'Now the chacho is an alternative, an option for people who can't make it to the end of the month,' said 30-year-old physics teacher Daniela Parra, mounting her boyfriend's motorcycle with arms full of chachos, ready to spend them all in one go at the supermarket. 'Who knows what will it be next month?' On the streets, merchants said they felt locked in a catch-22. Rejecting chachos meant turning away customers with new spending power in a deep recession. But accepting chachos meant filling cash registers with money that's worthless to foreign suppliers and already changing hands at a discount to pesos on the street. 'They've formed a system where you're forced to depend on the state for everything,' said Juan Keulian, the director of La Rioja's Center for Commerce and Industry. 'There's no choice in a place like this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/broke-argentine-province-counters-austerity-cuts-with-new-currency/7827051.html	2024-10-20T01:29:12-07:00	
Whooping cough is at a decade-high level in US	MILWAUKEE — Whooping cough is at its highest level in a decade for this time of year, U.S. health officials reported Thursday. There have been 18,506 cases of whooping cough reported so far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That's the most at this point in the year since 2014, when cases topped 21,800. The increase is not unexpected — whooping cough peaks every three to five years, health experts said. And the numbers indicate a return to levels before the coronavirus pandemic, when whooping cough and other contagious illnesses plummeted. Still, the tally has some state health officials concerned, including those in Wisconsin, where there have been about 1,000 cases so far this year, compared to a total of 51 last year. Nationwide, CDC has reported that kindergarten vaccination rates dipped last year and vaccine exemptions are at an all-time high. Thursday, it released state figures, showing that about 86% of kindergartners in Wisconsin got the whooping cough vaccine, compared to more than 92% nationally. Whooping cough, also called pertussis, usually starts out like a cold, with a runny nose and other common symptoms, before turning into a prolonged cough. It is treated with antibiotics. Whooping cough used to be very common until a vaccine was introduced in the 1950s, which is now part of routine childhood vaccinations. It is in a shot along with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The combo shot is recommended for adults every 10 years. 'They used to call it the 100-day cough because it literally lasts for 100 days,' said Joyce Knestrick, a family nurse practitioner in Wheeling, West Virginia. Whooping cough is usually seen mostly in infants and young children, who can develop serious complications. That's why the vaccine is recommended during pregnancy, to pass along protection to the newborn, and for those who spend a lot of time with infants. But public health workers say outbreaks this year are hitting older kids and teens. In Pennsylvania, most outbreaks have been in middle school, high school and college settings, an official said. Nearly all the cases in Douglas County, Nebraska, are schoolkids and teens, said Justin Frederick, deputy director of the health department. That includes his own teenage daughter. 'It's a horrible disease. She still wakes up — after being treated with her antibiotics — in a panic because she's coughing so much she can't breathe,' he said. It's important to get tested and treated with antibiotics early, said Dr. Kris Bryant, who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at Norton Children's in Louisville, Kentucky. People exposed to the bacteria can also take antibiotics to stop the spread. 'Pertussis is worth preventing,' Bryant said. 'The good news is that we have safe and effective vaccines.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/whooping-cough-is-at-a-decade-high-level-in-us/7828392.html	2024-10-20T00:57:20-07:00	
New Zealand exempts abuse victims from forced wait before they can seek divorce	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand lawmakers unanimously voted Wednesday to exempt victims of domestic violence from a mandatory two-year separation period before divorce can be sought. The required cooling-off period before a couple in New Zealand can file for divorce — during which they must also live apart — is the longest among no-fault divorce laws in comparable countries, including Australia, Britain, Canada and most states in the U.S. Wednesday's change means a victim of domestic violence can seek dissolution of a marriage or civil partnership as soon as a protection order against the spouse is granted. Lawmakers said in speeches at Parliament in Wellington that some survivors had told them the long reflection period made leaving an abusive relationship difficult and increased the chance they would return to a violent partner. 'Two years holds the tie. It binds the victim to their abuser,' said Deborah Russell, the lawmaker who sponsored the bill. 'That should not be the case.' All 123 members of parliament voted for the change, in a rare show of political unity. Lawmakers cited New Zealand's domestic violence figures, which are widely considered one of the country's most entrenched and thorny social problems. Police figures for the year ending in June 2023 show that more than 177,000 family harm investigations were recorded in the country of 5 million people, a 49% increase since 2017. Some said more law changes were needed to ensure those leaving violent marriages were not rushed through property division or custody agreements while emotions were high. Others suggested more forms of evidence that abuse had taken place should be accepted. Currently, a formal protection order must be granted before an expedited divorce is allowed. New Zealand has permitted no-fault divorce, in which a couple need not state a reason for splitting, since 1980. In neighboring Australia, a couple must separate for 12 months before divorcing but they can choose to remain under the same roof. The U.K. introduced no-fault divorces in 2022, with a 20-week waiting period. Until then, couples had to cite a reason, including infidelity or abuse, to be granted a dissolution. All 50 U.S. states allow for no-fault divorce, with some requiring separation periods — most shorter than New Zealand's. In recent years, conservative commentators and lawmakers in a handful of states have urged reversals of no-fault divorce laws. Lawmakers credited three women, all survivors of abusive marriages, with prompting New Zealand's shift. Ashley Jones had approached her local member of Parliament, Chris Bishop, after leaving an abusive marriage in 2020 and later took a petition to Parliament on the matter. It took more than 1,000 days after she left her husband for Jones to be granted a divorce, she said in 2023. 'We get a lot of grief in this place, probably sometimes fairly, about being fixated on things that don't actually matter that much,' Bishop told Parliament on Wednesday.

Armed groups hinder Colombia deforestation efforts, report finds	BOGOTA, Colombia — Armed groups operating in Colombia's Amazon are tightening their grip on the region and that's stalling government efforts to tackle deforestation, according to a think tank report Thursday. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) dissidents, known as EMC, have the ability to slow or accelerate deforestation at will, said the report by The International Crisis Group. Some of the former FARC members never signed and disagree with the 2016 FARC-Colombia peace deal. Others signed it but took up arms again, while others are new to the dissident ranks either as volunteers or forced fighters, said Rodrigo Botero, director of The Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development (FCDS). EMC is currently Colombia's third largest armed group, with around 3,500 members. 'This group is the most directly responsible for deforestation in the last five years,' Botero said. 'More than half a million hectares have been lost in their control zones.' 'Over the last year,' he said, 'the EMC has given orders to the population to suspend deforestation, but this year they have increased it again.' More than 40% of Colombia is in the Amazon — an area roughly the size of Spain. The country has the world's largest bird biodiversity. Fifteen percent of the Colombian Amazon has already been deforested, according to FCDS. Colombia's first leftist administration under Gustavo Petro stakes much of its legitimacy on its environmental and peace agenda, Crisis Group researcher and report coauthor Bram Ebus told The Associated Press. 'However, as Colombia's natural environment continues to suffer from the severe impacts of conflict dynamics and economic activities that fuel violence, his political legacy is at risk,' Ebus said. Colombia's environment ministry said in a statement Thursday that saving the Amazon rainforest has been one of Petro's main priorities and it has achieved a historic reduction of deforestation by 61% in the last two years. While acknowledging 'the difficulties with the dynamics of peace in the territory and the armed actors,' the ministry said it wants to build a forest development model that benefits Amazon communities, recovers the forest and stops illegal deforestation. Previous administrations opted for punitive measures against Amazon communities complicit in deforestation, while Petro offers incentives, proposing financial aid to support forest conservation and promote sustainable livelihoods, Ebus said. 'Nevertheless, the lack of territorial control hampers the implementation of these projects, as armed groups dominate the region, often preventing communities from benefiting from state-funded initiatives,' he said. The EMC is able to impose control over the forests through armed coercion, said Elizabeth Dickinson, Crisis Group senior analyst and report coauthor. She added that in late 2022 and March 2023 local commanders gave strict orders to communities to cease deforesting. 'Anyone who did would be subject to fines, forced community labor and even expulsion from the community,' Dickinson said. But early this year, the EMC lifted restrictions, so it could accelerate its revenue streams from deforestation, she said, adding that the group would force those deforesting to pay an extortion fee to operate. 'One of the things that was very alarming in researching this piece was the extent to which state authorities are not allowed to access areas that are under their (EMC) jurisdiction,' she said. 'So this includes national parks, protected areas.' Dialogue with the EMC is an uphill battle, Ebus said, noting the group has repeatedly violated previously agreed rules during ceasefires and blocked state agencies from entering territories under its control. 'If the Petro administration truly wants to protect the Amazon, it must first regain access to these areas, as armed groups currently are calling the shots,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-groups-hinder-colombia-deforestation-efforts-report-finds/7828428.html	2024-10-20T00:55:38-07:00	
$55M plan to give Notre Dame a green facelift is part of Paris eco plan	PARIS — As Notre Dame gears up to reopen its doors in December, Paris is on the verge of a remarkable eco-revival, bringing nature back to the forefront of the City of Light. Beyond restoring the cathedral's iconic spire and medieval charm, the city announced plans Tuesday to revamp Notre Dame's surroundings — to a tune of 50 million euros ($55 million) — into a serene, green oasis. The project echoes a broader, post-Olympics eco-facelift that's reshaping Paris from its historic monuments to its bustling avenues. Among the key elements of this broader transformation are the revitalization of historic spaces like the Champs-Elysees and Place de la Concorde, a redesign aimed at reducing traffic around the Arc de Triomphe, and green promenades connecting the French capital's landmarks. Here's a look at some of the eco plans for Paris in the coming years: Notre Dame Cathedral: a rebirth in green The reopening on Dec. 8 promises to be a historic moment for Paris, fulfilling President Emmanuel Macron's vow made after the 2019 devastating fire for a five-year timeline. While the cathedral's spire and oak-framed roof have been restored to their pre-fire glory, Paris City Hall's plans for the area around Notre Dame are bringing something new. The ambitious, future-facing project will create 1,800 square meters (around 20,000 square feet) of green space and plant 160 trees, according to a news conference at City Hall that featured speeches from Paris officials, including Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Tuesday. Hidalgo stated that the redesign will integrate nature and the Seine more fully into the area. Hidalgo emphasized that this transformation aims 'to better highlight our beautiful cathedral and do it justice, while respecting its history.' The redesign includes transforming the underground parking area into a visitor space complete with services and amenities. Additionally, the Seine's adjacent quays will be revitalized, offering a new promenade along the river. A belvedere will provide panoramic views of the Ile Saint-Louis and the Seine, further enhancing the visitor experience. The project will unfold in two phases, with the first, focusing on the parvis and surrounding streets, expected to be completed by the end of 2027. The second phase, which will include the renovation of Square Jean-XXIII and other nearby areas, is set to finish by 2030. Place de la Concorde: a transformation At the heart of Paris, the Place de la Concorde — home to the 3,300-year-old Luxor Obelisk — will undergo a significant overhaul between 2026 and 2027. Paris officials have enlisted the input of a dozen architectural experts to envision how to preserve its rich history, while aligning the plaza with the city's modern green ambitions. Expect more greenery and less traffic as the revamp balances historical significance with a fresh eco-friendly design. Eiffel Tower dispute Not everything has been a picnic in Paris's post-Olympics makeover. Two of France's most high-profile female politicians — Hidalgo and Culture Minister Rachida Dati — are engaged in a fierce battle over the future of the Eiffel Tower, casting a shadow over the city's plans for its famed monument. Hidalgo has proposed to keep the Olympic rings affixed to the Eiffel Tower beyond the Games, which ended in August. She argues that the rings symbolize the 'festive spirit' of the successful Paris Olympics and wants them to remain at least until the next Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028. Critics, however, say Hidalgo is using the Eiffel Tower as a political billboard to boost her image before the 2026 mayoral election, in which she is expected to face off against Dati. Dati has been vocal in opposing the plan, arguing that the tower is a protected heritage site and can't be altered without proper consultation. She has accused Hidalgo of using the monument as a 'personal campaign poster,' while Hidalgo counters that the rings are a harmless tribute to Paris' Olympic success. Dati has gone further, launching an ultimatum to push for the Eiffel Tower to be classified as a full historical monument — something Hidalgo has resisted. This would add extra layers of bureaucratic protection and control, potentially thwarting Hidalgo's plans. Champs-Elysees: a greener avenue Paris' Champs-Elysees, sometimes called 'the most beautiful avenue in the world,' is receiving a 30-million-euro facelift, beginning with the renovation of its sidewalks, tree bases, and gardens that began in preparation for the Olympics. With 150 proposals to 're-enchant the Champs-Elysees' over the coming years, this project aims to add even more green spaces and revive its historic charm, reinforcing its reputation as the world's most beautiful avenue. Arc de Triomphe: reducing traffic Changes to the Arc de Triomphe's bustling roundabout are designed to reduce traffic flow and calm the surrounding environment. Traffic lanes encircling the famous monument will be trimmed, while the central ring will be widened, allowing for a quieter, more accessible space. Leading from the Arc de Triomphe to the Bois de Boulogne, the Avenue de la Grande Armee is also getting the green treatment. Authorities plan to recreate a historic green promenade, transforming this major traffic artery into a lush, tree-lined boulevard that reconnects the avenue with the nearby forest, historically converted into a public park in the 19th century under Napoleon III. Louvre Museum to go eco-friendly Paris' Louvre Museum, the world's most visited, will undergo its own transformation under the 'Louvre 2030' project. Though specific details remain sparse, the project aims to address the growing influx of visitors, with a significant redesign of Place du Louvre planned to help manage the crowds and provide a more tranquil, green environment for visitors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m-plan-to-give-notre-dame-a-green-facelift-is-part-of-paris-eco-plan/7825418.html	2024-10-20T00:54:57-07:00	
Many schools are still closed weeks after Hurricane Helene	Tens of thousands of students in the Southeast are dealing with school disruptions after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc so severe — on homes, campuses and municipal power and water systems — that some districts have no idea when they will reopen. While virtual learning helped during the COVID-19 school closures, that has not been an option for this crisis because internet and cellphone service has remained spotty since the storm struck in late September. In hard-hit western North Carolina, some districts warn students will miss up to a month of school, and others say they can't yet determine a timeline for returning to classrooms. 'I feel like a month is a lot, but it's not something that can't be overcome,' said Marissa Coleman, who has sent her four children to stay with grandparents in Texas because their home in North Carolina's Buncombe County has no running water. 'But if we get further into Thanksgiving and Christmas, it's like, how are they actually going to make this up?' In mountainous Buncombe County, Helene swept away homes, cut power and destroyed crucial parts of the water system for Asheville, a city of about 94,000 people. The storm decimated remote towns and killed at least 246 people throughout the Appalachians, where massive cleanup efforts have been complicated by washed-out bridges and roads. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. The Buncombe County School system, which serves over 22,000 students, told families Tuesday on the district's Facebook page no decision has been made 'with regards to start date or length of day' because of a need to repair buildings, restore phone and security systems and redraw bus routes. Even when schools reopen, educators worry the disruption could have profound effects on students' learning and emotional well-being. Children who experience natural disasters are more prone to acute illness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, research shows. The physical and mental health impacts put them at greater risk of learning loss: Absences can undermine achievement, as can the effects of trauma on brain function. The challenges come amid growing concerns about the impacts of climate change on students. Wildfires have swept through communities, displacing families. Many school systems with inadequate heating or air conditioning have closed during extreme weather or forced students and educators to endure sweltering or frigid temperatures. According to the World Bank, 400 million children lost school days because of 'climate-related closures' in 2022. Days after Helene made landfall, Hurricane Milton roared ashore last week farther south along the same Florida coast as a Category 3 storm. While about half the state's districts were closed, all of them were planning to reopen by the end of this week. Schools affected by Helene are trying to provide stability. The Buncombe district has suggested parents trade books with neighbors and friends for their kids. 'Have them write, maybe about something they're looking forward to when school starts again,' the district told parents on social media. 'Turn everyday experiences into math problems.' Cécile Wight, a mother of two in Asheville, said she has been grateful for concern shown by schools including surveys checking on families' well-being and an elementary school bus driver who took his own car to visit each child on his route. 'That has been huge, just having the emotional support from the school system and from the people we know at the school,' she said. But uncertainty remains. Wight said her family is able to stay at their home because they have well water, but many other families have yet to return since evacuating. Most of Buncombe's 45 schools still lacked running water as of Tuesday, meaning they're unable to meet basic safety and hygiene standards. Schools have begun exploring whether it would be possible to open without running water, relying on portable bathroom trailers. In a letter to families, Asheville Superintendent Maggie Furman said the district is considering drilling wells at each school so they don't have to rely on city water. Coleman said her kids are eager for some kind of normalcy. 'I understand the schools are going to have to take some time to find a way to open safely, and I support that 100%. But I definitely am not in the camp of 'We need to wait until we get water back, until everything's normal again to open.' I just think that's going to be too long,' Coleman said. The Tennessee Department of Education is still trying to determine how many schools remain closed since Hurricane Helene and how many took too much damage to reopen. Echoing the COVID-19 pandemic, several schools in Tennessee have postponed traditions like homecoming games, parades and dances. Many colleges are also granting extensions on application deadlines, officials say, to reduce high school seniors' stress. In storm-drenched areas elsewhere, some early education providers may never reopen. Private child care and preschool centers are particularly vulnerable in the aftermath of a natural disaster, said Militza Mezquita, senior adviser for education in emergencies at Save the Children. Many already operate on thin margins, meaning a temporary closure can easily turn permanent. As for-profit companies, they are also ineligible for many types of disaster aid. A natural disaster can wipe out 10% to 20% of providers, Mezquita said. 'Child care recovery is very critical to the whole recovery ecosystem,' Mezquita said, noting the people essential to recovery — road workers, cleanup crews, doctors and nurses — often have young children that need to be looked after. 'If they are not able to adequately get their children in care, they can't go to work.' Despite the instability, educators like Heather Smith, who was named North Carolina's Teacher of the Year in the spring, encourage families to see the lessons storms can provide. Smith brought along her two children, ages 8 and 4, to serve meals at her church. 'Our kids are learning so much every day, whether it's about adversity, whether it's about helping a community,' said Smith, who rode out the storm at her home in Waynesville. Similarly, Wight has been taking her children to volunteer for relief efforts at a school. She said it has helped them feel active and involved in the community. 'If COVID taught us something, it's that we can make things work. The kids are resilient,' Wight said. 'They will eventually catch up on the academic side of things.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/many-schools-are-still-closed-weeks-after-hurricane-helene-/7825430.html	2024-10-20T00:54:22-07:00	
Moldovans cast votes as Russian interference claims spike	CHISINAU, Moldova — Moldovans have started casting ballots in two key votes Sunday that could determine whether the European Union candidate country, which neighbors Ukraine, remains on a pro-Western path amid ongoing allegations that Russia has tried to undermine the electoral process. Incumbent President Maia Sandu is the favorite to secure another term in office in a presidential race in which 11 candidates are running. Voters will also choose 'yes' or 'no' in a referendum on whether to enshrine in the country's constitution its path toward the 27-nation EU. Polls by WatchDog, a Chisinau-based think-tank show a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path. The referendum needs a one-third turnout to be valid. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0400GMT) and are expected to close at 9 p.m. (1800GMT). If Sandu fails to win an outright majority on Sunday, a run-off will be held on November 3 which could pit her against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who is polling at around 10%. The two pivotal ballots are held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged 'hybrid war' campaign to destabilize the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections, and backing a major vote-buying scheme. U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those concerns this week, saying in a statement that 'Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova's election and its European integration.' Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. 'In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova's presidential election,' Kirby said. 'We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.' In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros ($16.2 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots. Shor, who was convicted in absentia last year to 15 years in jail on fraud and money laundering in the case of $1 billion that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014, denied allegations, saying 'the payments are legal' and cited a right to freedom of expression. Shor's populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended 'more advanced training in guerrilla camps' in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Sandu won the presidency, and a parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovans-cast-votes-to-choose-president-decide-on-eu-path/7829123.html	2024-10-20T00:51:25-07:00	
Iraq Kurds head to polls with little hope for change	Arbil, Iraq — Voters in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region headed to the polls Sunday to elect a new parliament for the oil-rich region, where voters have expressed disenchantment with the political elite. Iraqi Kurdistan presents itself as a relative oasis of stability in the turbulent Middle East, attracting foreign investors due to its close ties with the United States and Europe. However, activists and opposition figures contend that the region, autonomous since 1991, faces the same issues affecting Iraq as a whole: corruption, political repression and cronyism among those in power. Originally scheduled for two years ago, the vote has been postponed four times due to disputes between the region's two historic parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Each party is controlled by a powerful Kurdish family -- the KDP by the Barzanis and the PUK by the Talabanis. Despite holding election rallies and mobilizing their patronage networks, experts say there is widespread public disillusionment with the parties, exacerbated by the region's bleak economic conditions. 'I am against this government,' said Dilman Sharif, a 47-year-old civil servant in Sulaimaniyah, the second-largest city in Iraqi Kurdistan and a stronghold of the PUK. 'I urge everyone to mobilize and vote against this regime,' he said before the election. Opposition parties such as New Generation and a movement led by Lahur Sheikh Jangi, a dissident from the Talabani clan, may gain from a protest vote, said Sarteep Jawhar, a PUK dissident and political commentator. The region's more than 1,200 polling stations across four constituencies opened at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and are scheduled to close at 6 p.m. At a polling station in Sulaimaniyah, about 20 people were already lined up to cast their ballots Sunday morning when the voting began. Political analyst Shivan Fazil, a researcher at U.S.-based Boston University with a focus on Iraq, noted that there was 'a growing fatigue with the region's two ruling parties.' 'People's living conditions have deteriorated over the last decade,' he said, citing erratic payment of salaries for the region's 1.2 million civil servants as problematic because the money serves as 'a vital source of income for households.' This issue is tied to ongoing tensions between Kurdistan and the federal Iraqi government in Baghdad. The two administrations have also disputed control of the region's lucrative oil exports. 'Force and money' The creation of the four new constituencies for this election -- a change from only one previously -- 'could lead to redistribution in vote shares and seats in the next parliament,' Fazil said. He still predicted, however, that the KDP would maintain its majority due to its 'internal discipline and cohesion.' The KDP is the largest party in the outgoing parliament, with 45 seats against 21 for the PUK. The KDP's majority was assured by an alliance with deputies elected via a quota reserved for Turkmen, Armenian and Christian minorities. Iraqi court rulings have reduced the number of seats in the Kurdish parliament from 111 to 100, but with five seats still reserved for the minorities. Of the region's 6 million inhabitants, 2.9 million are eligible to vote for the 100 representatives, including 30 women mandated by a quota. In the last regional elections in 2018, voter turnout was 59%. Once elected, the new representatives will need to vote for a new president and prime minister, with both roles currently filled by KDP figures Nechirvan Barzani and his cousin, Masrour Barzani. Mohamed al-Hassan, the United Nations special representative in Iraq, welcomed the election as an opportunity for the Kurdistan region to 'reinvigorate democracy and inject new ideas into its institutions.' However, 55-year-old teacher Sazan Saduala says she will boycott the election. 'This government cannot be changed by voting,' she said. 'It maintains its power through force and money.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraq-kurds-head-to-polls-with-little-hope-for-change/7829106.html	2024-10-19T23:35:19-07:00	
Japan's beloved former Empress Michiko marks her 90th birthday	tokyo — Japan's beloved former Empress Michiko received greetings from her relatives and palace officials to celebrate her 90th birthday Sunday as she steadily recovers from a broken leg, officials said. Michiko is the first commoner to become empress in modern Japanese history. Catholic-educated Michiko Shoda and then-Crown Prince Akihito married on April 10, 1959, after what is known as their tennis court romance. The couple retired after Akihito abdicated in 2019 as their son, Emperor Naruhito, ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne and his wife, Masako, became empress. Since then, Akihito and Michiko have largely withdrawn from public appearance to enjoy their quiet life together, taking daily walks inside the palace gardens or occasionally taking private trips, hosting small gatherings for book reading and music, according to the Imperial Household Agency. Former Emperor Akihito has been concerned about Michiko's physical strength and asking how she is feeling, officials said. Michiko, who fell earlier in October at her residence and had surgery for her femoral fracture, was steadily recovering with a daily rehabilitation session for about an hour at a time, palace officials said. She was expected to be in a wheelchair when joining her well-wishers for Sunday's celebration. The former empress was deeply concerned about the people affected by the deadly January 1 earthquake in Japan's north-central region of Noto, especially those who suffered additional damage from September's heavy rains and floods, the palace said. Since retirement, Michiko has shared her love of literature, including children's books, English poetry and music, with her friends as well as with Akihito. The palace said she reads parts of a book aloud with her husband as a daily routine after breakfast. They are currently reading a book chosen by Akihito about war and Okinawa, a southern Japanese island where one of the harshest ground battles took place at the end of World War II fought in the name of his father. The couple broke with traditions and brought many changes to the monarchy: They chose to raise their three children themselves, spoke more often to the public, and made amends for war victims in and outside Japan. Their close interactions have won them deep affection among Japanese.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-beloved-former-empress-michiko-marks-her-90th-birthday/7829104.html	2024-10-19T23:25:32-07:00	
Hurricane set to hit Cuba amid national blackout	HAVANA — A hurricane was bearing down on Cuba on Sunday as the island nation's authorities scrambled to restore power following a massive nationwide outage. The expected arrival of Hurricane Oscar, just days after the failure of Cuba's largest power plant crippled the national grid, piles more pressure on a country already battling sky-high inflation and shortages of food, medicine, fuel and water. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Saturday in a post on social media that authorities in the east of the island were 'working hard to protect the people and economic resources, given the imminent arrival of Hurricane Oscar.' Packing winds of 140 kph, Oscar was forecast to reach eastern Cuba on Sunday, where heavy rains are expected, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The Cuban presidency said in another social media post that progress had been made in restoring power, with 16% of consumers receiving electricity and around 500 megawatts being generated. That was a fraction of the country's 3,300-megawatt demand Thursday, the day before the grid collapsed and the government declared an 'energy emergency' following weeks of extended outages. The power grid failed in a chain reaction Friday due to the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, the biggest of the island's eight decrepit coal-fired power plants, according to the head of electricity supply at the energy ministry, Lazaro Guerra. National electric utility UNE said it had managed to generate a minimal amount of electricity to get power plants restarted on Friday night, but by Saturday morning it was experiencing what official news outlet Cubadebate called 'a new, total disconnection of the electrical grid.' Most neighborhoods in Havana remained dark on Saturday, except for hotels and hospitals with emergency generators and the very few private homes with that kind of backup in the economically challenged nation. 'God knows when the power will come back on,' said Rafael Carrillo, a 41-year-old mechanic, who had to walk almost 5 kilometers due to the lack of public transportation amid the blackout. Yaima Vallares, a 28-year-old dancer, told AFP that 'everything is very difficult. For almost a day we have had this blackout that makes life so hard for us.' 'I am trying to remain calm because there is too much stress over everything in this country,' she said. The blackout followed weeks of power outages, lasting up to 20 hours a day in some provinces. Prime Minister Manuel Marrero on Thursday declared an 'energy emergency,' suspending nonessential public services in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes. Schools across the country are now closed until Monday. 'This is crazy,' Eloy Fon, an 80-year-old retiree living in central Havana, told AFP on Friday. 'It shows the fragility of our electricity system. ... We have no reserves, there is nothing to sustain the country, we are living day-to-day.' Leaving Cuba President Diaz-Canel blamed the situation on Cuba's difficulties in acquiring fuel for its power plants, which he attributed to the tightening, during Donald Trump's presidency, of a six-decade-long U.S. trade embargo. Cuba is in the throes of its worst economic crisis since the collapse of key ally the Soviet Union in the early 1990s -- marked by soaring inflation and shortages of basic goods. With no relief in sight, many Cubans have emigrated. More than 700,000 entered the United States between January 2022 and August 2024, according to U.S. officials. While the authorities chiefly blame the U.S. embargo, the island is also feeling the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic battering its critical tourism sector, and of economic mismanagement. To bolster its grid, Cuba has leased seven floating power plants from Turkish companies and also added many small diesel-powered generators. In July 2021, blackouts sparked an unprecedented outpouring of public anger. Thousands of Cubans took to the streets shouting, 'We are hungry' and 'Freedom!' in a rare challenge to the government. One person was killed and dozens were injured in the protests. According to the Mexico-based human rights organization Justicia 11J, 600 people detained during the unrest remain in prison. In 2022, the island also suffered months of daily hourslong power outages, capped by a nationwide blackout caused by Hurricane Ian.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-set-to-hit-cuba-amid-national-blackout/7829102.html	2024-10-19T23:09:39-07:00	
Cher, Mary J. Blige, Ozzy Osbourne among Rock Hall of Fame inductees	NEW YORK — Cher, Mary J. Blige and Ozzy Osbourne were among this year's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, an elite group formally introduced into the music pantheon Saturday at a star-studded concert gala. Kool & the Gang, Dave Matthews Band, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, and Peter Frampton round out the 2024 class of honorees, artists honored at the ceremony held in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the prestigious hall. Big Mama Thornton, Alexis Korner and John Mayall received special honors for 'musical influence,' as Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield received awards for 'musical excellence.' Suzanne de Passe, a trailblazer for women executives in the music business, who was big in Motown, won the night's award for nonperforming industry professionals. Dua Lipa kicked off the evening with a performance of Believe, with Cher joining the pop star onstage to finish her 1998 smash hit, which was credited as the first song to use auto-tune technology as an instrument. 'I changed the sound of music forever,' she said in her acceptance speech, less than a year after railing against the hall for not having yet added her to the ballot. 'It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was getting in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,' she quipped Saturday night. Performers included Kelly Clarkson, Sammy Hagar, Slash and Demi Lovato, who all appeared for Foreigner. A group of artists including Queen Latifah, De La Soul and Busta Rhymes also performed with the surviving members of the eclectic, pioneering hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest -- Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cher-mary-j-blige-ozzy-osbourne-among-rock-hall-of-fame-inductees/7829095.html	2024-10-19T21:30:07-07:00	
What to know about the electrical grid failure that plunged Cuba into darkness	havana — Millions of people in Cuba were left without electricity for two days after the nation's energy grid went down when of the island's major power plants failed. The widespread blackout that swept across the county was the worst in years. Authorities were able to restore power to some people by Saturday, but it was unclear when the power would be fully restored across the country. Here are a few things to know: What happened and why? About half of Cuba was plunged into darkness on Thursday evening, followed by the entire island on Friday morning after the failure of the Antonio Guiteras thermoelectric plant in Matanzas Province east of Havana. Even in a country that for decades has been accustomed to frequent outages amid a series of economic crises, the grid failure was unprecedented in modern times, aside from incidents involving powerful hurricanes, such as one in 2022. Even as Cuba worked to fix the power problems Saturday, the country issued hurricane watches for the far eastern Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas provinces as a tropical storm developed into Hurricane Oscar, the 10th hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Authorities said the outage that began Thursday stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences' air conditioners — as many as 100,000 additional ones this year alone. They also blamed breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven't been properly maintained because of a lack of hard currency due to U.S. sanctions, as well as insufficient fuel to operate some facilities. Has this happened before? While some homes have spent up to eight hours a day this year without electricity as the grid has grown more unstable, the current power failure is considered Cuba's worst in years. Officials said that 1.64 gigawatts went offline during peak hours, about half the total demand at the time. The government implemented emergency measures to slash demand, suspended classes, and shut down some state-owned workplaces and canceled non-essential services. Another major collapse occurred two years ago after Hurricane Ian, an intense Category 3 storm, damaged power installations and the government took days to fix them. Any political consequences? It's unknown how Cubans will react if the current blackout endures or recurs. But problems in the electrical grid have helped sparked street protests several times in recent years, including large demonstrations in July 2021 that led to international criticism of the government for its harsh response. There were also smaller demonstrations due to blackouts in October 2022 and March of this year. Authorities now say changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are being considered. What's next? Officials said the state-owned power company UNE was using distributed generation to provide power to some areas of the island and that a gas-fired thermoelectric plant was starting operations. Cuba gets its power from huge thermoelectric plants like Antonio Guiteras and some smaller ones, which require crude oil to operate. The country produces about half of the crude needed, but must purchase some of the rest on the international market, which can be difficult and costly due to U.S. sanctions. It has also depended on allies like Venezuela and Russia for cheaper fuel. Authorities have been working since last year on a project to upgrade the island's electrical grid through the use of alternative power sources. A project to build 31 centers generating solar energy is under way and projected to be completed next year. 'We are devoting absolute priority to addressing and solving this highly sensitive energy contingency,' Cuba's President Miguel Díaz-Canel wrote on X. 'There will be no rest until its restoration.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-the-electrical-grid-failure-that-plunged-cuba-into-darkness/7829092.html	2024-10-19T21:07:28-07:00	
Demonstrators in France praise Gisèle Pélicot's courage in harrowing rape trial	PARIS — Women and men demonstrated together Saturday in Paris and other French cities in support of Gisèle Pélicot and against sexual violence highlighted by the harrowing trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men accused of rapes while she was drugged and unconscious. The demonstrations outside Paris' criminal court, in the southeastern city of Lyon and elsewhere underscored how Pélicot's courage in speaking out about her ordeal is inspiring people in France and beyond, even as they've been horrified by the scale and brutality of the abuse she suffered over the course of a decade. Since the September 2 beginning of the extraordinary trial, during which Pélicot has faced 51 of her alleged rapists, she has been praised for her composure and decision to keep the hearings public — after the court initially suggested that they be held behind closed doors. 'She has decided to make this an emblematic trial,' said Elsa Labouret, one of the Paris demonstrators and a spokesperson for the women's group 'Osez le féminisme!' (Dare to be feminist!) 'Victims don't have to do what she did. They have a right to have their anonymity protected. It's not necessarily a duty of any victim. But what she decided to do is very, very important because now we cannot ignore the violence that some men can resort to,' she said. Demonstrators denounced what they said is laxity from the French justice system toward sexual violence and fears of being raped and assaulted that they said stalk women day-in, day-out. Placards they held up read: 'Shame must change sides,' 'Stop the denial,' 'Not your punching ball' and 'We are all Gisele. Are you all Dominique???' Dominique Pélicot admitted during the trial that for nearly a decade, he repeatedly drugged his unwitting wife and invited dozens of men to rape her while she lay unconscious in their bed. He told the court that he also raped Gisèle and that the 50 other men also standing trial understood exactly what they were doing. She has divorced him since his arrest. The trial is expected to run until December. The defendants range in age from 26 to 74. Many of them deny having raped Gisèle Pélicot, saying her then-husband manipulated them or that they believed she was consenting. 'You can never know who is a rapist or who is a monster. Like, it could be your neighbor, it could be anyone,' said Paris demonstrator Khalil Ndiaye, a student. 'It's really disgusting somehow to think that it could be people that you know, people that you hang out with every day and, like, they could do things like that.' He said he regards Gisèle Pélicot as an icon. 'Because in her pain, she decided not to give up and not to just lie down,' he said. 'She decided to fight. And we're all here today because she's fighting and she's inspiring us to fight, too.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/demonstrators-in-france-praise-gis%c3%a8le-p%c3%a9licot-s-courage-in-harrowing-rape-trial-/7829091.html	2024-10-19T20:56:14-07:00	
6-time Olympic cycling champion Hoy reveals he has terminal cancer	Britain's six-time Olympic track cycling champion Chris Hoy has revealed he has 'two to four years' to live after he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer which metastasized to his bones. The announcement comes after the 48-year-old Scot said in February he was feeling 'optimistic and positive' as he was undergoing treatment for an unspecified cancer diagnosed last year. However, the sprinter, who worked as a pundit with the BBC at last summer's Paris Games, has now revealed he has known for more than a year that his cancer is incurable. Despite his illness, Hoy says he remains positive and appreciating life. 'Hand on heart, I'm pretty positive most of the time and I have genuine happiness,' Hoy told The Times. 'This is bigger than the Olympics. It's bigger than anything. This is about appreciating life and finding joy.' 'As unnatural as it feels, this is nature. You know, we were all born and we all die, and this is just part of the process.' Hoy wrote a memoir about his life over the past year in which he describes how doctors discovered his cancer after initially finding a tumor in his shoulder. The father of two also said he had an allergic reaction to his chemotherapy treatment, feeling 'completely devastated at the end of it.' On top of his own treatment, Hoy was dealt another blow when his wife Sarra Kemp was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in November. 'But you remind yourself, aren't I lucky that there is medicine I can take that will fend this off for as long as possible,' an optimistic Hoy said. 'I'm not just saying these words. I've learnt to live in the moment, and I have days of genuine joy and happiness.' 'It's absolutely not denial or self-delusion. It's about trying to recognize, what do we have control over? 'The fear and anxiety, it all comes from trying to predict the future. But the future is this abstract concept in our minds. None of us know what's going to happen. The one thing we know is we've got a finite time on the planet.' Hoy was at the vanguard of Britain's era of domination in track cycling, winning gold medals at the Athens, Beijing and London Olympics. He also claimed 11 world titles during a glittering career. Until 2021 Hoy was the most successful British Olympian and the most successful Olympic cyclist of all time before being overtaken by fellow Briton Jason Kenny who claimed his seventh Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games.	https://www.voanews.com/a/time-olympic-cycling-champion-hoy-reveals-he-has-terminal-cancer/7829090.html	2024-10-19T20:45:28-07:00	
US probes unauthorized release of classified documents on Israel attack plans	WASHINGTON — The U.S. is investigating an unauthorized release of classified documents that assess Israel's plans to attack Iran, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press. A fourth U.S. official said the documents appear to be legitimate. The documents are attributed to the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and note that Israel continues to move military assets in place to conduct a military strike in response to Iran's blistering ballistic missile attack on October 1. They were sharable within the 'Five Eyes,' which are the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The documents, which are marked top secret, were posted online to Telegram and first reported by CNN and Axios news outlets. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The investigation is also examining how the documents were obtained — including whether it was an intentional leak by a member of the U.S. intelligence community or obtained by another method, such as a hack — and whether any other intelligence information was compromised, one of the officials said. As part of that investigation, officials are working to determine who had access to the documents before they were posted, the official said. The documents emerged as the U.S. has urged Israel to take advantage of its elimination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and press for a cease-fire in Gaza, and has likewise urgently cautioned Israel not to further expand military operations in the north in Lebanon and risk a wider regional war. However, Israel's leadership has repeatedly stressed it will not let Iran's missile attack go unanswered. Hamas and Hezbollah, in Lebanon, have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was aware of the reports of the documents but did not have further comment. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7829073.html	2024-10-19T19:14:09-07:00	
Former special forces commander Prabowo to take up Indonesian presidency	JAKARTA, indonesia — Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Sunday will take over as president of the world's third-largest democracy after sweeping the country's election with policies like free meals for school children and with the outgoing leader's son as his running mate. The 73-year-old former special forces commander won the February 14 contest with nearly 60% of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition. Prabowo will officially become Indonesia's eighth president Sunday morning after he is sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesia's parliament, flanked by outgoing President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo. Prabowo, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, is expected to give a speech to lawmakers at the parliament's upper house after the swearing-in and before heading to the presidential palace. He will be joined by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of Jokowi. As they make their way to the palace, they will be greeted by thousands of supporters expected to throng Jakarta streets that are lined with posters of the incoming leader. Prabowo and Gibran are expected to stop at seven stages that have been set up along the way between parliament and the palace, Nusron Wahid, a Prabowo aide, told reporters Friday. Jokowi supporters are also expected to attend the celebrations and bid farewell to Indonesia's outgoing leader. After two terms and a decade in power, Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development. Critics say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions. Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. Prabowo is expected to meet with foreign dignitaries, including about 20 heads of state, later Sunday at the presidential palace, said Hasan Nasbi, the head of the presidential communications organization. China said it is sending Vice President Han Zheng to the inauguration. The delegation from the United States is being led by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. During his campaign, Prabowo billed himself to voters and investors alike as the 'continuity candidate.' He has set a target to accelerate economic growth to 8% from a current rate of 5%, pledged to make Indonesia self-sufficient in production of staples, and signaled a more active role on the global stage. Past allegations against Prabowo of involvement in the kidnapping of student activists and human rights abuses in Papua and East Timor, however, have also raised concern about Indonesia's trajectory of democracy, human rights advocates say. Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from the decades-long authoritarian rule of former President Suharto.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-special-forces-commander-prabowo-to-take-up-indonesian-presidency/7829066.html	2024-10-19T17:52:12-07:00	
Polio crisis deepens as Pakistan reports new cases	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Saturday that two children in its southern Sindh province had been paralyzed by poliovirus, bringing the total number of cases nationwide to 39 for the year since March, when officials confirmed the first case. The South Asian nation of around 240 million people reported six cases of paralytic poliovirus infections in 2023, following a period of more than a year without any documented cases, only to see the numbers rise again. 'Genetic sequencing of the cases is under way,' said a Pakistan polio eradication program statement Saturday while reporting the two new infections in Sindh. 'The intense virus transmission and increase in polio cases are indicative of the harm that children suffer when they miss opportunities for vaccination.' Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, with at least 20 cases this year, are the only two countries where the crippling disease is still endemic. Pakistani officials are preparing to launch a nationwide vaccination campaign on October 28 to immunize more than 45 million children under 5 against the paralytic disease. 'It is critical for parents to open their doors to vaccinators during this drive and ensure that all children in their care receive two drops of the crucial oral polio vaccine to keep them protected from the devastating effects of polio,' the program emphasized in its Saturday statement. Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province, which sits on the Afghan border, has reported 20 polio cases in 2024, while Sindh has detected 12 cases. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has documented five paralytic poliovirus cases. Pakistan’s most populous Punjab province and the national capital, Islamabad, reported one case each. The resurgence of poliovirus in Pakistan is blamed on boycotts of vaccination drives by parents in rural areas who allege the initiatives are a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Anti-state militants in violence-hit districts bordering Afghanistan occasionally attack vaccinators and their police escorts, suspecting them of spying for the government. The violence has claimed the lives of dozens of security forces and vaccinators. An independent monitoring board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative noted in a report last month that more than 420,000 Pakistani children could not be inoculated in anti-polio campaigns in 2024. The board reported more than 200 boycotts of the polio vaccination campaign in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa last year. 'It is disturbing to realize that violence, insecurity, and boycotts are still as prevalent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as they were in 2023,' the report said. It highlighted that residents in several impoverished districts of Pakistan also demanded electricity, gas supply, and road construction in return for getting their children vaccinated. A representative for Pakistan’s Ministry of Health told a World Health Organization meeting in Doha, Qatar, earlier this week that polio eradication is the country’s 'top priority,' and efforts have been intensified to halt virus transmission. 'Despite recent resurgence, a unified plan with provinces aims to stop polio transmission by 2025,' Safi Malik stated. 'We're focusing on quality campaigns, digital tracking of missed areas, and a strong Pakistan-Afghanistan collaboration for cross-border vaccinations,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polio-crisis-deepens-as-pakistan-reports-new-cases/7829062.html	2024-10-19T17:31:41-07:00	
7 dead after ferry dock gangway collapses on Georgia's Sapelo Island	SAVANNAH, Georgia — At least seven people were killed Saturday after part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgia's Sapelo Island, authorities said. Multiple people were taken to hospitals, and crews from the U.S. Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to spokesperson Tyler Jones of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which operates the dock. Jones said a gangway at the dock collapsed and sent people plunging into the water. It happened as crowds gathered on the island for a celebration of its tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. 'There have been seven fatalities confirmed,' Jones said. 'There have been multiple people transported to area hospitals, and we are continuing to search the water for individuals.' Jones said he did not know what caused the gangway to collapse, but officials believe there were at least 20 people on it at the time. The gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another dock onshore. Among the dead was a chaplain for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Jones said. Sapelo Island is about 97 kilometers south of Savannah and is reachable from the mainland by boat. Cultural Day is an annual fall event spotlighting the island’s tiny community of Hogg Hummock, which is home to a few dozen Black residents. The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded by former slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding. Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the South — known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia — are scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and weaving baskets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-after-ferry-dock-gangway-collapses-on-georgia-s-sapelo-island/7829061.html	2024-10-19T17:18:54-07:00	
North Korea FM calls new US-led sanctions monitoring team unlawful	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea's foreign minister said a new multilateral sanctions monitoring team led by the United States was 'utterly unlawful and illegitimate,' state media said Sunday. The United States, South Korea and Japan on Wednesday announced the launch of a new multinational team to monitor the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea after Russia and China thwarted monitoring activities at the United Nations. The team was introduced after Russia in March rejected the annual renewal of a U.N. panel of experts that had over the past 15 years overseen the implementation of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. China abstained from the vote. 'The forces involved in the smear campaign against the DPRK will have to pay a dear price for it,' Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said via state news agency KCNA, using the country's official name. Choe criticized the team, which would be joined by eight other countries, as Washington's misconduct of flouting the international order and as 'the most undisguised violation' of North Korea's sovereignty. Washington and Seoul have warned of North Korea's close military ties with Moscow. South Korea's spy agency said Friday that North Korea has shipped 1,500 special forces troops to Russia's Far East for training and acclimatizing at local military bases and will likely be deployed for combat in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he could not confirm reports that North Korea has sent troops to Russia ahead of what could be a deployment to Ukraine, but added such a move would be concerning, if true.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fm-calls-new-us-led-sanctions-monitoring-team-unlawful/7829058.html	2024-10-19T17:10:35-07:00	
German police arrest Libyan suspected of planning attack on Israeli embassy	German police have arrested a Libyan suspected of belonging to the Islamic State group and of having planned an attack on the Israeli embassy, federal prosecutors told Agence France-Presse on Saturday. 'There is some suggestion he had planned an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin,' said a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, adding that the suspect was also thought to be affiliated with the Islamic State group. Bild daily reported that police commandoes had stormed a flat in Bernau, north of Berlin, in the evening and arrested the 28-year-old man. The newspaper said German authorities had acted on a tip-off from a foreign intelligence agency. Israel's ambassador to Berlin, Ron Prosor, thanked German authorities for 'ensuring the security of our embassy' in a message on the social media platform X. Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip, German authorities have increased their vigilance against Islamist militant threats and the resurgence of anti-Semitism, like in many countries around the world. In early September, Munich police shot dead a young Austrian man known for his links to radical Islamism after he opened fire at the Israeli consulate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-arrest-libyan-suspected-of-planning-attack-on-israeli-embassy-/7828866.html	2024-10-19T17:09:26-07:00	
Ukraine repels Russian aerial attack on Kyiv	Ukraine's military deployed air-defense systems late Saturday to repel an aerial assault on Kyiv, according to the capital's top elected official. 'Stay in shelters!' Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the scope of the aerial assault. Saturday's attack follows a visit to the city by French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who said a Ukrainian defeat would mean 'chaos' for the international order. According to Agence France-Presse, Barrot's speech came hours after Russian forces issued a statement claiming that they'd captured another village in the country's east. Barrot's visit, aimed at underlining Paris' unflinching support for Ukraine, comes at the end of a week in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled his 'victory plan' to defeat Russia, again calling for beefed-up Western backing. 'A Russian victory would consecrate the law of the strongest and precipitate the international order towards chaos,' said Barrot, who also warned that recent reports of North Korean regular troops supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, if verified, would constitute a serious escalation of the war. France's top diplomat also said Paris was open to the idea of an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, but that talks would continue on the subject with allies. Barrot's stop in Kyiv coincided with the G7 defense ministerial meeting in Naples, Italy, which saw a pledge of 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, including vows of military aid, according to a final statement. 'We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,' read the group's final statement following the one-day summit. Information in this report is from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-repels-russian-aerial-attack-on-kyiv/7828862.html	2024-10-19T16:16:43-07:00	
Mail carriers reach tentative contract with USPS for raises, air-conditioned trucks	Some 200,000 mail carriers have reached a tentative contract deal with the U.S. Postal Service that includes backdated pay raises and a promise to provide workers with air-conditioned trucks. The new agreement, which still needs to be ratified by union members, runs through November 2026. Letter deliverers have been working without a contract since May 2023. Both the union and the Postal Service welcomed the agreement, which was announced Friday. 'Both sides didn't get everything they wanted. But by bargaining in good faith, we ended with an agreement that meets our goals and rewards our members,' Brian Renfroe, the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, told The Associated Press. 'To make that happen, the Postal Service had to recognize the contributions of members to the Postal Service and the American people.' Among other improvements, the deal increases the top pay and reduces the amount of time it takes new workers to reach that level, Renfroe said. He credited Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and his deputy for bargaining in good faith throughout the arduous process. The Postal Service said the agreement supported its 10-year 'Delivering for America' mission to modernize operations and adapt to changing customer needs. 'This is a fair and responsible agreement that serves the best interest of our employees, our customers and the future of the Postal Service,' said Doug Tulino, the deputy postmaster general and chief human resources officer. As part of the agreement, all city carriers will get three annual pay increases of 1.3% each by 2025, some of which will be paid retroactively from November 2023. Workers will also receive retroactive and future cost-of-living There is also a commitment from the Postal Service to 'make every effort' to provide mail trucks with air-conditioning. The Postal Service in summer began rolling out its new electric delivery vehicles, which come equipped with air-conditioning. While the trucks won't win any beauty contests, they did get rave reviews from letter carriers accustomed to older vehicles that lack modern safety features and are prone to breaking down — and even catching fire. Within a few years, the new delivery fleet will have expanded to 60,000, most of them electric models, serving as the Postal Service's primary delivery truck from Maine to Hawaii. Under the tentative contract agreement, the Postal Service must discuss with the union any plans to buy new mail trucks that don't have air-conditioning. This is the second contract negotiated since DeJoy was appointed postmaster general in 2020. It is expected to take several weeks for union members to ratify the contract. Rural mail deliverers aren't covered by the contract because they are represented by a different union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mail-carriers-reach-tentative-contract-with-usps-for-pay-raises-air-conditioned-trucks-/7828853.html	2024-10-19T15:13:59-07:00	
Germany says Britain taking lead on possible Eurofighters for Turkey	istanbul — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday that a project to possibly supply Turkey with Eurofighter jets was an effort being driven by Britain and was in the early stages. 'It is something that will continue to develop, but is now being driven forward from there [Britain],' he said when asked about potential movement on the issue at a press conference in Istanbul with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The Eurofighter Typhoon jets are built by a consortium of Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain, represented by companies Airbus AIR.PA, BAE Systems BAES.L and Leonardo LDOF.MI. Asked about the subject, a British government spokesperson said, 'We continue to make progress on the potential export of Eurofighter Typhoon to Türkiye, an important NATO ally. 'When considering any potential export of Eurofighter, we work closely with the governments of Germany, Italy and Spain, in line with the commitments each nation has made to support the others' exports,' the spokesperson added. Ankara said last year it was in talks with Britain and Spain to buy Eurofighter Typhoons, though Germany objected to the idea. Since then, it has complained of a lack of progress on the issue and Erdogan alluded to Berlin's reluctance until now. 'We wish to leave behind some of the difficulties experienced in the past in the supply of defense industry products and develop our cooperation,' Erdogan told reporters at the press conference in Istanbul. On Thursday a Turkish defense ministry official said Turkey had been conducting technical work aimed at accelerating its planned purchase of the jets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-says-britain-taking-lead-on-possible-eurofighters-for-turkey-/7828844.html	2024-10-19T14:48:23-07:00	
Tiny' Hurricane Oscar forms off Bahamas	miami, florida — Hurricane Oscar formed Saturday off the coast of the Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. It characterized the storm as 'tiny.' The government of the Bahamas has issued a hurricane warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The government of Cuba has issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, and Las Tunas. Locally heavy rainfall is expected across the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas later Saturday, according to the latest advisory. Heavy rain is expected to spread to eastern Cuba on Sunday. The storm's maximum sustained winds were clocked at 80 miles per hour (130 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts. Its center was located about 165 miles (260 kilometers) east-southeast of the southeastern Bahamas and about 470 miles (755 kilometers) east of Camaguey, Cuba. Hours earlier, Tropical Storm Nadine formed off Mexico's southern Caribbean coast and was moving inland across Belize. Heavy rain and tropical storm conditions were occurring over parts of Belize and the Yucatan peninsula. A tropical storm warning is in effect for Belize City and from Belize to Cancun, Mexico, including the popular tourist destination, Cozumel. The hurricane center said Nadine was located about 20 miles (35 kilometers) east of Belize City, with winds of 13 mph (20 kph). Its maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph (85 kph). Nadine was expected to move across Belize, northern Guatemala, and southern Mexico through Sunday, the center added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiny-hurricane-forms-off-bahamas-/7828837.html	2024-10-19T14:29:58-07:00	
Mexican navy says it seizes 8.3 tons of drugs in Pacific	Mexico City, Mexico — The Mexican navy announced Friday it had seized more than 8.3 tons of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea. 'Navy personnel seized 8,361 kilograms of illicit cargo, which represents the largest amount of drugs seized in a maritime operation, unprecedented in history,' said a statement from the Ministry of the Navy. It did not specify the type of the drugs, but said they were valued at about $105 million. Twenty-three people were arrested during the bust which took place southwest of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, off the western coast of Mexico. The drugs were distributed in six small boats and one of the vessels was a submersible, which implied a 'complex' action on the part of the sailors, added the ministry. The largest drug seizure in Mexico's history was 23 tons of Colombian cocaine in November 2007. Mexico has for decades been the hub of drug trafficking to the United States, with many cartels fighting for control of the trade. The state of Michoacan, off the coast of which the seizure took place, is the scene of clashes between criminal gangs, including the powerful Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal groups. The latest raid reported Friday was carried out 'days ago' by surface units backed by a helicopter, the ministry said. Some 8,700 liters of fuel, another of the illicit trades controlled by drug cartels, were also found on the raided vessels. On August 23, authorities reported they had impounded about 7 tons of drugs in two separate operations in the same area of the country. The Mexican navy, which conducts surveillance operations on a permanent basis, has discovered all kinds of drug shipments, including one of cocaine stuffed in 217 barrels of chili sauce in 2016. Mexico has for decades been a drug trafficking route to the United States, which has sparked disputes between different NARCO groups. The country's first woman president Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office on October 1, faces a major challenge to tackle the drug cartels and related crimes. She has pledged to stick with her predecessor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's 'hugs not bullets' strategy of using social policy to tackle crime at its roots. Across Mexico, more than 450,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have gone missing in a spiral of violence since the government deployed the army to combat drug trafficking in 2006.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-navy-says-it-seizes-8-3-tons-of-drugs-in-pacific-/7828829.html	2024-10-19T13:59:16-07:00	
Video published by Ukraine purports to show North Korean soldiers in Russia	kyiv, ukraine — A video purporting to show dozens of North Korean recruits lining up to collect Russian military fatigues and gear aims to intimidate Ukrainian forces and marks a new chapter in the 2 1/2-year war with the introduction of another country into the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said. The video, which was obtained by Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which operates under the Culture and Information Ministry, is said to show North Korean soldiers standing in line to pick up bags, clothes and other apparel from Russian servicemen. The Associated Press could not verify the video independently. 'We received this video from our own sources. We cannot provide additional verification from the sources who provided it to us due to security concerns,' said Ihor Solovey, head of the center. 'The video clearly shows North Korean citizens being given Russian uniforms under the direction of the Russian military,' he said. 'For Ukraine, this video is important because it is the first video evidence that shows North Korea participating in the war on the side of Russia. Now not only with weapons and shells but also with personnel.' The center claims the footage was shot by a Russian soldier in recent days. The location is unknown. It comes after the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said in local media reports that about 11,000 North Korean infantrymen were currently training in eastern Russia. He predicted they would be ready to join the fighting by November. At least 2,600 would be sent to Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August, he was quoted as saying. 'The emergence of any number of new soldiers is a problem because we will simply need new, additional weapons to destroy them all,' Solovey told AP. 'The dissemination of this video is important as a signal to the world community that with two countries officially at war against Ukraine, we will need more support to repel this aggression.' The presence of North Korean soldiers in Ukraine, if true, would be another proof of intensified military ties between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last summer, they signed a strategic partnership treaty that commits both countries to provide military assistance. North Korean weapons have already been used in the Ukraine war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/video-published-by-ukraine-purports-to-show-north-korean-soldiers-in-russia/7828824.html	2024-10-19T13:22:09-07:00	
Somalia military strikes major blow to al-Shabab, kills 30 militants	Somalia's Information Ministry said Saturday the country's military is targeting al-Shabab militants in the Galmudug region of central Somalia and is making progress in eroding the group's operational effectiveness. In a coordinated military operation, the Somali National Army, or SNA, supported by Galmudug State forces and pro-government local clan militias, killed 30 al-Shabab militants and injured dozens more, according to a government statement released Saturday. 'The Somali National Army killed 30 al-Shabab militants and injured 40 others after conducting an operation at the Qeycad location in the southern Mudug region for the past 48 hours,' the statement reads. Somali authorities say the operation was conducted after the army received intelligence regarding al-Shabab militants' maneuvers in the region. The government says three of its soldiers were injured during the operation. Witnesses in Qeycad, near Ba'adweyn town in the Mudug region, said an intense gunbattle between the two sides lasted several hours, inflicting substantial damage on the militants. 'The fight lasted for hours, and the terrorists were heavily damaged, and the Somali National Army took over the area, and the group's strongholds in the area were also destroyed during the operation,' the government statement said. During the engagement, several al-Shabab commanders surrendered to the SNA. Among those were two significant militant leaders, 'Mohamed Bashir Muse and Madey Fodey,' according to the government report. This military action follows an incident two days prior when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vest outside a crowded restaurant in Mogadishu, resulting in the deaths of at least seven people. The operation also occurred concurrently with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's official visit to Kampala, Uganda, where he aimed to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance regional security cooperation with President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. 'The president will discuss with his counterpart, President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, focusing on strengthening bilateral relations between Somalia and Uganda, fostering enhanced regional security and stability cooperation,' a brief Somali National News Agency announcement stated. As Somalia navigates ongoing diplomatic disagreements with Ethiopia — particularly regarding a maritime agreement signed with Somaliland, a breakaway region — its government has sought closer ties with Egypt and Eritrea, both of which have historical disputes with Ethiopia. Earlier this month, leaders from Egypt, Somalia, and Eritrea convened in Asmara, reinforcing what analysts describe as an emerging 'axis against Ethiopia.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-military-strikes-major-blow-to-al-shabab-kills-30-militants/7828814.html	2024-10-19T12:57:12-07:00	
Calls grow for information on health of Cameroon’s leader	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Concern is growing in Cameroon about 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who has not been seen in public for more than 40 days. Biya has not yet returned to Cameroon more than a week after state officials said he would be back from Geneva, following rumors of his death. Several groups say Biya's long absence suggests he is not healthy enough to be president. Biya was last seen in public on September 8, while leaving Beijing, where he attended the Africa-China forum in the company of world leaders, a few of his collaborators and his wife, Chantal Biya. Civilians say they suspect Biya is not in good health and is receiving treatment wherever he is. Opposition and civil society groups say Biya should be in the country to lead the nation amid multiple challenges, including a prolonged separatist crisis that has claimed more than 6,000 lives in the country's western regions. Government troops are fighting Boko Haram terrorists on the northern border with Chad and Nigeria, and rebels are fleeing to eastern Cameroon from armed conflicts in the neighboring Central African Republic. Tamfu Richard, a human rights lawyer and a member of the Cameroon Party for National Reconciliation, or CPNR, said he has delivered a petition to National Assembly Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril to inform Cameroon's constitutional council of what he says is a vacancy created by Biya's absence. 'I am simply requesting the president [speaker] of the National Assembly to exercise a constitutional right, which is to refer the vacancy [Biya's long absence] to the constitutional council,' Richard said. 'According to the [Cameroon] constitution, the seat of institutions is in Yaounde, and if the president of the republic is out of Cameroon, not on an official visit or for justifiable reasons, it could be that the president of the republic has absconded from his place of work.' VOA could not independently verify if Richard’s petition has been received by the speaker of the national assembly, but copies of the document have been widely circulated on social media. On October 9, government officials said social and mainstream media reports that Biya was dead were unfounded. They said Biya was alive and in excellent health and was to return to Cameroon soon. When reports aired calling for Biya's whereabouts to be made public and saying civilians want to see their president, Territorial Administration Minister Paul Atanga Nji banned the media from discussing Biya's health. Nji ordered authorities to monitor all media to make sure violators are charged for illegally discussing top security issues. Ndi Eugene Ndi, president of the Yaounde chapter of the Cameroon Association of English Speaking Journalists, or CAMASEJ, says most media ignore the ban. 'The press should be free to talk about the president’s health,' Ndi said. 'The citizens have to know where the president is through the media.' Biya has ruled Cameroon for more than four decades. Opposition parties say he rules with an iron fist and wants to keep power until he dies. Biya has always claimed he won all elections after he constitutionally took power from Ahmadou Ahidjo, Cameroon’s first president, in 1982. Ahidjo resigned after complaining of his failing health.	https://www.voanews.com/a/calls-grow-for-information-on-health-of-cameroon-s-leader/7828766.html	2024-10-19T10:50:22-07:00	
Last US in-person vote will be cast in Alaska's Aleutian Islands	ANCHORAGE, ALASKA — On a desolate slab of island tundra in western Alaska, a resident of Adak will again become the last American to cast an in-person ballot for president, continuing a 12-year tradition for the nation’s westernmost community. The honor of having the last voter in the nation fell to Adak when they did away with absentee-only voting for the 2012 election and added in-person voting. 'People have a little bit of fun on that day because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election’s decided way before we’re closed,' said city manager Layton Lockett. 'But, you know, it’s still fun.' When polls close in Adak, it will be 1 a.m. on the East Coast. Adak Island, midway in the Aleutian Island chain and bordered by the Bering Sea to the north and the North Pacific Ocean to the south, is closer to Russia than mainland Alaska. The island best known as a former World War II military base and later naval station is 1,931 kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Anchorage and farther west than Hawaii, where polls close an hour earlier. Mary Nelson said Republican Mitt Romney was likely conceding the 2012 race to President Barack Obama on election night when she became Adak’s first last voter in a presidential election, although she didn’t know Obama had been reelected until the next morning when she turned on her computer to read election results. Nelson, who now lives in Washington state, recalled to The Associated Press by telephone that she was a poll worker in Adak at the time and had forgotten to vote until just before the 8 p.m. poll closing time. 'When I opened the [voting booth's] curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture and announced that I was the last person in Adak to vote,' she said. That was also the end of the celebration since they still had work to do. 'We had votes to count, and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,' she said. There are U.S. territories farther west than Alaska, but there’s no process in the Electoral College to allow residents in Guam, the northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands to vote for president, according to the National Archives. 'I’ve been tickled pink and told people about it,' said Nelson, now 73. 'I have the story I printed out about it and show some people who I think would think it’s a big deal, like my family,' she said. Adak Island has historical significance for its role in World War II. The U.S. built facilities on the island after Japanese forces took islands farther west in the Aleutian chain. Troops landed in August 1942, to begin building an Army base, and enemy planes dropped nine bombs on the island two months later, but in undeveloped areas, and riddled the landscape with machine gun fire. The Navy began building facilities in January 1943. In May 1943, about 27,000 combat troops gathered on Adak as a staging point to retake nearby Attu Island from the Japanese. Among famous Americans stationed at Adak were writers Dashiell Hammett and Gore Vidal. The island also played host to President Franklin Roosevelt, boxing champion Joe Lewis and several Hollywood stars, according to the Adak Historical Society. In a lighter note, the Army attempted to start a forest on Adak Island between 1943 and 1945. A sign placed by residents in the 1960s outside the area of 33 trees noted: 'You are now Entering and Leaving the Adak National Forest.' After the war, the island was transferred to the Air Force and then the Navy in 1950. Nearly 32,000 hectares (80,000 acres) of the 73,000-hectare (180,000-acre) island were set aside for Navy use, and the rest of the island remained part of what eventually became the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The base closed in 1997. The Navy retains about 2,300 hectares (5,600 acres) with the remainder either owned by the Aleut Corporation, the Alaska Native regional corporation for the area; the city of Adak; or the refuge. Lockett said the city is facing tough times with a dwindling population and lack of an economic driver. The town’s fish processing plant has closed numerous times over the years. When the base was active, there were about 6,000 residents on Adak Island. The 2020 Census counted 171 residents. Lockett says that’s probably now down to below 50 full-time residents. In Alaska, a school must have 10 students to remain open. Mike Hanley, the Aleutian Region School District superintendent, said in an email that the school closed in 2023 after it started the year with six students. That shrank to one by November, and then that student left. Hanley said by the time he notified the state education department, 'there were literally no children on the island, not even younger pre-K students.' When it comes to politics, Lockett said it’s pretty easy in a small town to know where your neighbors fall politically, but there seems to be one goal that unites everyone. Whoever is in office, are they going to try to 'encourage the military to come back to Adak in some way, shape or form?' he said. 'We’re kind of in that great midst of, what’s next for Adak, because we’re struggling,' he said. For now, with the presidential election coming up, the city can focus on its unique place in America. 'I’m not sure who the last voter will be this year,' said Adak City Clerk Jana Lekanoff. 'Maybe it’ll be a bit of a competition?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/last-us-in-person-vote-will-be-cast-in-alaska-s-aleutian-islands/7828757.html	2024-10-19T10:35:10-07:00	
Judges punishing Jan. 6 rioters fear more political violence as election nears	WASHINGTON — Over the past four years, judges at Washington’s federal courthouse have punished hundreds of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in an unprecedented assault on the nation's democracy. On the cusp of the next presidential election, some of those judges fear another burst of political violence could be coming. Before recently sentencing a rioter to prison, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said he prays Americans accept the outcome of next month’s election. But the veteran judge expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are spreading the same sort of conspiracy theories that fueled the mob's January 6, 2021, riot. 'That sore loser is saying the same things he said before,' Walton said earlier this month without mentioning the Republican presidential nominee by name. 'He’s riling up the troops again, so if he doesn’t get what he wants, it’s not inconceivable that we will experience that same situation again. And who knows? It could be worse.' 'It scares me' Walton, a nominee of President George W. Bush, is not alone. Other judges have said the political climate is ripe for another attack like the one that injured more than 100 police officers at the Capitol. As Election Day nears, judges are frequently stressing the need to send a message beyond their courtrooms that political violence can't be tolerated. 'It scares me to think about what will happen if anyone on either side is not happy with the results of the election,' Judge Jia Cobb, a nominee of President Joe Biden, said during a sentencing hearing last month for four Capitol rioters. Judge Rudolph Contreras lamented the potential for more politically motivated violence as he sentenced a Colorado man, Jeffrey Sabol, who helped other rioters drag a police officer into the mob. Sabol later told FBI agents that a 'call to battle was announced' and that he had 'answered the call because he was a patriot warrior.' 'It doesn’t take much imagination to imagine a similar call coming out in the coming months, and the court would be concerned that Mr. Sabol would answer that call in the same way,' Contreras, a President Barack Obama nominee, said in March before sentencing Sabol to more than five years in prison. Trump’s distortion of the January 6 attack has been a cornerstone of his bid to reclaim the White House. The former president has denied any responsibility for the crimes of supporters who smashed windows, assaulted police officers and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Biden's 2020 victory. 'Patriots' and 'hostages' Trump has vowed to pardon rioters, whom he calls 'patriots' and 'hostages,' if he wins in November. And he said he would accept the results of the upcoming election only if it’s 'free and fair,' casting doubts reminiscent of his baseless claims in 2020. Judges have repeatedly used their platform on the bench to denounce those efforts to downplay the violence on January 6 and cast the rioters as political prisoners. And some have raised concerns about what such rhetoric means for the future of the country and its democracy. 'We’re in a real difficult time in our country, and I hope we can survive it,' Walton said this month while sentencing a Tennessee nurse who used a pair of medical scissors to smash a glass door at the Capitol. 'I’ve got a young daughter, I’ve got a young grandson, and I would like for America to be available to them and be as good to them as it has been to me,' he said. 'But I don’t know if we survive with the mentality that took place that day.' More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the January 6 siege, which disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power for the first time in the nation’s history. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years. Justice Department prosecutors have argued in many cases that a prison sentence is necessary to deter convicted Capitol rioters from engaging in more politically motivated violence. 'With the 2024 presidential election approaching and many loud voices in the media and online continuing to sow discord and distrust, the potential for a repeat of January 6 looms ominously,' prosecutors have repeatedly warned in court filings. 'I'd do it all over again' Prosecutors argue that defendants who have shown little or no remorse for their actions on January 6 could break the law again. Some rioters even seem to be proud of their crimes. The first rioter to enter the Capitol texted his mother, 'I’ll go again given the opportunity.' A man from Washington state who stormed the Capitol with fellow Proud Boys extremist group members told a judge, 'You can give me 100 years, and I’d do it all over again.' A Kentucky nurse who joined the riot told a television interviewer that she would 'do it again tomorrow.' A Colorado woman known to her social media followers as the 'J6 praying grandma' avoided a prison sentence in August when a magistrate judge sentenced her for disorderly conduct and trespassing on Capitol grounds. Rebecca Lavrenz told the judge that God, not Trump, led her to Washington on January 6. 'And she has all but promised to do it all over again,' said prosecutor Terence Parker. Prosecutors had sought 10 months behind bars. After her April trial conviction, Lavrenz went on a 'media blitz' to defend the mob, spread misinformation, undermine confidence in the courts and boost her celebrity in a community that believes January 6 'was a good day for this country,' Parker said. Magistrate Zia Faruqui sentenced Lavrenz to six months of home confinement and fined her $103,000, stressing the need to 'lower the volume' before the next election. 'These outside influences, the people that are tearing our country apart, they’re not going to help you,' Faruqui told her.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judges-punishing-jan-6-rioters-fear-more-political-violence-as-election-nears/7828752.html	2024-10-19T10:15:07-07:00	
Boeing makes new offer to union in hopes of ending strike	Boeing and the union representing striking machinists have negotiated a new contract proposal that would provide bigger pay raises and bonuses in a bid to end a costly walkout that has crippled production of airplanes for more than a month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said early Saturday that it plans to hold a ratification vote Wednesday. The union said the deal would increase pay by 35% over four years, up from 30% that was offered last month. It also boosts upfront bonuses to $7,000 per worker instead of $6,000. The new offer would not restore a traditional pension plan — a key demand of the 33,000 striking workers — but it would increase the amount of contributions to 401(k) retirement plans that Boeing would match, the union said. 'We look forward to our employees voting on the negotiated proposal,' Boeing said in a statement. About 33,000 members of IAM District 751 began a strike on September 14. The strike has halted production of Boeing 737s, including the 737 Max, and 767s and 777s. Boeing is continuing to build 787 Dreamliners at a nonunion plant in South Carolina. The strike has led new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg to announce about 17,000 layoffs and take early steps toward raising up to $25 billion from new stock or debt to bolster the company's finances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-makes-new-offer-to-union-in-hopes-of-ending-strike/7828740.html	2024-10-19T09:54:25-07:00	
Tropical Storm Nadine sweeps across Belize, dumps rains on Mexico	BELIZE CITY — Tropical Storm Nadine swirled across Belize on Saturday morning, bringing heavy rain and strong wind to the Central American nation and the neighboring Yucatan Peninsula to the north in Mexico. From there, the storm was expected to push into northern Guatemala and Mexico's southeastern states of Chiapas and Tabasco, a forecast from the U.S.-based National Hurricane Center predicted. Nadine began lashing Belize with rain Friday night, with showers and thunderstorms, chief meteorologist Ronald Gordon told Reuters. By Saturday morning, the storm had passed over Belize's Half Moon Caye on the Lighthouse Reef Atoll. The NHC's tropical storm warning stretches from Belize City to Mexican beach resorts Cancun and Cozumel. In Belize, low-lying bridges and sections of the Coastal Highway south of Belize City will likely be submerged, according to the nation's principal hydrologist. Popular tourist destinations off mainland Belize, including San Pedro, Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker, are likely to be hit by the storm. Nadine will likely weaken Saturday afternoon once the storm is inland and should dissipate over Mexico Sunday morning, the NHC said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-nadine-sweeps-across-belize-dumps-rains-on-mexico/7828736.html	2024-10-19T09:46:27-07:00	
Turkey says Israel pushing Iran to take 'legitimate steps'	ISTANBUL — Israel's attacks in Lebanon and Gaza are pushing Iran to take 'legitimate steps,' Turkey's foreign minister said Saturday in a joint news conference in Istanbul with his Iranian counterpart. 'Israel's aggressive stance is forcing Iran to take legitimate steps,' Turkey's Hakan Fidan said alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 'constantly opening new fronts in the region' and 'trying to draw Iran into this war,' he said. 'The risk of war spreading to the entire region should not be underestimated.' Araghchi, who took part in Friday's meeting of South Caucasus nations in Istanbul, said the rising tension in Lebanon was 'very worrying.' 'The possibility of war in the region is always serious, and no one other than the Zionist regime wants that to happen. We want to reduce tensions, but we are ready for any scenario,' he said. Iran backs the Islamist groups Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, whose top leaders have been killed by Israel in the widening Middle East crisis. Iran also backs Houthi rebels in Yemen and Shiite militias in Iraq, as well as Syria's armed forces. Tehran collectively calls these proxies and militias an 'axis of resistance' against Israel. On October 1, Iran launched a barrage of around 200 missiles in retaliation for the September 27 killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel, which has vowed to strike back at Iran for that barrage, killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on Wednesday. Sinwar was the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attacks that triggered the current conflict. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned they would hit Israel 'painfully' if it attacks Iranian targets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-says-israel-pushing-iran-to-take-legitimate-steps-/7828728.html	2024-10-19T09:38:26-07:00	
Iran hosts joint naval drills with Russia, Oman in Indian Ocean	Naval drills hosted by Iran with the participation of Russia and Oman and observed by nine other countries began in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, Iran's state TV said. The exercises, dubbed 'IMEX 2024,' are aimed at boosting 'collective security in the region, expand multilateral cooperation and display the goodwill and capabilities to safeguard peace, friendship and maritime security,' the English-language Press TV said. Participants would practice tactics to ensure international maritime trade security, protect maritime routes, enhance humanitarian measures and exchange information on rescue and relief operations, it said. The exercises coincide with heightened tensions in the region as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza rages and Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels retaliate by launching attacks on ships in the Red Sea. In response to regional tensions with the United States, Iran has increased its military cooperation with Russia and China. In March, Iran, China and Russia held their fifth joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman. Countries observing the current drills include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Thailand.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-hosts-joint-naval-drills-with-russia-oman-in-indian-ocean/7828715.html	2024-10-19T09:28:26-07:00	
Pro-Iran protesters storm office linked to Saudi TV channel in Iraq	BAGHDAD, IRAQ — Supporters of pro-Iran armed groups in Iraq ransacked offices affiliated with a Saudi TV channel in Baghdad early Saturday, two security sources said, after the broadcaster aired a report referring to commanders of Tehran-backed militant groups as 'terrorists.' After midnight, between 400 and 500 people attacked the studios of a production company in Baghdad that works for the Saudi broadcaster MBC. 'They wrecked the electronic equipment, the computers, and set fire to a part of the building,' an Interior Ministry source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. He said the fire had been extinguished and the crowd dispersed by police. 'Security forces are still deployed near the building,' he said. There were no immediate reports of arrests. On Saturday morning, a large police presence remained in the area, blocking access to the site, according to an AFP photographer. 'The demonstrators arrived at the offices before reinforcements of riot police were sent in,' a police source told AFP, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. The second source confirmed that the offices had been 'set on fire' and 'badly ransacked.' Insulting resistance leaders Excerpts from an MBC program had been making the rounds on Iraqi social media, sparking angry reactions from the pro-Iran camp. The report focused on 'terrorism' in the region and mentioned several groups and notable figures, including, for instance, Osama bin Laden. It included groups belonging to the so-called Axis of Resistance backed by Iran, which counts Hamas, Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthis and armed Iraqi factions among its members. Named in the report were former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel in Beirut last month, and former Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July. It also referred to Haniyeh's successor, Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and was killed in Gaza on Thursday, as the 'new face of terrorism.' The report came at a time when Iran-backed groups — most notably Hamas and Hezbollah but also their allies in Yemen, Iraq and Syria — have been at war with Israel for more than a year. The Sabreen News channel, which is close to pro-Iran factions in Iraq, distributed videos on Telegram of protesters in Baghdad brandishing the flags of various armed groups. Iraqi leadership and pro-Iran groups The Iraqi government is led by a pro-Iran majority and has made diplomatic efforts to stay out of the regional conflict. However, the so-called Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a nebulous group of pro-Iran armed groups, claims responsibility for frequent drone attacks against Israel. Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals but began a rapprochement in 2023. The war in Gaza, meanwhile, has put an end to discussions about Saudi Arabia potentially recognizing Israel. Iraqi lawmaker Mustafa Sanad, a member of the pro-Iran majority, accused MBC of 'insulting resistance leaders in all countries,' saying the report would have been more suited to Israeli TV. 'It is not enough to ransack or set fire' to the broadcaster's offices, Sanad said on X, formerly Twitter, vowing to work to 'cancel the license' of the channel in Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-iran-protesters-storm-office-linked-to-saudi-tv-channel-in-iraq/7828711.html	2024-10-19T09:16:36-07:00	
Demographic changes shake up Arizona presidential politics	People in all 50 states will vote in this year’s U.S. presidential election. But it is outcomes from seven so-called swing states that will likely determine the winner. The Southwestern state of Arizona traditionally favored Republican candidates, but Democrat Joe Biden won the state in 2020, and its electoral votes are up for grabs again in 2024.

Southeast Asia bears brunt of US trade curbs on Uyghur forced labor	BANGKOK — Southeast Asia is bearing the mounting brunt of U.S. trade curbs aimed at stemming the forced labor of ethnic minority Uyghurs in China, with billions of dollars in blocked exports, the latest U.S. trade figures show. Economists and human rights experts ascribe the heavy hit the region is taking to global supply chains shifting to reroute exports from China through Southeast Asia and to China’s persistent dominance in key commodities. With both powerful forces at play, Southeast Asia is 'caught in the middle,' Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA. The United States has detained $3.56 billion worth of imports in all since its Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or UFLPA, took effect in mid-2022, according to recent figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Some 86% of those, more than $3 billion worth, arrived from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Only $395 million arrived directly from China. The act forbids imports of any products made in whole or in part in China’s Xinjiang autonomous region, the Uyghurs’ historic homeland, presuming they have been made with forced labor. While many of the shipments are eventually allowed to enter the United States, the burden is on the importer to secure their release by proving the products are produced without forced labor, a process that can take months. The United States and other governments have accused China of genocide over its treatment of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs for subjecting them to not only forced labor but mass surveillance and detention, religious persecution and forced sterilization — all denied by Beijing. Xinjiang is a major source of some commodities crucial to the global supply chain, including 12% of the world’s aluminum, more than a third of the polysilicon for solar panels and 90% of the cotton produced by China, according to the Coalition to End Forced Labor in the Uyghur Region, a global network of rights groups. Many of those supply chains now flow through Southeast Asia for reasons beyond just the UFLPA, said Nick Marro, principal Asia economist and global trade lead analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit. 'For years, multinational companies — both Chinese and non-Chinese owned — have been pouring investment into Southeast Asia to construct supply chains aimed at dodging U.S. tariffs,' he told VOA. While far from the only reason for the influx, he said, 'shifting some production chains to Vietnam or Thailand, for example, can obfuscate whether a good might originally be produced in China.' 'This isn't necessarily a fool-proof strategy,' Marro said. 'U.S. trade authorities are very sensitive to illegal transshipments and other efforts aimed at circumventing U.S. duties. But for some supply chains, cracking down on these activities can be challenging — especially for products like cotton, which is notoriously difficult to trace.' Evolving supply chains now require looking beyond exports arriving directly from China to catch what’s made there, said Menon, a former lead economist for trade with the Asian Development Bank. 'Increasingly there’s production and value addition in multiple countries,' he said. 'Simply looking at goods that emanate from Xinjiang to the U.S. will not capture the intended objective.' Of the slightly more than $3 billion worth of exports the United States has detained from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam because of the UFLPA, the vast majority, $2.96 billion, have been electronics, including solar panels. Louisa Greve, global advocacy director for the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, ascribes that to the surge of investment from Chinese solar panel makers into Southeast Asia starting more than a decade ago. 'We don’t know of any Uyghurs working in Southeast Asia in solar, but we do know where the polysilicon has to come from. That’s the issue,' she told VOA. 'It’s about the components.' Greve added that the Southeast Asian countries and companies involved in importing and incorporating that polysilicon into the solar panels they help make and export also risk being complicit in the state-sponsored forced labor that goes into producing it in China. 'Thirty-five percent of the world’s polysilicon, or solar-grade polysilicon, is coming from China. It’s up to every manufacturer, like the plants that are actually making solar panels in Southeast Asia … to say, ‘We have to be responsible for the raw materials that we’re using,’' she said. Menon asserted the UFLPA could benefit low-wage countries less tainted by forced labor than China by driving more business their way, but he said that Southeast Asia will still struggle to wean itself off Chinese supplies. 'China is still the hub or the center of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] supply chains. That hasn’t changed. There’s been some reconfiguration taking place, but by and large, China’s not going away,' he said. Menon said that 'blunt' trade tools like the act can also hurt the countries in the middle of those supply chains by driving existing production and investment away, leaving local workers with less work or fewer jobs. 'This [act] is quite a big move, quite a massive measure, and so I’d be surprised if it doesn’t have some impact in moving production around,' he said. 'If you ban imports in this way, inevitably there will be some shifts that move production in a way that tries to circumvent those bans.' Marro said the same pressures that drove companies to 'de-risk' by moving production from China to Southeast Asia years ago could yet prove a 'double-edged sword.' While the shift has boosted Southeast Asia’s economies, the costs may mount as the United States and others start taking a harder look at countries helping China evade their trade curbs. Even with only 11 months of the 2024 fiscal year reported, U.S. customs figures show the UFLPA blocked more imports from Southeast Asia over the past year than the year before. Marro said enforcement efforts were at a 'very real risk' of picking up but added that geopolitics could also intervene. 'As much as U.S. officials want to crack down on Chinese tariff circumvention, there's an equal effort to avoid isolating Southeast Asia when it comes to the U.S.'s increasingly hawkish strategy towards China,' he said. 'This balancing act will characterize the future of U.S. policy to the region.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/southeast-asia-bears-brunt-of-us-trade-curbs-on-uyghur-forced-labor/7828673.html	2024-10-19T08:54:12-07:00	
Mozambique rocked by killings of opposition figures	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Gunmen in two vehicles chased down the lawyer for Mozambique's leading opposition politician and a senior opposition official and fatally shot them in their SUV late at night on a main avenue in the capital, their party said Saturday, in a brutal burst of violence that rocked a country where tensions were already high amid a disputed election. The killings came as the opposition party the two men were associated with prepared to challenge the results of this month's presidential election that drew more allegations of vote rigging and clamping down on dissent against the governing party, which has been in power for nearly 50 years. Elvino Dias, a lawyer and advisor to opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, was killed late Friday night by gunmen who riddled his car with bullets in the port capital of Maputo, the PODEMOS opposition party said. Paulo Guambe, a senior member and the spokesperson for PODEMOS, was also in the car and died in the shooting, the party said in a statement. The killings are 'further clear evidence of the lack of justice that we are all subjected to,' PODEMOS said. PODEMOS is a relatively new opposition party. It challenged the 49-year rule of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, party in the October 9 election. Although Mondlane ran for president as an independent, he was supported by PODEMOS. Mondlane, PODEMOS and other opposition parties have accused Frelimo of electoral fraud and rigging the election. Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo holds a clear lead in the presidential race, according to preliminary results. Mondlane was second behind Chapo. The final election results are due to be announced next week, and Chapo is expected to be announced as the winner to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served a maximum of two terms, taking the leftist Frelimo's grip on power past a half-century. Dias was seen as a key figure in the legal preparations to challenge the results of the election in the Constitutional Council, Mozambique’s supreme electoral court. Mondlane and PODEMOS had also called for a nationwide strike to protest the election results. Adriano Nuvunga, the director of Mozambican human rights nongovernmental organization the Center for Democracy and Development, wrote on social media that the killing of Dias was a 'political assassination' amid rising tensions. Authorities did not immediately comment on the killings, which are widely viewed in Mozambique as politically motivated. Frelimo, which has been in power in the southern African country since independence from Portugal in 1975, has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Rights groups accused Mozambican authorities of clamping down on dissent in the run-up to the election and have also accused security forces of using deadly force to break up peaceful protests. Police broke up a post-election march by Mondlane supporters in the central city of Nampula earlier this week. There has been a large police presence on the streets of Maputo for days. While Frelimo has regularly faced accusations of manipulating elections, harassing the opposition and the arbitrary arrests of journalists, the assassination of high-profile political leaders would be new 'and a major escalation of violence,' Marcelo Mosse, editor of the independent online newspaper Carta de Mocambique, wrote in a Saturday morning column. The shooting happened just before midnight on Joaquim Chissano Avenue near the Russian Embassy, according to a local resident, who said he heard the gunshots. The resident, who asked not to be identified, said he was close enough to smell the gunpowder in the air after the shooting. He said he heard a steady sequence of around five shots followed a few seconds later by another round of five shots. Videos published on social media — and shared widely in Mozambique — showed a dark gray BMW SUV in the middle of the road with numerous bullet holes in the bodywork. People were gathered around the car soon after the shooting, and some of the video showed what appeared to be the bodies of two men, one with blood on his chest, in the front seats. The other body was slumped over.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-rocked-by-killings-of-opposition-figures/7828644.html	2024-10-19T08:22:45-07:00	
Court halts Italy’s contested migrant centers in Albania	ROME — Human rights groups and some analysts call Italy's opening this week of migrant processing centers in Albania controversial and illegal. The Italian government is now appealing a court ruling against its flagship project to move migrant facilities offshore. Italy’s right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, hailed her country’s deal — signed in November 2023 but enacted this week — with neighboring Albania to process migrant asylum claims there as 'courageous,' in remarks this week to Parliament. Under the five-year deal, up to 3,000 migrants rescued by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be transferred to Albania. An initial screening occurs on the ships before the migrants are sent to Albania for further screening. 'Italy has set a good example by signing the Italy-Albania protocol to process a final phase on Albanian territory but under Italian and European jurisdiction,' Meloni said. Meloni’s government argues that diverting asylum seekers to migrant centers it set up under the agreement in Albania will help fight human trafficking and permit those with a genuine right entry to the European Union. A special immigration court in Rome ruled on Friday that it was unlawful for the government to send this first batch of 12 Egyptian and Bangladeshi migrants to Albania for processing. The court said they had to be returned to Italy because their countries of origin could not be considered safe if they were repatriated. Kelly Petillo of the European Council on Foreign Relations told VOA there was political dissension over the controversial issue. 'There is a different push-and-pull factor in domestic legislation, and I expect the same in other countries that will look to implement these agreements,' Petillo said. 'After all the political and financial investment that went into implementing this scheme, the result is that the migrants have been returned. So, I have major doubts that the implementation will be successful in any way. 'All these countries are watching and, so far, they cannot see good results.' Petillo also referred to Britain backing away from its controversial and expensive plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as ultimately unworkable. Italy’s center-left opposition quickly called for an end to the Albania plan, saying the court ruling proves its illegality. Meloni’s government is undaunted, though, and plans to appeal. She called the court decision 'prejudiced,' suggesting she would draft new rules to rectify the issue. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier said the EU could 'draw lessons' from Italy’s new migrant processing centers in Albania. Meeting in Brussels Thursday, many EU leaders agreed to enact urgent and stricter laws to curb irregular migration and speed up migrant returns. They fear the extreme right in Europe is using the contentious migrant issue to gain political ground in elections and see outsourcing the problem as one solution. However, activists and analysts question the traditional EU values and the legality of such mechanisms. Elisa DePieri of Amnesty International told VOA that the Italy-Albania plan forces refugees and migrants to face longer sea journeys to Albania, where they face potentially prolonged detention and may experience an end to their right to seek asylum. 'We are very concerned that the whole system rests on automatic detention from the very beginning,' she said. 'Automatic detention is arbitrary and unlawful under international law. The default position is for the respect of the right of liberty for the individual and any exception should be validated by a judge on the basis of an individual assessment.' Davide Colombi, a researcher at the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies, speaking to Euronews, pointed to additional legal hurdles. 'This is extremely problematic,' he said. 'The right to asylum is a fundamental right that cannot be suspended even in times of legally declared crisis. It is protected under EU law, under international law, which shows that this not a migration issue alone, but it is a broader rule-of-law issue.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-halts-italy-s-contested-migrant-centers-in-albania/7828624.html	2024-10-19T07:59:32-07:00	
Israel unearths Hezbollah's web of tunnels in southern Lebanon	TEL AVIV, ISRAEL — Israeli forces have spent much of the past year destroying Hamas’ vast underground network in Gaza. They are now focused on dismantling tunnels and other hideouts belonging to Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon. Scarred by Hamas’ deadly raid into Israel last year that sparked the war in Gaza, Israel says it aims to prevent a similar incursion across its northern border from ever getting off the ground. The Israeli military has combed through the dense brush of southern Lebanon for the past two weeks, uncovering what it says are Hezbollah’s deep attack capabilities — highlighted by a tunnel system equipped with weapons caches and rocket launchers that Israel says pose a direct threat to nearby communities. Israel’s war against the Iran-backed militant group stretches far inside Lebanon, and its airstrikes in recent weeks have killed more than 1,700 people, about a quarter of whom were women and children, according to local health authorities. But its ground campaign has centered on a narrow patch of land just along the border, where Hezbollah has had a longstanding presence. Hezbollah’s deep ties to southern Lebanon Hezbollah, which has called for Israel’s destruction, is the Arab world’s most significant paramilitary force. It began firing rockets into Israel a day after Hamas' attack. After nearly a year of tit-for-tat fighting with Hezbollah, Israel launched its ground invasion into southern Lebanon on October 1 and has since sent thousands of troops into the rugged terrain. Even as it continues to bolster its forces, Israel says its invasion consists of 'limited, localized and targeted ground raids' that are meant to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure so that tens of thousands of displaced Israelis can return home. The fighting also has uprooted more than 1 million Lebanese in the past month. Many residents of southern Lebanon are supporters of the group and benefit from its social outreach. Although most fled the area months ago, they widely see the heavily armed Hezbollah as their defender, especially as the U.S.-backed Lebanese army does not have suitable weapons to protect them from any Israeli incursion. That broad support has allowed Hezbollah to establish 'a military infrastructure for itself' within the villages, said Eva J. Koulouriotis, a political analyst specialized in the Middle East and Islamic militant groups. The Israeli military says it has found weapons within homes and buildings in the villages. Tunnels in multiple areas of Lebanon With Israel’s air power far outstripping Hezbollah’s defenses, the militant group has turned to underground tunnels to elude Israeli drones and jets. Experts say Hezbollah's tunnels are not limited to the south. 'It’s a land of tunnels,' said Tal Beeri, who studies Hezbollah as director of research at the Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank with a focus on northern Israel’s security. Koulouriotis said tunnels stretch under the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah's command and control are located and where it keeps a stockpile of strategic missiles. She said the group also maintains tunnels along the border with Syria, which it uses to smuggle weapons and other supplies from Iran into Lebanon. Southern Lebanon is where Hezbollah maintains tunnels to store missiles — and from where it can launch them, Koulouriotis said. Some of the more than 50 Israelis killed by Hezbollah over the past year were hit by anti-tank missiles. In contrast to the tunnels dug out by Hamas in the sandy coastal terrain of Gaza, Hezbollah's tunnels in southern Lebanon were carved into solid rock, a feat that likely required time, money, machinery and expertise. An Israeli military official said that using prior intelligence, Israel had found 'hundreds and hundreds and hundreds' of underground positions, many of which could hold about 10 fighters and were stocked with rations. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military rules, said troops were blowing up the tunnels found or using cement to make them unusable. The group used tunnels during the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but the network has been expanded since, even as a United Nations cease-fire resolution compelled Lebanese and U.N. forces to keep Hezbollah fighters out of the south. In mid-August, Hezbollah released a video showing what appeared to be a cavernous underground tunnel large enough for trucks loaded with missiles to drive through. Hezbollah operatives were also seen riding motorcycles inside the illuminated tunnel, named Imad-4 after the group’s late military commander, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in Syria in 2008 in an explosion blamed on Israel. Hinderance to Israel's mission Israeli troops are pushing through southern Lebanon using tanks and engineering equipment, and air and ground forces have struck thousands of targets in the area since the invasion began. The military recently said it found one cross-border tunnel that stretched just a few meters into Israel but did not have an opening. Israel also exposed a tunnel shaft that was located about 100 meters from a United Nations peacekeepers’ post, although it wasn't clear what the precise purpose of that tunnel was. Israel says the tunnels are stocked with supplies and weapons and are outfitted with lighting, ventilation and sometimes plumbing, indicating they could be used for long stays. It says it has arrested several Hezbollah fighters hiding inside, including three on Tuesday who were said to have been found armed. The Israeli military official said many Hezbollah fighters appear to have withdrawn from the area. Lebanese military expert, Naji Malaeb, a retired brigadier general, said he assessed that Hezbollah’s tunnels were preventing Israel from making major gains. He compared that achievement to the war in Gaza, where Hamas has used its tunnels to bedevil Israeli forces and stage insurgency-like attacks. Israeli authorities insist the mission in Lebanon is succeeding. It says it has killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters since the ground operation in Lebanon began, although at least 15 Israeli soldiers have been killed during that time. Israel has encountered Hezbollah’s tunnels before. In 2018, Israel launched an operation to destroy what is said were attack tunnels that crossed into Israeli territory. Beeri said that six tunnels were discovered, including one that was 1 kilometer long and 80 meters deep, crossing some 50 meters into Israel. October 7-style terror attack For Israel, the tunnels are evidence that Hezbollah planned what Israel says would be a bloody offensive against communities in the north. 'Hezbollah has openly declared that it plans to carry out its own October 7 massacre on Israel’s northern border, on an even larger scale,' Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the day troops entered Lebanon. Israel has not released evidence that any such attack was imminent but has expressed concern that one might be launched once residents return. Former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month while in an underground bunker, had signaled in speeches that Hezbollah could launch an attack on northern Israel. In May 2023, just months before Hamas’ attack, Hezbollah staged a simulation of an incursion into northern Israel with rifle-toting militants on motorcycles bursting through a mock border fence bedecked with Israeli flags. Hezbollah officials have at times framed calls for an attack against Israel as a defensive measure that would be taken in times of war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-unearths-hezbollah-s-web-of-tunnels-in-southern-lebanon/7828607.html	2024-10-19T07:37:04-07:00	
South Sudan works to reintegrate young mothers back into school	JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — South Sudan is making significant strides in addressing the gender gap in education by reintegrating teenage mothers into schools, experts say. Juol Nhomngek Daniel, a South Sudanese lawmaker, said the rate of early and forced marriage among teenage girls is alarming. 'This is a very serious issue that ... South Sudan should pay attention to because it mostly disadvantages women and young girls,' Daniel said. Early marriage is still common in many communities in South Sudan. Girls are often married off to secure economic stability for their families, a practice that not only limits their potential by denying their right to education but also perpetuates cycles of poverty. For example, Fatima was in her final year of primary school when she was forced into marriage. Her family cited financial struggles as the reason for the early marriage, a move that nearly ended her education. 'I was forced to get married by my parents. That’s why I had to drop out of school,' said Fatima, whose real name is not being used for fear of reprisals. Fatima’s story mirrors that of Naye, who had her first child during her final year of high school. Her parents saw her pregnancy as the end of her education. Naye (also not her real name) said that after she conceived, she 'never got the support' that she used to receive from her parents, and that she struggles 'to provide for myself and for my girl.' Determined to continue her education, Naye returned to school six months after giving birth, defying societal expectations. Now she is pursuing a degree in business administration at St. John Catholic University in Yambio. For Nelly (not her real name), her parents saw her marriage as an opportunity for economic gain. A local man promised to give her parents several cows and millions of South Sudanese pounds as a dowry, leading them to push her into marriage. Nelly had her own dreams, though, and agreed to marry a man of her choosing, with the condition that he would allow her to go back to school. 'I got a man because my parents weren’t paying my school fees,' she said. 'He told me to first give birth, and then he would pay my school fees. That’s how I got pregnant and dropped out of school. Now he has accepted to pay for my education.' Daniel, the lawmaker, said addressing early and forced marriage in South Sudan requires a concerted effort to challenge deep-seated cultural practices. 'It is hard to eliminate because of cultural aspects,' Daniel said. 'Early and forced marriage is seen as a positive value in the society rather than a vice. To eradicate it, we need deep-rooted government policies that address practices like forced and child marriage.' Attitudes are slowly changing in communities where education for girls is not a priority, thanks to grassroots campaigns by international organizations. These efforts are reshaping cultural perceptions and highlighting the value of educating girls. Now back in school, Fatima encourages parents to reconsider early marriage and prioritize education for their children, especially girls. 'I would never want my daughter to go through the life I’ve experienced,' she said. 'I will give my children equal rights to education and ensure they have the support I didn’t.' The Ministry of General Education and Instruction reports that over 70% of children — more than 2.8 million — are not going to school. Conflict, displacement and early marriage are the major reasons for the high dropout rates. International organizations such as Save the Children play a crucial role in supporting girls' education, especially for young mothers such as Fatima and Naye. Isaac Otieno, education technical specialist at Save the Children International in Juba, said his organization 'has been deliberate in supporting girls in school.' 'We are investing heavily in reenrolling young mothers who dropped out due to pregnancy,' he said. 'Through our Multi-Year Resilience Program, funded by Education Cannot Wait, we provide school uniforms, scholastic materials, and advocate with school authorities to accept these young mothers back into school.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-works-to-reintegrate-young-mothers-back-into-school/7828593.html	2024-10-19T07:04:50-07:00	
Nigeria rolls out long-anticipated malaria vaccine	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigeria officially launched its malaria vaccination campaign this week to protect millions of children from the deadly disease, focusing heavily on high-risk states. The first 846,000 doses of the R21 malaria vaccine arrived in Abuja, Nigeria, on Thursday, marking a milestone in efforts to eliminate malaria. According to the World Health Organization, the country accounts for about 27% of global malaria cases. In 2022, it recorded nearly 67 million infections and nearly 200,000 deaths, about 80% of the deaths occurring in children under age 5. Dr. Muyi Aina, head of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, said the initial rollout prioritizes high-risk regions. 'We expect another 140,000 or so to make a million doses in this first batch,' Aina said. 'Every child, every person that is vaccinated, needs to get two doses. So, we know that that's a limited number of people. So, we have prioritized the highest-burden locations in the country, Kebbi and Bayelsa.' The government is covering part of the vaccine costs, with global vaccine group Gavi and international partners funding the rest. Health Minister Muhammad Pate stressed that the vaccine will be administered to recipients at no charge. 'These vaccines are free for [the] population, but they cost resources,' he said. Not everyone would be able to afford the vaccines, Pate said. 'The children of the poor in rural areas are the ones that may not be able to access them,' he said. 'That's why we've prioritized public financing in that regard, and we thank our partners for contributing toward it.' Nigeria has improved vaccine logistics for hard-to-reach regions. UNICEF's chief of health in Nigeria, Dr. Eduardo Celades, expressed confidence in the country’s distribution capacity. 'Transportation and storage [are] a key issue,' he said. 'How [can you] ensure that the cold chain has the integrity needed to keep safe the vaccines and to keep them effective? But we are confident that we know that we have the capacities.' Malaria remains a complex challenge, requiring a mix of strategies such as mosquito control, better health care access and vaccine monitoring. Malaria elimination strategic adviser Olugbenga Mokuolu said the vaccine complements traditional tools such as bed nets and treatments, offering children added protection. 'We know that no single tool offers 100% of the solution,' Mokuolu said. 'That's why we still talk about the combination of tools. But having the vaccine layering on it is very significant. ... With the deployment of this vaccine, we will be conducting ... an effectiveness study in order to note the rate of reoccurrence while on the vaccine.' The WHO approved the RTS,S and R21 vaccines, with R21 showing 77% efficacy in trials. Other African countries, including Uganda and Burkina Faso, have begun vaccine distribution, reflecting the continent's push to combat malaria. Experts say the success of the malaria rollout depends on sustained engagement with local leaders and caregivers to ensure children complete their doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-rolls-out-long-anticipated-malaria-vaccine/7828564.html	2024-10-19T06:19:22-07:00	
North Korean troops in Ukraine would be escalation, France warns	KYIV, UKRAINE — The involvement of North Korean regular troops to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine would be a serious escalation of the war, France and Ukraine's foreign ministers said at a joint press conference in Kyiv on Saturday. France's Jean-Noel Barrot, who was making his first trip to Ukraine since becoming foreign minister in September, is also set to visit the east of the country, where France will finance new two new centers for the protection of children affected by the war, on Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused North Korea on Thursday of deploying officers alongside Russia and of preparing to send 10,000 soldiers to help Moscow's war effort, although NATO chief Mark Rutte said there was no evidence of Pyongyang's presence at this stage. 'It would be serious and push the conflict into a new stage, an additional escalatory stage,' Barrot said in Kyiv, adding that such a move would signal that Moscow was struggling in the war. His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, said the risk of escalation from the move was 'huge.' 'This is a huge threat of further escalation of Russian aggression against Ukraine. There is a big risk of it growing out of its current scale and borders,' he said. Earlier this week, Zelenskyy presented his victory plan, which he said would enable Ukraine to end the war no later than next year. The first step of this plan was unconditional NATO membership for Ukraine. France's foreign minister said that Paris was open to the idea of an immediate invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, but that talks would continue on the subject with allies. 'Regarding the invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, we are open to it and it's a discussion that we are having with our partners,' Barrot said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-troops-in-ukraine-would-be-escalation-france-warns/7828529.html	2024-10-19T04:59:41-07:00	
G7 defense summit convenes as conflicts rage	NAPLES, ITALY — G7 defense ministers started talks on Saturday against a backdrop of escalation in the Middle East and mounting pressure on Ukraine as it faces another winter of fighting. Italy, holding the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven countries, organized the body's first ministerial meeting dedicated to defense, staged in Naples, the southern city that is also home to a NATO base. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto welcomed each of the attendees, including NATO chief Mark Rutte and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. 'I believe that our presence today ... sends a strong message to those who try to hinder our democratic systems,' Crosetto said as he opened the event. 'The brutal Russian aggressions in Ukraine and the indeed critical situation in the Middle East, combined with the profound instability of sub-Saharan Africa and the increasing tension in the Indo-Pacific region highlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive,' he said. 'Ample space' would be given to discussing the escalating Middle East conflict during the one-day summit, Crosetto said a day earlier in Brussels. Also on the summit agenda is the war in Ukraine, development and security in Africa and the situation in the Asia-Pacific. Middle East The meeting comes two days after Israel announced it killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the devastating retaliatory war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sinwar's death in the Palestinian territory signaled 'the beginning of the end' of the war against Hamas, while U.S. President Joe Biden said it opened the door to 'a path to peace.' Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, was in Lebanon on Friday, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah. Speaking in Beirut, Meloni slammed attacks on U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon as 'unacceptable' after the U.N. force accused Israel of targeting their positions. Italy has around 1,000 troops in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries. Ukraine On Ukraine, the ministers will contemplate Kyiv entering a third winter at war, battlefield losses in the east — and the prospect of reduced U.S. military support should Donald Trump be elected to the White House next month. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, under mounting pressure from Western allies to forge a winning strategy against Russia, on Thursday presented what he called a victory plan to the European Union and NATO. Its main thrust is a call for immediate NATO membership, deemed unfeasible by alliance members. It also demands the ability to strike military targets inside Russia with long-range weapons, and an undefined 'nonnuclear strategic deterrence package' on Ukrainian territory. Under discussion will also likely be reports, based on South Korean intelligence, that North Korea is deploying large numbers of troops to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. NATO was not as yet able to confirm that intelligence, Rutte said on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/g7-defense-summit-convenes-as-conflicts-rage/7828501.html	2024-10-19T03:20:11-07:00	
Aging farmers face extreme temperatures as they struggle to maintain Japan's rice crop	KAMIMOMI, Japan — In the remote village of Kamimomi in Japan's western Okayama prefecture, a small group of rice farmers began their most recent harvest in sweltering heat, two weeks sooner than usual. The prefecture is called 'the Land of Sunshine' because of its pleasant climate, but farmers working among the paddy fields and ancient rice terraces say that climate change is hurting the harvest of rice, long a cornerstone of Japan's diet. 'Last year, an exceptional heat wave took the water out of the rice, which became small and thin,' rice farmer Joji Terasaka said. 'So I am worried about that this year because it will be just as hot.' This year Japan experienced its hottest July on record, with temperatures reaching 2.16 Celsius higher than average, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The globe has seen a 1.2 C rise in average temperature since preindustrial times, and scientists agree that warming needs to be capped at 1.5 C to stave off the worst effects of climate change. That includes even more powerful heat, storms and irreversible ice melt. Last year, Japan recorded a poor rice harvest nationwide because of exceptionally hot weather. Ministry data showed the country's private-sector rice inventory fell to 1.56 million tons in June, the lowest level since records began in 1999. Last year was the hottest on record globally, though it's feared that this year may top it. The drop in harvest in Japan was partly to blame for this year's widespread summer rice shortage, according to officials. There were empty shelves in supermarkets, and some retailers are still enforcing purchase limits of one rice bag per customer. 'Perhaps people think that an increase of one degree Celsius in average temperature isn't much. But it's quite a big change for plants and crops,' says Yuji Masutomi, a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. Masutomi said the rising temperatures not only influence the growth cycle and yield of rice, but also hurt the quality of the grain. When temperatures rise above 27 C, the buildup of starch inside rice grains is reduced. That causes the crop to take on a chalky appearance, and its value is reduced. At least a fifth of rice farms have reported a drop in quality from rising temperatures, according to a farming ministry report last year. 'Not only is the appearance not good; people say the taste drops too,' Masutomi said. For farmers in Kamimomi, there's another problem with working under exceptional heat. The average age of agricultural workers in Japan is nearly 69, among the oldest in the world, and older people are especially vulnerable to heatstroke. Toshimi Kaiami led a community project in Kamimomi that involved reviving some of the paddy fields abandoned because of the aging population. 'There are no longer any successors,' says Kaiami. 'We are heading toward extinction.' The community project divides labor among Kamimomi's farmers. But preparations for the harvest coincided with the hottest months of the year — April to September. 'It takes a half year to produce rice. The heat and the work that we have to endure during that time is really tough,' said rice farmer Mitsumasa Sugimoto, 77. To deal with climate change, the government is promoting the adoption of heat-resistant rice variants, including Sai no Kizuna, which was developed by a research center in Saitama prefecture, near Tokyo. Research organizations around the world have worked to produce more resilient strains of essential food like rice while introducing more heat and drought resistant grains like sorghum or millet. 'Last year and this year have been extremely hot, but even in those conditions, Sai no Kizuna maintained a certain level of quality,' said Naoto Ohoka, who manages rice breeding at Saitama's Agricultural Technology Research Center. 'Its other characteristic is that it is very delicious.' The center cultivates more than a thousand types of rice strains, and through cross-pollination officials assess and select the best performers to develop new varieties. Sai no Kizuna was developed in 2012 to better withstand heat, a trait that has become more widely recognized recently as Japan sees hotter summers. The strain also stands up well against typhoon wind and certain pests and diseases. Researchers want to develop more resilient strains against heat as temperatures are projected to continue rising. Masutomi recommends that variants tolerant of temperatures up to 3 degrees Celsius higher should be introduced across Japan by the 2040s. But it's a long process. It can take up to 10 years to develop a new variant. Once it's approved for the market, farmers must then be convinced to switch to the new strain. The most widely grown variety is Koshihikari, which is less heat resistant. Even so, older farmers have shown a reluctance to switch to other varieties. Farming ministry data show that only around 15% of Japanese paddy fields have adopted heat resistance variants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aging-farmers-face-extreme-temperatures-as-they-struggle-to-maintain-japan-s-rice-crop/7827056.html	2024-10-19T01:13:39-07:00	
Strike launched toward Israeli prime minister's house	JERUSALEM — Israel’s government said a drone was launched toward the prime minister’s house Saturday, with no casualties. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. The strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanon’s Hezbollah — a Hamas ally backed by Iran — has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant group’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which it’s fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas’ leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwar’s death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. 'Hamas is alive and will stay alive,' Khamenei said. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated terrorist organizations by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strike-launched-toward-israeli-prime-minister-s-house/7828478.html	2024-10-19T01:11:27-07:00	
Florida digs out of mountains of sand swept in by back-to-back hurricanes	BRADENTON BEACH, Florida — When a hurricane sets its sights on Florida, storm-weary residents may think of catastrophic wind, hammering rain and dangerous storm surge. Mounds of sand swallowing their homes? Not so much. That's the reality for some after Hurricanes Helene and Milton clobbered Florida's Gulf Coast with back-to-back hits in less than two weeks. Storm surge as high as 3 meters swept mountains of sand into communities — in some areas, 1.5 meters high or higher. The fine, white sand helps make Florida's beaches among the best in the world. But the powerful storms have turned the precious commodity into a costly nuisance, with sand creating literal barriers to recovery as homeowners and municipalities dig their way out. 'I've never seen sand like this,' said Scott Bennett, a contractor who has worked in storm recovery since 2005's Hurricane Katrina. 'Wind, rain, water, but never sand.' The morning after Hurricane Milton crashed ashore, the roads of Bradenton Beach, about an hour's drive south of Tampa, were lined with sandbanks less than a meter high, surrounding some bungalows. The views of the Old Florida beach town were not unlike those after a blustery Midwestern blizzard. 'The best way to describe it, it's like getting 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) of snow up north,' said Jeremi Roberts, a member of the State Emergency Response Team surveying the damage that day. Another hour south, Ron and Jean Dyer said the storms blew about 0.9 meters of sand up against their condo building on Venice Island. 'The beach just moved over everything,' Ron Dyer said. It had taken dozens of volunteers armed with shovels and wheelbarrows two days to dig all the sand out of the condo's pool after Hurricane Helene, only to see Milton fill it back in, he said. 'They just kept digging and wheeling and digging and wheeling. … They were there for two days doing that,' he said. 'We got to do it all over again.' Storm recovery contractor Larry West estimates that his team will do about $300,000 worth of work just to clean up all the sand and debris left behind at one of the condo buildings he's restoring in Manasota Key, about 56 kilometers south of Sarasota. He expects many property owners, especially those who don't have flood insurance, will have to pay out of pocket for this kind of cleanup. 'The poor homeowner who's going to have to spend $150,000 cleaning up, that's going to hurt them hard,' West said. West said he is not sure where to take the sand, after he heard that a local park that Charlotte County officials designated as a drop-off site was filling up with the stuff. According to the county, two sites remain open for dropping off sand. 'Right now I'm building mountains in their parking area,' West said of the condo complex he's restoring. 'We're just kind of waiting to find out if they're gonna have us transport it to a different location.' Officials in hard-hit Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg, are still crunching the numbers on just how big of a bite Helene and Milton took out of the coastline there, but county Public Works director Kelli Hammer Levy puts the current estimate at 765,000 cubic meters of sand lost. 'A lot of volume has been lost, and that's our main concern here right now,' she told the county's Tourism Development Council. 'It's hard to kind of stay positive with some of this stuff. I know the pictures are not what we want to see.' For perspective, a 2018 beach renourishment project to shore up the county's coastline with 994,000 cubic meters of sand cost more than $50 million, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Levy is hopeful that much of the displaced sand can be repurposed. Pinellas officials are encouraging residents to cart their sand right back out onto the beach — as long as it's clean. 'Again, we just need to remove debris. I've seen some piles out there with kitchen cabinets in it,' Levy said. 'We're going to have a problem if we have a lot of that stuff out there.' The county has also opened a drop-off location where residents can leave sand for workers to screen and clean, or dispose of if it's contaminated, under guidance from the state's Department of Environmental Protection. In the meantime, Florida residents are continuing to dig out of the storm-driven sand, many of them by hand. 'Every shovelful is heavy,' said West, the construction contractor. 'This is horrendous, as far as the cleanup.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-digs-out-of-mountains-of-sand-swept-in-by-back-to-back-hurricanes/7828411.html	2024-10-19T00:00:16-07:00	
Rare copy of US Constitution sells for $9M at auction	Asheville, north carolina — A rare copy of the U.S. Constitution printed 237 years ago and sent to the states to be ratified has been sold for $9 million at an auction in North Carolina. Brunk Auctions sold the document, the only copy of its type thought to be privately owned, at the private auction Thursday. The name of the buyer was not immediately released. Bidding took just over seven minutes, with bids coming in at $500,000 intervals, mostly over the phone. There was a pause at $8.5 million, then another after someone on the phone bid $9 million. 'Just another second or two. Savor it a little bit, selling here at $9 million,' said auctioneer and auction house owner Andrew Brunk. Brunk was thankful. The auction was originally set for September 28 but was delayed after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage throughout Asheville and western North Carolina. 'It's a privilege to have it here. It's been quite a ride,' Brunk said. The copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the proposed framework of the nation's government in 1787 and sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government under the Articles of Confederation, requesting it be sent to the states to be ratified by the people. It's one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the other seven are publicly owned. Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states, essentially certifying them. What happened to the document up for auction Thursday between Thomson's signature and 2022 is not known. Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and oversaw the state convention during his last year in office that ratified the Constitution. The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old chairs and a dusty book case, before the old Johnston house was preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time like a book. Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet, printed front and back, is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He acknowledged there would have to be compromise and that certain rights the states enjoyed would have to be given up for the nation's long-term health. The Constitution copy wasn't the only seven-figure purchase Thursday. A watermarked 1776 first draft of the Articles of Confederation went for $1 million. Also sold was a 1788 Journal of the Convention of North Carolina at Hillsborough, where representatives spent two weeks debating whether ratifying the Constitution would put too much power with the federal government instead of the states. The document sold for $85,000. Auction officials were not sure what the Constitution document would go for because there is so little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution that was sent to the states sold, it was for $400 in 1891. In 2021, Sotheby's of New York sold one of only 14 remaining copies of the Constitution printed for the Continental Congress and delegates to the Constitutional Convention for $43.2 million, a record for a book or document.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-copy-of-us-constitution-sells-for-9m-at-auction-/7828409.html	2024-10-18T23:59:40-07:00	
Nepal's Sherpas deserve more, says teen who scaled world's 14 tallest peaks	KATHMANDU, Nepal — A Nepali teenager, the youngest person ever to scale all 14 of the world’s tallest peaks, says he wants to use his skills to benefit the Himalayan nation’s Sherpa community and turn out world-class athletes. Sherpas, an ethnic group living mainly in the vicinity of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, are known for climbing skills that make them the backbone of mountain expeditions. They fix ropes, ladders, carry loads, cook and guide foreign climbers, earning from a single expedition amounts that range from $2,500 to $16,500 or more, depending on experience. 'I want to see Sherpas as global athletes, not just guides,' said Nima Rinji Sherpa, 18, who last week climbed Shishapangma, the world’s 14th-highest peak at 8,027 meters, in Tibet. 'We deserve the same privilege as Western climbers,' added the 12th grader, who began climbing at the age of 16, and scaled all 14 peaks exceeding 2,438 meters in the last two years. He said he planned to exploit his climbing skills to build contacts with donor agencies, mobilizing funds and support for schools, hospitals and activities to benefit the mountain community. 'I want to be a medium between the community and donor agencies,' Nima said on Wednesday, the lower portion of his face still black from burns caused by the sun's reflections off the snow during his climb. The son of a veteran Everest climber who now runs his own company organizing expeditions, Nima bested the record of Mingma Gyalu Sherpa of Nepal, who was 30 when he achieved the feat in 2019. His most demanding effort was the 8,034-meter climb of Pakistan's Gasherbrum II last year directly after having scaled Gasherbrum I, the world's 11th highest peak at 8,080 meters, in 25 hours without proper rest and food, he said. Nima said muscle cramps were his biggest physical challenge as his 'fragile' teenage body had not finished growing, adding, 'I am not as strong as I should be.' He was caught in a small avalanche on Nepal's Annapurna I peak this year after a fall of about 5-10 meters on Pakistan's Nanga Parbat last year, but luckily escaped serious injury both times. 'I never push myself beyond my bounds,' he said. 'There is (the need for) good judgment. There is (the need for) safety.' This winter, Nima aims for an alpine-style climb of Nepal's Mount Manaslu, the world’s eighth highest peak at 8,163 meters. An 8,000-meter mountain has never been climbed in winter in alpine style, he said, referring to the technique in which climbers tackle the summit in one go, without oxygen and relying chiefly on themselves, with minimum support.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nepal-s-sherpas-deserve-more-says-teen-who-scaled-world-s-14-tallest-peaks/7827098.html	2024-10-18T23:58:52-07:00	
Dense breasts can make it harder to spot cancer on a mammogram	When a woman has a mammogram, the most important finding is whether there's any sign of breast cancer. The second most important finding is whether her breasts are dense. Since early September, a new U.S. rule requires mammography centers to inform women about their breast density — information that isn't entirely new for some women because many states already had similar requirements. Here's what to know about why breast density is important. Are dense breasts bad? No, dense breasts are not bad. In fact, they're quite normal. About 40% of women ages 40 and older have dense breasts. Women of all sizes can have dense breasts. It has nothing to do with breast firmness. And it only matters in the world of breast cancer screening, said Dr. Ethan Cohen of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. With the new rule, 'there are going to be a lot of questions to a lot of doctors and there's going to be a lot of Googling, which is OK. But we want to make sure that people don't panic,' Cohen said. How is breast density determined? Doctors who review mammograms have a system for classifying breast density. There are four categories. The least dense category means the breasts are almost all fatty tissue. The most dense category means the breasts are mostly glandular and fibrous tissue. Breasts are considered dense in two of the four categories: 'heterogeneously dense' or 'extremely dense.' The other two categories are considered not dense. Dr. Brian Dontchos of the Seattle-based Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said the classification can vary depending on the doctor reading the mammogram 'because it's somewhat subjective.' Why am I being told I have dense breasts? Two reasons: For one, dense breasts make it more difficult to see cancer on an X-ray image, which is what a mammogram is. 'The dense tissue looks white on a mammogram and cancer also looks white on a mammogram,' said Dr. Wendie Berg of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific adviser to DenseBreast-info.org. 'It's like trying to see a snowball in a blizzard.' Second, women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer because cancers are more likely to arise in glandular and fibrous tissue. Reassuringly, women with dense breasts are no more likely to die from breast cancer compared to other women. What am I supposed to do? If you find out you have dense breasts, talk to your doctor about your family history of breast cancer and whether you should have additional screening with ultrasound or MRI, said Dr. Georgia Spear of Endeavor Health/NorthShore University Health System in the Chicago area. Researchers are studying better ways to detect cancer in women with dense breasts. So far, there's not enough evidence for a broad recommendation for additional screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force called for more research in this area when it updated its breast cancer screening recommendations earlier this year. Do I still need a mammogram? Yes, women with dense breasts should get regular mammograms, which is still the gold standard for finding cancer early. Age 40 is when mammograms should start for women, transgender men and nonbinary people at average risk. 'We don't want to replace the mammogram,' Spear said. 'We want to add to it by adding a specific other test.' Will insurance cover additional screening? For now, that depends on your insurance, although a bill has been introduced in Congress to require insurers to cover additional screening for women with dense breasts. Additional screening can be expensive — from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket, so that's a barrier for many women. 'Every woman should have equal opportunity to have their cancer found early when it's easily treated,' Berg said. 'That's the bottom line.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dense-breasts-can-make-it-harder-to-spot-cancer-on-a-mammogram/7825426.html	2024-10-18T23:57:15-07:00	
King's visit rekindles Australia's debate on ending ties to the British monarchy	MELBOURNE, Australia — King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived in Sydney on Friday for the first Australian visit by a reigning monarch in more than a decade, a trip that has rekindled debate about the nation's constitutional links to Britain. The Sydney Opera House's iconic sails were illuminated with images of previous royal visits to welcome the couple, whose six-day trip will be brief by royal standards. Charles, 75, is being treated for cancer, which led to the scaled-down itinerary. Charles and Camilla were welcomed in light rain at Sydney Airport by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, New South Wales state Premier Chris Minns and the king's representative in Australia, Governor-General Sam Mostyln. Charles is only the second reigning British monarch to visit Australia. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, became the first 70 years ago. While the welcome has been warm, Australia's national and state leaders want the royals removed from their constitution. Monarchists expect the visit will strengthen Australians' connection to their sovereign. Opponents hope for a rejection of the concept that someone from the other side of the world is Australia's head of state. The Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as head of state, likens the royal visit to a touring act in the entertainment industry. The ARM this week launched what it calls a campaign to 'Wave Goodbye to Royal Reign with Monarchy: The Farewell Oz Tour!' ARM co-chair Esther Anatolitis said royal visits to Australia were 'something of a show that comes to town.' 'Unfortunately, it is a reminder that Australia's head of state isn't full-time, isn't Australian. It's a part-time person based overseas who's the head of state of numerous places,' Anatolitis told the AP. 'We say to Charles and Camilla: 'Welcome, we hope you're enjoying our country and good health and good spirits.' But we also look forward to this being the final tour of a sitting Australian monarch and that when they come back to visit soon, we look forward to welcoming them as visiting dignitaries,' she added. Philip Benwell, national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, which campaigns for Australia's constitutional links to Britain to be maintained, expects reaction to the royal couple will be overwhelmingly positive. 'Something like the royal visit brings the king closer in the minds of people, because we have an absent monarchy,' Benwell told the AP. 'The visit by the king brings it home that Australia is a constitutional monarchy and it has a king,' he added. Benwell is critical of the premiers of all six states, who have declined invitations to attend a reception for Charles in the national capital, Canberra. The premiers each explained that they had more pressing engagements on the day such as cabinet meetings and overseas travel. 'It would be virtually incumbent upon the premiers to be in Canberra to meet him and pay their respects,' Benwell said. 'To not attend can be considered to be a snub, because this is not a normal visit. This is the first visit of a king ever to Australia.' Charles was drawn into Australia's republic debate months before his visit. The Australian Republic Movement wrote to Charles in December last year requesting a meeting in Australia and for the king to advocate their cause. Buckingham Palace politely wrote back in March to say the king's meetings would be decided upon by the Australian government. A meeting with the ARM does not appear on the official itinerary. 'Whether Australia becomes a republic is ... a matter for the Australian public to decide,' said the letter from Buckingham Palace. The Associated Press has seen copies of both letters. Australians decided in a referendum in 1999 to retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. That result is widely regarded as a consequence of disagreement about how a president should be chosen rather than majority support for a monarch. After visiting Sydney and Canberra, which are 250 kilometers, Charles will then travel to Samoa to open the annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. When his mother made the last of her 16 journeys to Australia in 2011 at the age of 85, she visited Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne on the east coast before opening the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the west coast city of Perth. Elizabeth's first grueling Australian tour at the age of 27 took in scores of far-flung Outback towns; an estimated 75% of the nation's population turned out to see her. Australia then had a racially discriminatory policy that favored British immigrants. Immigration policy has been non-discriminatory since 1973. Anatolitis noted that Australia is far more multicultural now, with most of the population either born overseas or with a overseas-born parent. 'In the '50s, we didn't have that global interconnectedness that we have now,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-s-visit-rekindles-australia-s-debate-on-ending-ties-to-the-british-monarchy/7828437.html	2024-10-18T23:24:16-07:00	
Guatemalan journalist Zamora granted house arrest after over two years behind bars	GUATEMALA CITY — A Guatemalan judge on Friday ruled that jailed journalist Jose Zamora can leave prison and be held in house arrest after more than 800 days behind bars. Zamora, a well-known journalist who founded the now-defunct elPeriodico newspaper and whose work has criticized successive governments, was arrested in July 2022 on money laundering charges. He has argued that he was a political prisoner due to his work. Zamora was in 2023 sentenced to six years in prison for money laundering. An appeals court later overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial for 2025. Judge Erick Garcia on Friday argued that Zamora's time in preventative prison had reached its limit, in line with human rights standards. 'We are imposing house arrest,' Garcia said in his ruling. 'He is also forbidden to leave the country without judicial authorization.' 'I am very satisfied. I appreciate what is happening,' Zamora said after the decision. The United Nations in August said Zamora was being held in conditions that may amount to torture, citing a report from a panel of experts, and called on authorities to address allegations of inhumane conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guatemalan-journalist-zamora-granted-house-arrest-after-over-two-years-behind-bars/7828445.html	2024-10-18T23:00:53-07:00	
Pyongyang says it has recovered remains of South Korean drone	seoul, south korea — North Korea claimed Saturday it had discovered the remains of at least one crashed South Korean military drone in the capital Pyongyang, releasing images of the device that some analysts confirmed was South Korean. The nuclear-armed North recently accused Seoul of using drones to drop anti-regime propaganda leaflets on the capital. Pyongyang's defense ministry spokesperson said security authorities found the remains of a crashed drone during a search of the North Korean capital on October 13, the official KCNA news agency reported. The North's investigation 'scientifically proved that the drone came from the ROK,' the unnamed spokesperson said, using South Korea's official acronym. South Korea's military initially denied sending drones but has subsequently declined to comment. 'There is no value in verifying or responding to North Korea's unilateral claims,' it said in a brief statement Saturday. North Korea has previously warned it would consider it 'a declaration of war' if another drone was detected. The North Korean official claimed the drone was of the same type as a vehicle-mounted drone publicly displayed by the South Korean military during an Armed Forces Day event in Seoul on October 1 last year. KCNA released several images of what it claimed was the recovered drone, including one showing it lodged in a tree and others featuring North Koreans who appeared to be officials. Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said that based on the images released by the North, the drone was 'clearly a long-range reconnaissance small drone used by ... the South Korean military.' 'It is the same model that our military showcased during the Armed Forces Day event last year,' he told AFP. North 'sending troops to Russia' Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said if the North's allegations are true, it could mean the South 'had been conducting reconnaissance (in the North) with military drones.' But the North Korean official appeared to slightly amend Pyongyang's previous claim that the South used the drones to drop propaganda leaflets over the North Korean capital. 'It is quite likely that the drone is the one which scattered leaflets over the center of Pyongyang Municipality,' he said, but added: 'But the conclusion has not yet been drawn.' Relations between the two sides have deteriorated since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in January defined Seoul as his country's 'principal enemy' and said the North was no longer interested in reunification. The latest developments came a day after South Korea's spy agency said Pyongyang had decided to send a 'large-scale' troop deployment to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, with 1,500 special forces already in Russia's Far East and undergoing training. 'North Korea is currently sending elite troops to Russia and providing weapons,' analyst Hong said, noting that Pyongyang now needs to better manage its internal military resources after diverting special forces and equipment to help Moscow. 'So this seems to be a response that emphasizes preventing a recurrence rather than escalating tensions with South Korea,' he added. Pyongyang has itself sent drones southwards -- in 2022, five North Korean drones crossed the border, prompting the South Korean military to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets. The jets failed to shoot down any of the drones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pyongyang-says-it-has-recovered-remains-of-south-korean-drone/7828461.html	2024-10-18T22:37:09-07:00	
Japan's ruling party headquarters is attacked with firebombs, media report	TOKYO — A man threw several firebombs into the headquarters of Japan's ruling party in Tokyo Saturday, public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media reported. There were no reports of injuries. The man, who was arrested on the spot, had driven his car into nearby fencing, the news reports said. His motive for the attack was not immediately clear. Tokyo police declined to comment, noting the matter was still under investigation. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is increasingly unpopular with the public due to a ballooning money scandal involving dubious funding and suspected tax evasion. The party declined to comment on Saturday's attack, referring all queries to the police. Voting for the lower house of Parliament is set for October 27. Some tarnished politicians lost the official backing of the ruling party but are running as independents. The party recently chose a new leader, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, hoping to present a new image. But polls show its popularity plummeting, although it's still unclear whether they will lose their majority grip on the lower house in the upcoming election given the splintered opposition. Some candidates have been heckled, which is relatively rare in Japanese culture. The Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan almost incessantly over recent decades. They are credited with leading Japan as it became an economic powerhouse from the devastation of World War II. Then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated in 2022, while making a speech for a ruling party candidate during a parliamentary election. The killer used a handmade firearm, saying he resented Abe because his mother gave all the family money to the Unification Church, and he saw Abe as affiliated with that church. Such ties are still ongoing with some ruling party politicians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ruling-party-headquarters-is-attacked-with-firebombs-media-report/7828454.html	2024-10-18T22:04:10-07:00	
Cuba slowly starts restoring power after island-wide blackout	HAVANA — Cuba restored a trickle of power to its grid by mid-evening Friday, officials said, hours after the island plunged into a countrywide blackout following the collapse of one of its major power plants. The vast majority of the country's 10 million residents were still in the dark Friday night, but scattered pockets of the capital Havana, including some of the city's major hospitals, saw lights flicker back on shortly after dark. Grid operator UNE said it hoped to restart at least five of its oil-fired generation plants overnight, providing enough electricity, it said, to begin returning power to broader areas of the country. The Communist-run government closed schools and non-essential industry early on Friday and sent most state workers home in a last-ditch effort to keep the lights on after weeks of severe power shortages. Recreational and cultural activities, including nightclubs, were also ordered closed. But shortly before midday, the Antonio Guiteras power plant, the country's largest and most efficient, went offline, prompting a total grid failure and suddenly leaving the entire island without power. Officials said late Friday they were working to fix the problem that had led the oil-fired plant to fail. They did not specify the cause of its collapse. The blackout marks a new low point on an island where life has become increasingly unbearable, with residents suffering from shortages of food, fuel, water and medicine. Virtually all commerce in Havana ground to a halt Friday. Many residents sat sweating on doorsteps. Tourists hunkered down in frustration. By nightfall, the city was almost completely enveloped in darkness. 'We went to a restaurant and they had no food because there was no power, now we are also without internet,' said Brazilian tourist Carlos Roberto Julio, who had recently arrived in Havana. 'In two days, we have already had several problems.' Prime Minister Manuel Marrero this week blamed worsening blackouts during the past several weeks on a perfect storm well-known to most Cubans - deteriorating infrastructure, fuel shortages and rising demand. 'The fuel shortage is the biggest factor,' Marrero said in a televised message to the nation. Strong winds that began with Hurricane Milton last week have crippled the island's ability to deliver scarce fuel from boats offshore to its power plants, officials said. Reduced fuel Cuba's government also blames the U.S. trade embargo, as well as sanctions under then-President Donald Trump, for difficulties in acquiring fuel and spare parts to operate its oil-fired plants. 'The complex scenario is caused primarily by the intensification of the economic war and financial and energy persecution of the United States,' Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on X on Thursday. A White House National Security Council spokesperson said, 'The United States is not to blame for today's blackout on the island, or the overall energy situation in Cuba.' A State Department official said late Friday that Washington was closely monitoring the potential humanitarian impact of the blackout but that the Cuban government had not requested assistance. For many Cubans, far removed from politics and accustomed to regular power outages, the nationwide blackout was nothing more than a normal Friday night. Carlos Manuel Pedre said he had defaulted to simple pleasures to pass the time. 'In the times we're living in, with everything happening in our country, the most logical entertainment is dominoes,' he said as he played the popular game with friends. 'We're in total crisis.' While demand for electricity has grown in recent years alongside Cuba's fledgling private sector, fuel supply has fallen sharply. Cuba's largest oil supplier, Venezuela, has reduced shipments to the island to an average of 32,600 barrels per day in the first nine months of the year, barely half the 60,000 bpd sent in the same period of 2023, according to vessel-monitoring data and internal shipping documents from Venezuela's state company PDVSA. PDVSA, whose refining infrastructure is also ailing, has this year tried to avoid a new wave of fuel scarcity at home, leaving smaller volumes available for export to allied countries like Cuba. Russia and Mexico, which in the past have sent fuel to Cuba, have also greatly reduced shipments. The shortfalls have left Cuba to fend for itself on the far costlier spot market at a time when its government is nearly bankrupt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-slowly-starts-restoring-power-after-island-wide-blackout/7828453.html	2024-10-18T21:55:25-07:00	
Drone maker DJI sues Pentagon over Chinese military listing	WASHINGTON — China-based DJI sued the U.S. Defense Department on Friday for adding the drone maker to a list of companies allegedly working with Beijing's military, saying the designation is wrong and has caused the company significant financial harm. DJI, the world's largest drone manufacturer that sells more than half of all U.S. commercial drones, asked a U.S. District Judge in Washington to order its removal from the Pentagon list designating it as a 'Chinese military company,' saying it 'is neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military.' Being placed on the list represents a warning to U.S. entities and companies about the national security risks of conducting business with them. DJI's lawsuit says because of the Defense Department's 'unlawful and misguided decision' it has 'lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies.' The company added 'U.S. and international customers have terminated existing contracts with DJI and refuse to enter into new ones.' The Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DJI said on Friday it filed the lawsuit after the Defense Department did not engage with the company over the designation for more than 16 months, saying it 'had no alternative other than to seek relief in federal court.' Amid strained ties between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions Washington has taken in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies that it says may strengthen Beijing's military. Many major Chinese firms are on the list, including aviation company AVIC, memory chip maker YMTC, China Mobile 0941.HK, and energy company CNOOC. In May, lidar manufacturer Hesai Group ZN80y.F filed a suit challenging the Pentagon's Chinese military designation for the company. On Wednesday, the Pentagon removed Hesai from the list but said it will immediately relist the China-based firm on national security grounds. DJI is facing growing pressure in the United States. Earlier this week DJI told Reuters that Customs and Border Protection is stopping imports of some DJI drones from entering the United States, citing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. DJI said no forced labor is involved at any stage of its manufacturing. U.S. lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns that DJI drones pose data transmission, surveillance and national security risks, something the company rejects. Last month, the U.S. House voted to bar new drones from DJI from operating in the U.S. The bill awaits U.S. Senate action. The Commerce Department said last month it is seeking comments on whether to impose restrictions on Chinese drones that would effectively ban them in the U.S. -- similar to proposed Chinese vehicle restrictions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-maker-dji-sues-pentagon-over-chinese-military-listing/7828439.html	2024-10-18T21:10:23-07:00	
Mexican newspaper offices hit by gunfire in Sinaloa state capital	MEXICO CITY — Assailants fired a dozen gunshots at a building housing the newspaper El Debate in the embattled northern Mexico state of Sinaloa, the media outlet said Friday. The newspaper is based in the state capital, Culiacan, where rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel have been staging bloody battles. The newspaper said it found at least four bullet impacts on the building's walls, and more gunfire hit newspaper vehicles parked in front of the offices late Thursday. The paper said that no one was injured. The Mexican Media Alliance, a press freedom group, called it 'a direct attack against press freedom and right of the public to be informed.' El Debate said that the assailants arrived in two vehicles and stopped briefly in front of the building. One gunman got out and opened fire with a rifle, before they sped off. Threats against journalists and their sources have increased exponentially since the latest round of factional fighting broke out after two Sinaloa drug capos — one from each faction — flew to the United States and were arrested there. Drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after flying there in a small plane on July 25. Zambada later claimed he was kidnapped and forced aboard the plane by Guzmán López, causing a violent battle between Zambada's faction and the 'Chapitos' group led by the sons of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán. Journalists have reported being stopped by gunmen on roadways outside Culiacan and told they couldn't cover the continuing gun battles happening on the outskirts of the city on an almost daily basis. The fear is well founded; in 2022, one of El Debate's columnists, Luis Enrique Ramírez, was abducted and killed in Culiacan. His beaten body was found wrapped in plastic on a dirt road outside the city. In 2017, Javier Valdez — an award-winning reporter for the weekly publication Rio Doce who specialized in covering drug trafficking and organized crime — was slain in Sinaloa's state capital. Ismael Bojórquez, Rio Doce's director, said that 'as in other wars, we journalists are the ones who get caught in the crossfire.' Adrian López, the director of El Noroeste, another local newspaper, agreed with the war analogy. 'This obliges us to rethink the protocols and how we cover events in this context, because, sadly, it is practically a war at certain times,' López said. There is little doubt that the warring cartel factions in Sinaloa want to intimidate the media into not reporting on their battles, and that has forced local residents to turn largely to social media for reports on when it might be safe to go out, and where the danger is. Those social media platforms were full on Friday of videos of burning vehicles, bodies and cartel convoys speeding through towns. As usual, there was no confirmation of that from state authorities, who have consistently tried to downplay the violence. On Thursday, hours before the attack on the newspaper, Sinaloa Gov. Ruben Rocha said 'there is nothing to worry about' and 'everything is under control.' But the truth leaks out around the edges: Sinaloa State University told students that it was canceling in-person classes Friday because of 'the acts of violence in and around the Sinaloa state capital.' Those online videos sometimes depict scenes that could reasonably be compared to a war: Two weeks ago in a town north of Culiacan, a passing driver filmed a military helicopter hovering over four gunmen in helmets and tactical vests just yards from a highway. The gunmen had crashed their truck into a telephone pole, but were shooting back at the chopper. However, the online rumor mill is sometimes unreliable. The Sinaloa Red Cross was forced to issue a statement late Thursday denying reports that two paramedics had been kidnapped along with their ambulance in an outlying town where fighting has been especially fierce. But even the Red Cross was spooked. It was careful to say that 'it is important to stress that the Mexican Red Cross is not taking any side in the conflict.' State prosecutors were largely left hamstrung after the chief state prosecutor resigned after allegedly submitting false information about the July 25 killing of an opponent of Gov. Rocha. And the entire municipal force in Culiacan has been temporarily disarmed by soldiers to check their guns, something that's been done in the past when the army suspects that police officers are working for drug cartels. President Claudia Sheinbaum limited her response to the shots fired at the newspaper to a few words. 'First, obviously, to condemn these acts, and investigations are being carried out,' Sheinbaum said. The state is governed by her Morena party, and she has strongly backed Rocha.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-newspaper-offices-hit-by-gunfire-in-sinaloa-state-capital/7828433.html	2024-10-18T20:45:17-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine each bring home 95 prisoners of war in swap brokered by UAE	Russia and Ukraine carried out a new exchange of prisoners of war on Friday, each side bringing home 95 prisoners in an agreement in which the United Arab Emirates acted as mediator. Russia's Defense Ministry, in a post on the Telegram messaging app, said the returning Russian service members were undergoing medical checks in Belarus, one of Russia's closest allies in the more than 2-1/2-year-old war. Video posted on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Telegram account showed men, some wrapped in the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag, getting off a bus well after dark and being embraced by loved ones. A Russian military video showed smiling soldiers boarding buses. 'Every time Ukraine rescues its people from Russian captivity, we get closer to the day when freedom will be returned to all who are in Russian captivity,' Zelenskyy wrote. The president said the freed prisoners had served on various fronts, including some who had defended the port city of Mariupol for nearly three months in 2022. Ukrainian news reports said the returnees included Ukrainian journalist and rights advocate Maksym Butkevych, convicted by a Russian court of shooting at Russian forces. The body coordinating the affairs of prisoners of war said 48 of the returnees had been handed sentences by the Russian judicial system. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament's commissioner for human rights, said the release was the 58th since the beginning of the war and brought to 3,767 the total number of prisoners returned home. A private Russian group that says it looks after the interests of prisoners of war published a list of returnees and said most of them were captured in the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces staged an incursion in August. In his remarks, Zelenskyy again referred to soldiers in that operation who 'replenish the exchange fund,' meaning the capture of Russian prisoners to be used as a bargaining chip in exchanges. Ukrainian forces remain in Kursk, though Russia's military says its forces have clawed back some of the captured territory. A statement from the UAE's Foreign Ministry, reported by state media, said it was the Gulf state's ninth instance of mediation in the war. It described the exchange as 'a reflection of the cooperative and friendly relations between the UAE and both countries.' The last known prisoner swap — involving 103 prisoners from each side — took place in September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-each-bring-home-95-prisoners-of-war-in-swap-brokered-by-uae/7828425.html	2024-10-18T19:59:26-07:00	
US lawmakers seek investigation of consulting firm over work in China	washington — A group of Republican lawmakers is demanding a federal investigation into the U.S. consulting firm McKinsey over its work with the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, even as the company reportedly is revamping its China business to reduce risks. A letter — signed by Representative John Moolenaar of Michigan, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa — asks the Justice Department to investigate whether McKinsey's $480 million contracts with the Defense Department comply with federal law when the consulting firm also advised China's national and provincial governments and state-controlled businesses. The three accuse McKinsey of misrepresenting its relationship with the Chinese government. 'McKinsey's activities pose a serious risk to U.S. national security and may have failed to meet McKinsey's obligations under federal law,' according to the letter dated Thursday. McKinsey declined to comment on the letter but has in the past defended its practices in China. It has said it follows the 'most rigorous and comprehensive client service policy in our industry.' The consultancy also has said it does not work for the ruling Chinese Communist Party or the central government but mainly with multinationals and private Chinese businesses. The lawmakers' scrutiny over McKinsey's dealings with Beijing comes as the U.S. and China are becoming increasingly competitive, prompting American politicians to reexamine business ties to ensure Beijing and its military would not get stronger with U.S. help. Beijing also has grown wary of American companies. The Biden administration has imposed export controls to block China's access to advanced computer chips and limited U.S. investments in China in areas such as microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence. Last month, a Republican congressional report raised red flags that partnerships between American and Chinese universities could aid Beijing in developing critical technology for military advances. U.S. companies, which have built experience in China over the past several decades, are readjusting to the new geopolitical reality. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKinsey has cut back on government-linked clients in China and reduced the workforce there by nearly 500 people, or about a third. The letter by Republican lawmakers accused McKinsey of helping China 'rapidly develop its military and economy' through its consulting services. It said McKinsey failed to disclose its work with the Chinese government while acquiring U.S. defense contracts, which amounted to more than $480 million since 2008 and granted McKinsey 'access to classified or otherwise sensitive national security data.' Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global managing partner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee's subcommittee on investigations in February that 'we've never worked for the Chinese Communist Party or the central government in China, to the best of my knowledge.' The letter asserted that McKinsey may have misrepresented its relationship with the Chinese government, citing public information and documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-investigation-of-consulting-firm-over-work-in-china-/7828385.html	2024-10-18T19:43:40-07:00	
Biden in Germany for quick visit focused on Middle East, Ukraine	US President Joe Biden met with European counterparts on Friday, in a brief trip to Germany where leaders discussed the war in Ukraine and the widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump breaks his silence on Sinwar as Harris seizes opportunity in his death	washington — Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday reiterated her call to end the bloodshed in Gaza, underscoring that the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar creates an opportunity 'to end this war and bring the hostages home.' She spoke between campaign events in Michigan, a state home to the largest percentage of Arab Americans in the country, many of whom are outraged over the Biden administration's support of Israel's targeting of Hamas militants, which has caused tens of thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths. A day earlier, in a carefully choreographed move between the White House and her campaign, the Democratic nominee delivered presidential-style remarks on Israel's killing of Sinwar, declaring that 'justice has been served.' 'It is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power,' said Harris, speaking between campaign events in Wisconsin, minutes after the White House released a statement on Sinwar's death from President Joe Biden, who was at the time aboard Air Force One en route to Berlin for Ukraine-focused meetings with leaders. The speed with which Harris made her statement stood in stark contrast to her Republican rival Donald Trump, who often weighs in on foreign policy issues but stayed quiet on Sinwar until late Friday afternoon when he was asked by a reporter. The former president was also in Michigan, courting Arab American votes. Sinwar 'was not a good person,' Trump said, saying that his death would make achieving peace 'easier.' He praised Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while attacking the Biden administration. 'He's called me. I haven't spoken to him. I'm going to speak to him probably now,' Trump said of the Israeli leader. 'Biden is trying to hold him back,' Trump said, without saying whether he was referring to Israel's operation in Gaza, Lebanon or both. 'And he probably should be doing the opposite, actually.' Polls suggest most Americans would like to see the conflict in Gaza resolved. The candidates' noticeably distinct responses highlight the complicated politics at play ahead of the U.S. November election. Harris addressing vulnerability In her remarks on Sinwar's death, Harris employed tough language, vowing to bring to justice terrorists who threaten American interests, underscoring support for Israel's right to defend itself, and the need to eliminate Hamas. But as pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside her campaign event, Harris also highlighted her goal for Palestinians to 'realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.' In doing so, Harris is seeking to present a strong image as a commander in chief and address her campaign's main foreign policy vulnerability, the crisis in the Middle East, said Thomas Schwartz, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. U.S. support for Israel's military campaign has threatened Harris' standing with key groups who traditionally vote Democratic – young, progressive voters, Arab and Muslim Americans. With less than three weeks until the U.S. election, a winding down of the war could boost Harris' electoral prospects, Schwartz told VOA. Whether it could save her in states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, where many voters are concerned about Gaza, is unclear, he added, but 'it would help.' In a recent interview with Fox News, Harris insisted her administration 'will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.' However, she has resisted pressure to break from Biden's backing of Netanyahu. She has sought to balance her loyalty to Biden with her own worldview, offering slight divergence from his positions in her public statements without committing that her administration would bring major changes in U.S. policies toward Israel. 'The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,' she said in a recent '60 Minutes' interview. The vice president is frequently vocal in her empathy toward Palestinian suffering, calling out Israel via social media Sunday to 'urgently do more to facilitate the flow of aid to those in need,' implying the country is not respecting international humanitarian law as it restricts food supply in northern Gaza. On the same day as Harris' tweet, the Biden administration sent a letter to Israel seeking to improve Palestinians' access to food and other necessities, warning the lack of humanitarian aid could lead to restrictions in U.S. military assistance. In the same week, Washington announced it is deploying 100 American troops to Israel to operate a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, a $1 billion weapon to defend Israel against missiles from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon. Human rights activists have accused the administration of a double standard – pushing Israel to take more steps to protect civilians while supplying them with arms. 'Most pro-Israel American president' Trump often boasts he is the most 'pro-Israel American president' and has sought to erode Jewish American voters' support for his rival by claiming that Jews who vote for Democrats 'hate Israel.' On the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, Trump said the American presidential election will be the most important day not only in the history of the U.S. but also Israel. 'The anti-Jewish has returned even here in America in our streets, our media and our college campuses and within the ranks of the Democrat Party in particular,' he said. Polls show the majority of American Jews are Democrats and tend to vote for Democratic candidates. Analysts find Trump's relative quiet on Sinwar perplexing. Trump has said in the past he encouraged Netanyahu to 'get your victory and get it over with.' 'He doesn't seem to want to get deeply enmeshed right now,' Schwartz said. 'I think he recognizes that the Middle East is more of a problem for the Harris-Walz ticket than it is for him.' With his 'America First' doctrine, Trump also must consider many of his supporters who are against American entanglements in foreign wars, said Khaled Elgindy, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Trump realizes that it's a dual-edged sword, Elgindy told VOA. 'He can tout his pro-Israel credentials, but beyond that, talking about wars and counterterrorism is a kind of much stickier situation and a slippery slope perhaps for his electoral base.' What happens next White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sinwar was one of the main obstacles to securing a cease-fire in Gaza and his killing could accelerate diplomatic talks. 'That's something we're going to have to talk about with our Israeli counterparts,' he said Thursday. It's unclear whether there is a viable replacement in Hamas’ leadership who can negotiate a cease-fire, or whether Israel sees the urgency to return to talks. 'The focus for Israel right now is not Gaza, it is Lebanon, and it is Iran,' said Jonathan Rynhold, professor of politics at Bar-Ilan University. He told VOA that Israel sees an opportunity to weaken Hezbollah, Iran's proxy in Lebanon, a goal shared by American allies in the region. Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank, warned U.S. policymakers not to succumb to hawkish voices pushing to allow Israel to 'reshuffle the regional security deck' following Sinwar's death and the weakening of Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'We've seen these kinds of blunders before,' he told VOA, 'through hubris and through overreach.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-breaks-his-silence-on-sinwar-as-harris-seizes-opportunity-in-his-death-/7828406.html	2024-10-18T18:43:55-07:00	
UN Security Council expands Haiti arms embargo	The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously on Friday to expand an arms embargo on Haiti as the impoverished Caribbean nation struggles to wrest control from powerful gangs. All 15 members voted for the resolution, which calls for U.N. member states to block shipments of 'arms and related materiel of all types' from entering Haiti. A previous embargo targeted only small arms and ammunition. The resolution, drafted by Ecuador and the United States, also includes a one-year renewal of a committee for monitoring sanctions against certain Haitians. The Security Council first approved the sanctions regime in October 2022, but at the time the measures targeted only one gang leader, Jimmy Cherizier, who uses the alias 'Barbecue.' In late February, Cherizier launched a coordinated gang revolt in the capital Port-au-Prince, which eventually resulted in the country's unelected prime minister stepping down and handing power to a transitional council. Since then, an interim prime minister has taken office and a Kenyan-led multinational force has arrived in the country to prop up Haiti's struggling police force, though gangs continue to wield wide control. In early October, an attack by the Gran Grif gang in the town of Pont Sonde left at least 109 people dead and dozens wounded in one of the worst massacres in the nation's recent history. The leader of the gang, Luckson Elan, had been added days earlier to the U.N. sanctions list, which now includes seven individuals. U.S. representative Dorothy Shea told the Council on Friday that the situation in Haiti 'remains dire.' 'The United States remains deeply concerned by the security and humanitarian crises in Haiti. Too many people continue to suffer from ongoing violence,' she said. Kenya is set to send 600 additional police officers in November for the support mission, which was approved by the U.N. Security Council last year but is not a U.N. peacekeeping mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-security-council-expands-haiti-arms-embargo-/7828400.html	2024-10-18T18:27:20-07:00	
Striking machinists, Boeing confer indirectly, aided by US government	A union representing striking machinists at Boeing said Friday that it was 'actively engaged in indirect discussions' with the plane maker that were being facilitated by Acting U.S. Labor Secretary Julie Su. 'We are fully committed to these talks. It is our responsibility to attempt to reach a resolution,' the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 751 said in a social media post. About 33,000 of Boeing's unionized West Coast workers, most in Washington state, have been on strike since September 13, demanding a 40% wage increase spread over four years and a restoration of workers' defined benefit pension. The work stoppage has halted production of the company's best-selling 737 Max and its 767 and 777 wide-body aircraft. The talks are the first sign of movement in the strike since October 8, when Boeing - following the breakdown of talks attended by mediators -withdrew its enhanced offer that included a 30% wage increase over four years. Boeing subsequently filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union. Boeing declined to comment on Friday. On Monday, Su was in Seattle for her first in-person effort to help reach a new Boeing contract and returned on Thursday night to resume efforts after a trip to Detroit. A spokesperson for Su said Friday that the secretary 'is currently in Seattle having discussions with both parties. She has met with the CEO and the union and has been in touch multiple times throughout the process.' Last Friday, Boeing announced it would cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global staff, and take $5 billion in charges, continuing a year of tumult for the company since a new Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 airplane suffered a midair emergency. Boeing announced a window for up to $25 billion in stock and debt offerings over the next three years on Tuesday, as well as a $10 billion credit agreement. In September, nearly 95% of the West Coast workers rejected Boeing's contract offer of a 25% pay increase over four years, prompting the strike.	https://www.voanews.com/a/striking-machinists-boeing-confer-indirectly-aided-by-us-government-/7828178.html	2024-10-18T16:59:50-07:00	
Venezuela's Maduro names to Cabinet ally released by US in prisoner swap	caracas, venezuela — Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday appointed to his Cabinet a close ally who was pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden last year as part of a prisoner swap and following assurances that Venezuela would hold a fair presidential election in 2024. Maduro named Alex Saab minister of industry and national production and tasked him with promoting 'the development of the entire industrial system of Venezuela within the framework' of what he called a 'new economic model.' Maduro made the announcement on the messaging app Telegram. Saab returned to Venezuela a free man in December after being in custody since 2020, when authorities in Cape Verde arrested him on a U.S. warrant for money-laundering charges. U.S. prosecutors long regarded him as a bagman for Maduro. The president secured his release and clemency in a deal conducted with the Biden administration. In exchange for Saab, Maduro released 10 Americans and a fugitive defense contractor known as 'Fat Leonard' who was wanted for his alleged role at the center of a massive Pentagon bribery scandal. The largest release of American prisoners in Venezuela's history took place weeks after the White House granted the South American country a broad reprieve from economic sanctions, following a commitment by Maduro to work with the political opposition toward free and fair conditions for the 2024 presidential election. The U.S. ended the sanctions relief earlier this year after hopes for a democratic opening faded. Last month, it responded to Venezuela's highly disputed July presidential election by sanctioning 16 of Maduro's allies, accusing them of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses. Saab was arrested in 2020 during a fuel stop en route to Iran to negotiate oil deals on behalf of Maduro's government. The U.S. charges were conspiracy to commit money laundering tied to a bribery scheme that allegedly siphoned off $350 million through state contracts to build affordable housing. Saab was also sanctioned for allegedly running a scheme that stole hundreds of millions in dollars from food-import contracts at a time of widespread hunger mainly due to shortages in the South American country. After his arrest, Maduro's government said Saab was a special envoy on a humanitarian mission and was entitled to diplomatic immunity from criminal prosecution under international law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-maduro-appoints-ally-pardoned-by-us-in-prisoner-swap-to-cabinet/7828158.html	2024-10-18T16:41:15-07:00	
Muslim candidates surge in local elections in US	WASHINGTON — As the United States prepares for a presidential election next month, the idyllic New York suburb of Teaneck, New Jersey, is gearing up for elections that reflect a broader trend in U.S. politics. Two Muslim women are running for local office in Teaneck, a town of 41,000 residents with a significant Muslim population. They are among hundreds of Muslim candidates in local, state and federal elections around the country. Teaneck once had a Muslim mayor but never a Muslim woman on its city council. Reshma Khan, a longtime local activist of Indian origin and a council candidate, is aiming to change that. 'I don't take that lightly,' Khan, 47, said in a recent phone interview from her makeshift canvassing base in Teaneck. 'It's one of great responsibility as a Muslim.' Nadia Hussain, a Trinidadian American high school teacher, is the other Muslim candidate in Teaneck's nonpartisan local elections. She is hoping to be the first Muslim woman elected to the local school board. The two hijab-wearing, everyday working American moms represent a growing trend of Muslim Americans seeking office, reflecting a larger national pattern of more diverse candidates. 'There is a saying that we have: 'If you're not at the table, then you're on the menu,' so engagement is a must,' Hussain said in an interview with VOA. Muslims' political engagement surges The U.S. has roughly 3.5 million Muslims from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Though most vote Democratic, a growing number have leaned Republican in recent elections. Muslim elected officials, once a rarity, have become increasingly common in recent years. This surge in political engagement is driven by a mix of factors, from a concern about Islamophobia to a desire for political representation, experts say. 'If voter turnout of American Muslims is any indication of further political participation, Muslims running for office seems to parallel that trend,' said Nura Sediqe, an assistant professor of political science at Michigan State University. Some experts trace the surge of Muslim political engagement to 2018, when Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib shattered glass ceilings by becoming the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Their success, coupled with that of numerous local candidates, ignited a wave of Muslim political activism. The ripple effects have continued in the years since. In 2021, Boston and New York City elected their first Muslim council members. The following year, Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a substantial Arab and Muslim population, inaugurated its first Muslim mayor. Meanwhile, state legislatures from Maine to Texas have welcomed about 50 Muslim members into their ranks. 'Every cycle we're seeing an increase in the number of people running,' said Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action, himself a school board president near the Sacramento, California, area. 'You're seeing more local races, more school board races and more city council races where folks are running in.' Last year, CAIR, a civil rights group promoting American-Islamic relations, tallied 235 Muslim elected officials, including nearly 50 in New Jersey, home to the largest Muslim population per capita in the country. This year, the group expects the total number to surpass 250, a record. Local races, like school board and city council elections, account for most of the recent growth. A city council member may not wield the power of a member of Congress, but in a country where 'all politics is local,' these races can have a huge impact on local communities. Recounting her talking points to voters, Khan said, 'We say, yes, the presidential election is important, but more important is local elections.' A consummate activist, Khan views a future role on the city council as an extension of her activism rather than a political position. Her goal, she said, is to inspire future generations of Muslim women. 'I'm not doing this for myself,' Khan said. 'I am doing this for the Fatimas and the Muhammads and the Ahmads who are going to come 50 years from now.' Candidate aims to challenge stereotypes Khan wasn't always a hijabi woman. Born in Chennai, India, she attended a Catholic school. After earning an master's degree in business administration from an Indian university, she moved to the U.S. in early 2001 to take a marketing job in New Jersey. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, changed her outlook. To challenge stereotypes about Muslims, she began wearing a hijab. 'I wanted to show that there are peaceful Muslims,' she said. Nearly 20 years ago, Khan and her husband, Arif, moved to Teaneck, where she immersed herself in community activism: attending city council meetings, serving on the council's community relations board and leading a school Parent Teacher Association. Then in 2021, she was thrust into the spotlight after helping lead a ballot initiative to move local elections from May to November when turnout is higher. She credits her marketing skills for the success of the 'One Town, One Vote' campaign. 'At this point, I had become such an icon in Teaneck, because even though the movement was not started by me, I brought my marketing skills,' she said. The following year, she considered running for town council but decided to wait while she was raising three young daughters. This year, though, she took the plunge, inspired by the success of other Muslim women in New Jersey and a sense the council wasn't listening to her community. 'I felt that I should be the leader for my community, so my community finds a voice in American politics,' she said. Teaneck is an ethnically and religiously diverse town, with about 40% of the population Jewish, more than 25% Muslim, and the rest mostly Blacks and Latinos. The war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' terror attack on Israel last October, sparked tensions after the council passed a resolution in support of Israel but not one 'designed to speak for Palestinian voices,' Khan said. Teaneck's Muslims, Khan said, 'feel let down by the local leadership because the local leadership has only spoken for one community.' Teaneck Mayor Mike Pagan did not respond to repeated requests from VOA for comment. A self-described 'bridge builder,' Khan said she has formed a broad coalition of supporters from Teaneck's major communities, using young canvassers to go door to door. Whether that's enough to win remains to be seen. With local elections now held in November, winning a council seat requires substantially more votes.

As a river and a sea die, Uzbekistan learns to live with less water	Termez, Uzbekistan — The Amu Darya, one of two main rivers that for millennia fed the now rapidly shrinking Aral Sea, no longer does. Reporting by VOA along the length of the river in Uzbekistan has confirmed that every drop of water from the Amu Darya — formed by the convergence of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers in the mountains between Afghanistan and Tajikistan — is now diverted for human use. 'The Amu Darya is now fully utilized for agriculture and other economic needs,' said Rustam Saparbayev, deputy chairman of the parliament of Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan's northwestern part, where the river ends its journey to nowhere. Saparbayev told VOA that all the river’s water is directed into five canals in southern Karakalpakstan, lamenting that there isn’t enough water for both the sea and the population. 'This is the hardest decision for us. Our priority is the immediate needs of our people. We rely on the Amu Darya to grow our crops and livestock. Water is extremely scarce in this environment, and we must prioritize food and water security,' he emphasized. In a region already strapped for water, Karakalpakstan faces the most severe environmental challenges and the devastating impact of climate change. The Aral Sea, located largely within its territory, has dramatically shrunk over the past few decades. Over 30,000 people live in Muynak, which was once a bustling Aral Sea port with a thriving fishing industry, but it now lies a dusty several-hour drive from the water. Since the 1970s, many residents have left because of the environmental disaster. Nevertheless, VOA noted significant construction and business growth in the area, which the central government in Tashkent cites as evidence of increased investment in the region. 'The conditions here have improved,' said Murod Jumaboyev, Muynak’s deputy mayor. 'We have been adapting to the climate challenges. 'We still face enormous difficulties with the sea essentially deserted, but we are trying to preserve what remains. With help from our government and the international community, we are revitalizing the area, hoping to turn it into sustainable groves, adopt alternative crops and create a new ecosystem — both environmental and economic,' Jumaboyev said. There is a local 'artemia season,' during which aquatic crustaceans living in the extremely salty waters of what remains of the Aral Sea are harvested for pharmaceutical use. Locals skilled at collecting them sell them to Chinese firms for several hundred dollars per pack. Muynak residents told VOA that their situation has slightly improved but said they rely heavily on remittances from relatives working abroad. 'We are the people of the Aral Sea. The sea may have largely left us, but this is still our land. It may be harder here, but I know it’s not easy anywhere,' said Maksudbek, who works for a travel firm but declined to give his last name. According to Muynak officials, more than 20,000 tourists visited last year, marking a significant increase over previous years. What used to be the shores and shipyards of the Aral Sea are now more than 200 kilometers from the remaining water. It took VOA about four hours in a special jeep to reach the sea. No population inhabits the area — it is too dry and salty even for most wildlife. A couple of campsites, powered by solar energy, have been built in recent years. Workers there told VOA that the water receded by about 50 meters over the past year. Very few tourists make it to the sea; most only tour the former Muynak port, particularly the 'graveyard of ships,' where rusting vessels sit on a desert landscape. The Aral Sea appears passive and eerily calm at night. No fish are left, with only a few birds, visible mainly at sunrise and sunset. The gray mud is thought to have therapeutic properties, but the sea’s remoteness makes it difficult to access. Kazakhstan has succeeded in reviving parts of the sea’s northern shores, but from the perspective of the Karakalpaks, who oversee most of it, the Aral Sea is rapidly vanishing. 'We can still save the Aral Sea, but it will require a global effort. No matter what we hear from the U.N. and other organizations, and despite current assistance, there won’t be significant change without concrete action,' said Saparbayev. 'There are international missions to save exotic animals and historic sites. The Aral Sea needs similar attention. In our view, the solution is bringing water — but from outside our region, as it can no longer come from the Amu Darya,' he said. Further upstream, water from the Amu Darya is drawn off for use in the Bukhara, Khorezm and Surkhandarya regions, which have a combined population of 9 million. Farmers and officials there told VOA that water availability currently meets their basic needs. But Afghanistan’s construction of a canal off the Amu Darya is cause for concern. Local leaders hope that the governments of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan can persuade the Taliban to join a water-sharing agreement, something a regional working group is expected to draft. 'We trust that our government is doing everything possible,' said Umid Akhmedov, Surkhandarya’s lead specialist on water resources. 'We haven’t felt the impact of the Afghan canal yet, but if and when it draws more water, we will have to adapt. We are already implementing new water-use and preservation methods.' The Amu Zang canal is the first channel formed as the Amu Darya enters Uzbekistan. Speaking to VOA from this area, Akhmedov explained that Surkhandarya depends on this water. 'We don’t use it for drinking since it’s very muddy, but for everything else, it’s a critical resource.' In Khorezm, with its desert climate, summers are cooler along the Amu Darya and traditional tea houses and restaurants — sometimes on boats — are popular, particularly around the regional capital, Urgench, and the historic city of Khiva. VOA saw a similar scene in Karakalpakstan, specifically in Amu Darya District, where a new bridge over the river has eased transit and expanded business opportunities. However, fishermen told VOA that fish are now scarce in the river, with most of what is sold as 'Amu fish' coming from the farms drawing water from the river. Scarcity, extreme depletion, and decline — these words dominate every conversation about water in Uzbekistan, reflecting a challenging reality and growing concern about the future. People blame Soviet-era irrigation and emphasize the need for regional cooperation to produce solutions. 'We are doing our part by using the water for our most critical needs. The Amu Darya still reaches us, but it no longer feeds the Aral Sea. We hope the world will help us save it,' said Saparbayev. In addition to the Surkhandarya region, reporting for this story also took place in Khorezm and Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan.

Days of torrential rain bring major flooding to central France	paris — France's prime minister said Friday that firefighters and other rescuers have been involved in about 2,300 operations, some of them lifesaving, in what appears to be the biggest flooding in 40 years in central France. Michel Barnier visited French authorities' crisis center in Paris and said there hadn't been such violent rain in many people's memory. Over 1,000 people were evacuated. Most of them were able to go home Friday. Barnier also praised an alert system, used for the first time, that sent text messages urging people in the concerned areas to delay or cancel their planned trips and stay in a safe place. French weather agency Meteo France said as much as 700 millimeters (27.5 inches) of rain fell in in 48 hours in some local areas in the regions of Ardeche and Lozere. National railway operator SNCF halted regional trains between the cities of Lyon and Saint-Etienne on Thursday, saying the tracks were impassable. Local train services will remain disrupted for several days, it said. The massive floods caused serious damage and power outages Friday in parts of France's mountainous southeast region. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Several French news stations showed cars, cattle and traffic signs being swept away by the floods. The A47, a main highway near Lyon, was temporarily transformed into a giant stream of water and remained closed Friday. Meteo France lifted its red alert for bad weather Friday morning but still warned of potential heavy rain and floods in southwestern France. Some information for this story came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/days-of-torrential-rain-bring-major-flooding-to-central-france/7828107.html	2024-10-18T14:46:33-07:00	
New York Times opens Vietnam bureau amid claims of media repression	bangkok — Vietnam is anxious for international media to tell its story, but a restrictive environment makes accurate and impactful coverage difficult, say media analysts. That conflict of interests will be tested by the decision of The New York Times to open a bureau in the Southeast Asian country, where limited options exist for local independent journalism. The announcement of the newspaper’s return to the country for the first time since 1975 was welcomed by Vietnam’s leadership. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Thi Thu Hang told local media that a New York Times office in Vietnam will provide more news of the country and the region. That, in turn, will help the international community to better understand Vietnam and its people. Le added that she hopes the paper will shine a light on U.S.-Vietnamese relations. Next year will mark 30 years of diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi. The U.S is also Vietnam’s second biggest trading partner and Hanoi’s largest export market. In September 2023 the U.S and Vietnam upgraded diplomatic relations, signing what is called the 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for Peace, Cooperation and Sustainable Development.' Analysts say the agreement will encourage economic trade between the countries. The New York Times’ office in Vietnam will be headed by Damien Cave. The newspaper closed its last office there at the end of the Vietnam War. The New York Times declined VOA’s request for interviews with journalists who cover Southeast Asia, or questions about who will be based in Vietnam. But in a statement last month, it said that Cave will 'explore the economy, culture and challenges of a vibrant, rapidly developing country.' 'The Times’s return to Vietnam is a sign of Asia’s rise as an important economic and political power center,' the statement said. Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Singapore-based political research center the ISEAS Institute, says Vietnam’s government wants to tell the country’s story through the limited international media that operate there. 'Vietnam’s growing economic and political importance has made it a more prominent subject, but outside of a few major news outlets, Western media presence in the country has been relatively limited,' he said. 'The government certainly wants the world to know more about the ‘Vietnam story,’ but I don’t think the perception of international media — or media in general — has changed.' Beh Lih Yi, the Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA that the move by The New York Times is 'encouraging,' despite Vietnam’s 'appalling' media freedom record. 'It is high time for the Vietnamese government to allow more media openness, as the Southeast Asian country transforms into a regional economic powerhouse and a key manufacturing hub in global supply chains,' she said by email. Vietnam is a one-party communist state. The government has complete control over the state’s functions, social organizations and media. Although Vietnam has one of the fastest growing economies in the region, it has a poor reputation on corruption, political censorship, human rights and civic society. That environment has long stifled Vietnam’s press environment. Vietnam has 'an appalling record of censorship. Foreign and local journalists who report in Vietnam face routine targeting and harassment from officials simply for doing their job,' Beh Lih Yi said in her email. 'Journalists have often been arbitrarily detained and jailed on bogus anti-state charges for their independent reporting.' Vietnam ranked as the fifth worst jailer of journalists globally in late 2023, according to CPJ’s annual survey. At least 19 journalists, including Pham Chi Dung who contributed to VOA, were in prison, CPJ found. VOA contacted Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs by email for a comment but did not receive a reply. Although governed under a communist political system, Vietnam’s economy has seen impressive growth in the past decade. A World Bank forecast in October said Vietnam’s gross domestic product could grow 6.5% in 2025, which outpaces any other developing nation in the region. 'While it has growing economic clout, Vietnam must also fulfill its international press freedom obligations by allowing journalists to report freely and safely on the country, otherwise it will undermine investors' confidence,' Beh Lih Yi said. One Vietnamese journalist who works for an international broadcaster outside of Vietnam pointed out that all local media outlets in Vietnam are 'tightly controlled by the Communist Party.' The journalist noted that authorities can still, outside the country's borders, harass media through passport control and travel bans. 'Every editor-in-chief and senior staff member is required to be a party member, and they are appointed by government agencies, meaning there is no private or independent media,' added the journalist, who requested anonymity because of security fears. 'Journalists are prohibited from publishing content that questions the legitimacy of the ruling party, challenges key government policies or criticizes visiting foreign leaders. Reporting critically about the government or the party can result in serious consequences,' the journalist added. The government is more concerned with Vietnamese-language stories, the journalist said. But Vietnamese journalists overseas are also targeted for their work. 'Because we work for free and independent media, we maintain our commitment to reporting both the positives and negatives of the government, always backed by facts. The government is uncomfortable with this. 'While they can control domestic media, they cannot exert the same level of control over us. As a result, they find other ways to pressure us,' the journalist said. 'The dilemma we face is that while we are employed by foreign media organizations, we are still Vietnamese citizens. This gives the Vietnamese government leverage over us — they can revoke or refuse to renew our passports, impose travel bans or restrict our movements.' Vietnam has one of the worst environments for media freedom globally, according to Reporters Without Borders. The country ranks 174 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where number one indicates the best media environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-times-opens-vietnam-bureau-amid-claims-of-media-repression-/7828085.html	2024-10-18T14:32:04-07:00	
Israel denies UN accusations that it's targeting peacekeepers in Lebanon	geneva — A U.N. official Friday accused the Israel Defense Forces of repeatedly targeting U.N. peacekeepers along the blue line, the U.N.-drawn provisional border between Israel and Lebanon. 'We have been targeted several times and deliberately attacked once inside the borders in Naqoura, injuring two peacekeepers,' Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for UNIFIL, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, told journalists in Geneva from Beirut. 'They hit the communication system very close to the bunkers where peacekeepers were sheltering. And there was an instance when IDF troops entered a UNIFIL position and remained there for 45 minutes. 'So, all these elements are clear, and we have been very vocal that these are deliberate attacks against the mission,' he said. Israel has rejected accusations that it is going after the peacekeepers. Thursday, French news agency AFP quoted an Israeli army statement as saying, 'UNIFIL infrastructure sites and forces are not a target.' Israeli forces are operating in southern Lebanon in an attempt to eliminate strongholds of the Hezbollah militant group. Hezbollah blamed The IDF acknowledged injuring two UNIFIL peacekeepers on October 11 when forces fired on what an IDF statement on X called 'an immediate threat.' The IDF has stated that Hezbollah militants in Lebanon deliberately operate near UNIFIL posts and bases, 'thereby endangering UNIFIL personnel.' Despite demands by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the U.N. mission to move its positions away from the blue line, Tenenti said 'there was a unanimous decision from everyone to stay.' 'We need to be here. We need to try to bring back stability and peace to this region,' he said, acknowledging that this was far from easy as exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel in the past month have 'turned the hostilities into a deadlier, more lethal conflict.' He said that incursions into Lebanese territory by the IDF in the proximity of the blue line in both UNIFIL sectors, east and west, 'constitute a violation of Lebanese sovereignty, and also a violation of Security Council Resolution 1701.' The UNIFIL spokesperson described the destruction of many villages along the blue line and said that given the dangers and attacks against UNIFIL, most patrols in the past few weeks have been suspended 'until things improve.' Though U.N. peacekeepers have the right of self-defense, he said that 'we have to be very pragmatic on when to use it and how to use it because we do not want to become part of the conflict and use force that could trigger more violence.' On Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent a message to beleaguered UNIFIL troops, expressing his admiration of and gratitude for the work they are doing under such challenging circumstances. He said all parties have an obligation to ensure 'the safety of our personnel' and that 'the inviolability of U.N. premises must be respected at all times.' 'Attacks against U.N. peacekeepers are completely unacceptable. They are in breach of international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime,' he said. According to Lebanese authorities, more than 2,300 people have been killed and over 11,000 injured since hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel began in October 2023, while more than 1.2 million people have been displaced. West Bank fighting In reviewing the past year, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), noted everyone warned when the Israeli-Gaza war started that the 'region was a powder keg.' Since then, he said, the region has descended into 'some sort of hell with no end in sight and no guarantee that it will not get worse — and part of that is the West Bank.' OCHA’s latest weekly update on the situation in the occupied West Bank showed that conditions there continue to deteriorate. It said Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians, including a child, and injured 104 people, including nine children, in the period October 8-14. 'Israeli forces accused most of those fatalities of being involved in attacking Israelis,' Laerke said. 'Yesterday, a Palestinian woman was reportedly killed while she was harvesting olives in Jenin. That follows 32 attacks by Israeli settlers this month on Palestinians engaged in the olive harvest,' he said. 'Hundreds of olive trees and saplings have been vandalized, sawed off or stolen. The olive harvest is an economic lifeline for tens of thousands of Palestinian families.' Meanwhile, James Elder, a UNICEF spokesperson who recently returned from another mission to Gaza, called the Palestinian enclave 'the real-world embodiment of hell on Earth for its 1 million children.' 'And it is getting worse, day by day, as we see the horrific impact of the daily airstrikes and military operations on Palestinian children,' he said. 'A year ago, the cruel choice for civilians was endure deprivation or flee into displacement. Today, deprivation grips all of Gaza. Being displaced, again, only leads to more suffering and ever worse conditions for children,' he said. Elder noted that last December, UNICEF stated: 'The Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.' Since then, day after day, for more than a year, he said, 'that brutal, evidence-based reality is reinforced.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-israeli-forces-of-attacking-peacekeepers-in-lebanon/7828060.html	2024-10-18T14:19:46-07:00	
Ukraine media outlets, businesses targeted with false bomb threats	Emails threatening terror attacks led to the evacuation of hundreds of businesses, media outlets and foreign embassies in Ukraine this week. Ukrainian national police searched dozens of properties targeted by the threat, including the Kyiv office of VOA sister network Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, according to reports. Police said the searches did not find evidence of explosives. The country’s Foreign Ministry said that about 60 of its foreign diplomatic missions also received the threatening emails, leading some of them to suspend services. The email, which appeared linked to an anti-Ukraine Telegram group, mentioned the names of three journalists with RFE/RL’s Schemes investigative news desk. The journalists recently reported on how Russian intelligence recruits individuals to carry out arson attacks on vehicles belonging to military personnel or conscription center workers. RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said the network is working with authorities in their investigations. 'We will not be intimidated and stand behind our reporters who will continue to bring news to Ukrainian audiences without fear or favor,' said Capus in a statement. At least four other media outlets were targeted, including the Kyiv Independent, Ukrainska Pravda, Liga.net and the public broadcaster Suspilne. The Kyiv Independent reported that the email it received claimed that explosives had been planted in their office, as well as at the RFE/RL office and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. 'I have planted several explosive devices in your building, and very soon it will explode,' the email read. A police search of the Kyiv Independent found no evidence of explosives, the media outlet reported. Police have examined more than 2,000 threatening messages, which they said appear to come from a Russian IP address. A criminal case has been opened for 'knowingly false reports of threat to the safety of citizens.' The messages are described as matching 'the style of Russian intelligence services,' a police statement said, adding that Russia is 'waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, trying to cause mass panic and exhaust the system of state and law enforcement agencies.' The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists denounced the intimidation of RFE/RL’s reporters and called for an investigation. 'Ukrainian authorities must ensure the safety of the journalists and hold the perpetrators to account,' said Gulnoza Said, the CPJ Europe and Central Asia Program coordinator. 'Journalists must be able to work safely, without fear of retaliation.' According to RFE/RL Schemes, the group that claimed responsibility for the alleged planting of explosives has been using social media to spread messages that offer money in exchange for damaging Ukrainian military vehicles. A spokesperson for the Security Service of Ukraine said Russia was trying to make it look like arson attacks are being carried out by Ukrainians instead of being instigated by Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-media-outlets-businesses-targeted-with-false-bomb-threats/7828022.html	2024-10-18T13:52:41-07:00	
Cuba shuts down schools, workplaces after mass blackout hits island	HAVANA — A massive outage left millions of Cubans without power and prompted the government Friday to implement emergency measures to slash demand, including suspending classes, shutting down some state-owned workplaces and canceling non-essential services. Cuban officials said that the blackout, which started late Thursday, saw 1.64 gigawatts go offline during peak hours in the early evening, about half the total demand at the time. 'The situation has worsened in recent days,' Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said in a special address on national television in the early hours of Friday. 'We must be fully transparent ... we have been halting economic activities to ensure energy for the population.' During his address, Marrero was accompanied by Alfredo Lopez, chief of the state-owned utility, UNE, who said the outage stemmed from increased demand from small- and medium-sized companies and residences’ air conditioners, as well as breakdowns in old thermoelectric plants that haven’t been properly maintained and the lack of fuel to operate some facilities. Changes to electricity rates for small- and medium-sized companies, which have proliferated since they were first authorized by the communist government in 2021, are also being considered, Marrero said. Marrero sought to placate people’s concerns about the outage, citing an expected influx of fuel supply from Cuba's state-owned oil company. Even in a country accustomed to frequent outages amid a deepening economic crisis, the size of Thursday night’s blackout left millions of Cubans on edge. Residents shut their doors and windows they typically leave open at night, and candles or lanterns were visible inside their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-shuts-down-schools-workplaces-after-mass-blackout-hits-island/7827965.html	2024-10-18T12:44:09-07:00	
US, allies take lead on North Korea sanctions	A Canadian surveillance plane over the East China Sea — Over the blue waters of the East China Sea, a Canadian air force patrol crew scans the horizon, searching for vessels suspected of making illicit transfers of oil to North Korea. The 20-member crew aboard the Aurora CP-140 is on the front line of a U.S.-led multinational effort to enforce United Nations sanctions that cap North Korea's oil imports. On this clear day in mid-October, the Canadian plane is patrolling international waters off the coast of China — a hotspot, the crew says, for ships attempting to dodge sanctions. When they locate a suspicious vessel, the crew swoops low, circling to snap pictures from multiple angles. The idea is to 'make our presence known,' said Major Doug Publicover, the commander of the Canadian mission. The Canadians pass the information to the Enforcement Coordination Cell, or ECC, a loose configuration of 11 nations that conduct surveillance and share intelligence on North Korea's sanctions violations. 'It's a small piece of the pie,' Publicover said of Canada's contribution, 'but each country does their bit, and hopefully that deterrence can be larger.' Sanctions under strain Since 2006, U.N. Security Council sanctions have restricted much of North Korea's economic activity as punishment for its nuclear and missile programs. The sanctions limit North Korea's annual imports to 4 million barrels of crude oil and 500,000 barrels of refined products. U.S. officials, however, say North Korea regularly exceeds these limits, mainly because of a lack of enforcement by China and Russia — North Korea's key allies. Both countries deny those claims but have taken steps to blunt the impact of the sanctions, which they say are no longer necessary. Earlier this year, Russia vetoed the renewal of a U.N. panel that monitored sanctions violations. China abstained from the vote. As an alternative, the U.S. and its allies this week created the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, or MSMT, which aims to fill the intelligence gap left by the disbanded panel. 'We just collect information, we tabulate it, and we push it off,' says Royal Canadian Air Force Commander Larry Moraal, the ECC's deputy director. '[But] they'll have greater access to the international community than we do.' China pushback As the U.S. and its allies move ahead with sanctions enforcement, China has voiced growing frustration, particularly with patrols near its borders. Chinese military jets have frequently intercepted Canadian and Australian planes on these missions, at times creating tense encounters. During this week's flight, with VOA aboard, Chinese fighter jets shadowed the Canadian plane for hours as it patrolled the East China Sea. Unlike past incidents, though, the interactions were not dangerous, said Publicover. 'We're in their backyard — we expect to have some company,' Publicover said. China's biggest concern is that some flights 'have been seriously approaching or even entered China's airspace,' said Hu Bo, director of the Beijing-based South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative. In 2023, China accused a Canadian CP-140 of entering its airspace near the disputed Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan. The islands are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan. When asked by VOA, Canadian officials declined to comment on the incident, underscoring that all its operations occur in international waters. Philip Shetler-Jones, a senior research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, said it's easy to understand why China doesn't like patrols so close to its borders. 'I don't think many countries would like it. But that's different from having an acceptable legal basis to say it's not OK — or an acceptable legal basis on which to justify the kind of dangerous maneuvers and actions they've carried out,' he said. Going it alone With China and Russia increasingly disengaged from enforcing sanctions, U.S.-led mechanisms like the ECC and MSMT are among the few remaining options. Some experts, however, question how effective this approach can be. 'There's no way the U.S. and its allies on their own could enforce U.N. sanctions' without help from China and Russia, says Peter Ward, a research fellow at the Seoul-based Sejong Institute. Still, Ward said the newly created MSMT can serve as a useful tool for naming and shaming violators, applying pressure, and helping countries struggling to implement sanctions. Maya Ungar, a U.N. analyst at the International Crisis Group, added that the body could boost its credibility by involving a wider range of countries. But, she said, its accusations will likely carry less weight than those from the now-dismantled U.N. panel of experts. How to measure success Despite enforcement efforts, North Korea continues to secure energy imports, often exceeding U.N.-imposed limits. Commander Moraal acknowledges this but said the ECC is raising the cost of sanctions evasion. As an example, Moraal cites two North Korean-linked coal ships seized by South Korea earlier this year after ECC provided intelligence. But if the ultimate goal is to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the results appear less encouraging. Recent estimates suggest North Korea now has enough fissile material to build up to 90 nuclear warheads, and it regularly unveils new advanced missile systems. Ward believes a shift in strategy may eventually be necessary. 'At some point, we may need to reckon with the fact that North Korea does have nuclear weapons and figure out how to deal with that,' he said. Still, even if full enforcement is impossible, Ward argues there's a case for maintaining sanctions. 'The alternative could reward bad behavior,' he said. 'So long as North Korea sanctions remain relatively comprehensive, if very leaky, there are many countries that will see the case of North Korea as a cautionary lesson,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-allies-take-lead-on-n-korea-sanctions-with-less-outside-help/7827879.html	2024-10-18T12:27:12-07:00	
Kenyan court blocks new deputy president choice	nairobi, kenya — A court has blocked Kenya President William Ruto’s nominee for new deputy president a day after lawmakers had voted to remove the former deputy president, Rigathi Gachagua, from office over accusations of gross misconduct and undermining the president. Ruto had wasted no time filling the deputy president position after Gachagua was impeached and removed from office late Thursday. Ruto, who had 14 days to make a choice, nominated Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki to replace Gachagua. A few hours later, Kindiki’s nomination was approved by 236 members of the national assembly who voted yes, with no abstentions and no votes against. Shortly after that, a court in Nairobi intervened and suspended the Thursday senate resolution until it can hear the case on October 24. In a ruling on Friday, the court said that Gachagua's petition against the move to replace him raised 'substantial questions of law and public interest.' Meanwhile, some Kenyans like James Chege say impeaching Gachagua was the right move. 'The outgoing president was too abrasive. He couldn't tone down his language. He seemed divisive, so I support the move for the president to nominate Professor Kindinki,' Chege said. 'He's somebody who's calm, a worker. I hope he'll do a good job supporting the president, the cabinet and the entire Kenyan society.' Other Kenyans, like Edwin Mugalo, disagree with Gachagua's impeachment, especially because the deputy president fell ill while the proceedings were happening. 'It wasn't good, especially when you are impeaching someone who's in the hospital. It was so untimely,' Mugalo said. 'You would've given him time or rather they would've sat down together and had a discussion. Everybody makes a mistake. You sit down and agree this is where I've made a mistake and move forward. But impeaching him wasn't the right thing.' Gachagua was Ruto's running mate in the 2022 elections. And for Dominic Orenge, people had voted for a ticket. 'They were actually elected for five years so that we can actually read their leadership for five years so that when 2027 comes, we can actually look at what they've said, what they've done for the country,' Orenge said. Of the 11 charges leveled against Gachagua including accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth and undermining the president, Gachagua was found guilty of five. Francis Khayundi, an assistant professor of international law at USIU-Africa, told VOA the decision to vote out Gachagua was expected. 'It was a bit biased from the get-go, particularly listening to some of the submissions,' Khayundi said. 'From a legal standpoint, looking at the threshold for impeaching a … deputy president in this case seems to have been very low. But at the same time there was an attempt to follow the constitution.' Khayundi said while it looks like a fait accompli, it'll be interesting to see what comes next, especially because the ousted deputy president was admitted to the hospital and the process could've been delayed, allowing him to take the witness stand. 'I can assure you that it's not the end of it,' Khayundi said. 'I think we shall have the courts come into play.

Acik Radyo falls silent as Turkish media regulator revokes license	ISTANBUL — With a farewell song of 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys, a Turkish radio station fell silent this week after nearly 30 years of broadcasts. The final Acik Radyo broadcast on Wednesday came as a court upheld the Turkish media regulator’s order to revoke the Istanbul-based station’s license over the mention of 'Armenian genocide' on air. Following the court ruling on October 8, the Radio and Television Supreme Council, known as RTUK, informed Acik Radyo that it must stop broadcasting within five days. The order to revoke the license silenced the independent radio station for the first time since it began terrestrial broadcasting in 1995. 'We are finishing now; thank you to all Acik Radyo listeners and supporters. Acik Radyo will remain open to all the sounds, colors and vibrations of the universe,' Omer Madra, the editor-in-chief, said on air before the last song played. The license revocation is related to comments made on air by journalist Cengiz Aktar on April 24. Aktar said the day was 'the 109th anniversary, the anniversary of the massacres of Armenians, that is, the deportations and massacres that took place in the Ottoman lands, the massacres that are termed genocide.' 'This year, the commemoration of the Armenian genocide was also banned, you know,' Aktar said. In a statement to VOA’s Turkish Service, the RTUK said 'the terms ‘genocide’ and ‘massacre’ were used for the 1915 Events, and the program moderator made no attempt to correct this.' The term '1915 Events' is how Turkish officials usually refer to the killing of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey denies the deaths constituted genocide, saying that the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest. April 24 is recognized as a commemoration day of the beginning of what many historians and countries, including the United States, Canada and France, recognize as the Armenian genocide. Broadcasts cut Turkey's media regulator first imposed an administrative fine and five-day suspension on Acik Radyo in May over the guest's statements. RTUK said the broadcast violated the law by inciting public hatred and enmity by making distinctions 'based on race, language, religion, gender, class, region and religious order.' On July 3, the regulator moved to revoke the license, saying that Acik Radyo had failed to comply with the suspension. In a statement, the radio station said that it had intended to comply and had paid the first installment of the administrative fine. It added that the failure to implement the suspension was a result of 'technical inconvenience.' An RTUK official told VOA that according to the law, if a media provider continues to broadcast after a suspension 'the Supreme Council shall decide on revoking its broadcasting license.' 'As can be seen, the legislator did not grant the Supreme Board any discretion in this matter and made it mandatory to cancel the license in case the sanction is not applied,' the RTUK official told VOA. Acik Radyo defended the guest's statement as being in 'the scope of freedom of expression.' When Acik Radyo appealed the fine and suspension, a court in July ruled in the station’s favor. But RTUK objected to the court ruling and, on October 8, the court ruled in favor of the regulator. Umit Altas, Acik Radyo's lawyer, called RTUK's move 'excessive intervention.' 'RTUK's decision to revoke the license, which is the most severe penalty, is against all precedents. This has exceeded the proportionality criteria of both Turkey's Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. License cancellation is the most severe decision. We think that it is not lawful to make such a decision,' Altas told VOA Turkish. The station has appealed the most recent court decision, and its lawyer expects a verdict within a month. Acik Radyo's broadcast coordinator, Didem Gencturk, told VOA Turkish that the station is evaluating its options. She said that RTUK also requires internet broadcasters to obtain a license. 'We have the right to apply for different license forms as broadcasters. We hope to continue our broadcasts with one of these, even if not on a terrestrial [land-based] medium,' Gencturk said. Supporters gather On Wednesday evening, Acik Radyo's listeners and supporters gathered in front of the outlet's studios in Istanbul to show their solidarity. Madra read a statement and called the license withdrawal 'an attempt to silence the public voice.' Madra added that the station is evaluating its options for continuing its broadcasts. 'There is no way that Acik Radyo will be silenced or be forgotten after the RTUK's decision. Let me even say that we may be able to take [the license] back,' Madra told VOA Turkish. Some of those who gathered outside the station had contributed to programming over the years. 'We are not giving in to despair. We will bring our broadcasts to our listeners and supporters as soon as possible,' said Yesim Burul, who produces 'Sinefil,' a show on cinema, for Acik Radyo. Murat Meric, who produces several music shows, called for solidarity and said he is preparing to continue his show. Turkish actor Tulin Ozen told VOA Turkish she grew up with the station. 'I think the silencing of Acik Radyo is a shame for Turkey. I am here because I am against censorship in general. I am here because I am against being silenced,' Ozen said. This story originated in VOA’s Turkish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/acik-radyo-falls-silent-as-turkish-media-regulator-revokes-license/7827857.html	2024-10-18T11:18:41-07:00	
Western allies give qualified support to Zelenskyy’s victory plan	A day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented a 'victory plan' to European Union leaders and NATO defense ministers, the nation’s allies are giving it qualified support, with one leader saying it will be reconsidered after the U.S. election next month. Zelenskyy’s plan, which he unveiled to Ukraine’s parliament Wednesday, calls first for an unconditional invitation to join NATO, along with the deployment of a nonnuclear deterrent to Russian aggression, among other points. He maintains the plan could end the war no later than next year. While NATO allies and leadership insist Ukraine’s future is with NATO, a formal invitation to join the alliance has not been made. NATO allies have said the nation cannot become a member while it is at war, and the focus has been on providing Ukraine with the support it needs to win. The NATO-Ukraine Council met late Thursday, following Zelenskyy’s presentation to the defense ministerial meeting. At a Friday news conference in Brussels, new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the focus of that meeting was 'to get massive military aid into Ukraine' from Western allies. 'Obviously, we all know that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, so the question is exactly when and when the invitation will take place,' Rutte said. 'But that was not the main issue of the debate last night.' U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked about Zelenskyy’s plan during a briefing in Brussels Friday. 'The victory plan is President Zelenskyy's plan, and we're going to do everything that we can and provide security assistance to support the president as he tries to accomplish his objectives,' Austin said. Austin added, 'It is not my position to evaluate publicly his plan. We have been supporting him by providing security assistance in a major way for over two and a half years. We are going to continue to do that.' U.S. President Joe Biden was in Berlin Friday for meetings with the leaders of Britain, Germany and France. Support for Ukraine was a focus of their talks. On the sidelines of that meeting, U.S. national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters the White House is still reviewing Zelenskyy’s plan. He said while he did not want to go through every detail, the United States supports 'President Zelenskyy's plan for a just peace. It's critical that whatever that peace looks like, it has to be acceptable to him and to the Ukrainian people.' Ukrainian media reported that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk spoke to reporters Friday following European Union talks in Brussels and said there was 'no consensus' on the plan among EU leaders. He said it was difficult to tell how realistic it is because 'much depends on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.' Tusk added that the plan would be reassessed after the U.S. elections next month. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has indicated he does not support continuing U.S. military aid for Ukraine, at least not at current levels. Also Friday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces Thursday suffered their second deadliest day since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022. On its account on the Facebook social media platform, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces reported 1,530 Russian casualties since Thursday. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/western-allies-give-qualified-support-to-zelenskyy-s-victory-plan/7827779.html	2024-10-18T10:23:12-07:00	
Israel trying to sow divisions in Lebanon to isolate Hezbollah, analyst says	Some observers say Israel is attempting to promote internal divisions in Lebanon as part of its campaign against Hezbollah. But even amid a devastating war, some Lebanese see an opportunity to unify the country.

Indonesian President-elect Prabowo touted as foreign policy president	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Analysts expect a departure in style and substance from Prabowo Subianto, set to be inaugurated Sunday as Indonesia’s eighth president, compared to predecessor Joko Widodo. 'Prabowo will be a foreign policy president and have a hands-on approach in dealing with foreign policy matters,' said Fadli Zon, his longtime political party confidant and the chairperson of the House Committee for Inter-Parliamentary Cooperation. 'Just look at his style of diplomacy. He has personally met global leaders of large countries even before he is inaugurated.' Former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who led Indonesia from 2004 to 2014, has made a similar prediction. 'Pak Probowo, ‘you are on the right track’ and have become ‘foreign policy President,’ he wrote in Indonesian on the social media platform X following Probowo’s remarks at the Shangri-la Dialogue 2024 forum in Singapore earlier this year. 'Good luck and carry on!' Indonesia held the rotating G20 presidency under Widodo and spearheaded diplomatic initiatives for peace in Myanmar as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year. Widodo was also the first state leader to visit Ukraine and Russia after Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor. Widodo nevertheless mostly focused on domestic affairs and has never attended the United Nations General Assembly. Most of Indonesia’s foreign diplomacy was led by Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. Prabowo has visited more than 20 countries in the last six months as defense minister, and he met with state leaders in China, Japan, Australia, France, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. He is the first president-elect to have gone on an overseas tour to strategic global partner countries before assuming office. Associate Professor Teuku Rezasyah from Bandung's Padjajaran University said this indicates he will be active internationally and is interested in building support and trust with global leaders early on. While these meetings highlighted defense issues, the sessions included wider bilateral and geopolitical issues. Prabowo, who lived in several countries in his youth, speaks English, Dutch, German and French. Indonesia as influential middle power Calvin Khoe, lead analyst at FPCI Research & Analysis, wrote in an East-West Center Asia-Pacific Bulletin that 'Indonesia enjoys several comparative advantages that empower it as an activist nation and differentiate it as a middle power.' He added that Prabowo 'will strive to make Indonesia an even more influential middle power.' Khoe pointed out that in a Newsweek interview, Prabowo said Indonesia 'must become more assertive in its foreign policy, bilaterally or multilaterally through its engagement in the U.N., OIC [Organization of Islamic Cooperation], ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] and more responsive to shaping the geopolitical realities of our region.' However, Dinna Prapto Raharja, founder of Jakarta-based Synergy Policies, said she expects Prabowo to show less enthusiasm for ASEAN than Widodo, who had said the Southeast Asian bloc was the cornerstone of his foreign policy. 'So, for somebody who is quick and pragmatic like Prabowo, I think he would not have enough patience to go through the nook and crannies of ASEAN. We’ve seen in the past 10 years how limited ASEAN resources can be to actually make impact at the state level. 'ASEAN at the people-to-people cooperation, I think will remain important. But I think he will want to take shortcuts to ensure timekeeping is more efficient.' Resolving Israeli-Palestinian conflict Prabowo has made the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a signature issue, indicating at the recent International Conference on Gaza in Jordan and the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore that Indonesia will support, contribute and facilitate all efforts toward a two-state solution. These efforts may include the deployment of peacekeeping troops, air assets and a hospital ship, along with medical personnel to run a field hospital in Gaza. Dinna said Probowo’s best prospects for impacting the conflict lie with the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Security Council. 'We've seen how Middle Eastern countries, since the Abrahamic Accord, has been split to different standings,' she said. 'So, if Indonesia wants to be quick, one of the most effective steps it can take is through multilateral forums. Indonesia can also develop caucuses in different agencies to build stronger voices, and also consult the secretary-general, who I'm sure is very much frustrated with the situation.' Balancing global superpowers On other issues, Khoe said Prabowo has appealed to China and the United States to be responsible global powers, arguing that the two global powers can co-exist, cooperate and collaborate. Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Indonesia during the campaign, Prabowo committed himself to the principle of good-neighbor diplomacy, which stresses the importance of building a network of strong friendships with all countries in the region to ensure stability and economic growth. In terms of Indonesia’s relations with China, Dinna said that Indonesia will continue to collaborate with China, Indonesia’s largest trading partner and a major investor in the country. Prabowo is expected to remain cautious, however, regarding China’s aggressive posture in the South China Sea. China's nine-dash line, which it claims to delineate its ancient fishing grounds, overlaps with Indonesia's exclusive economic zone near Indonesia’s Natuna islands. 'I think, first and foremost, he would also make sure that he attends all the meetings and negotiation forums. This time he is not going to just send the foreign minister,' Dinna added. 'I think this is what's going to be different between him and Joko Widodo. He is going to make sure he can talk in person with [Chinese President] Xi as president. He is also a very confident man in approaching other major countries interested in keeping the South China Sea safe.' Although Prabowo has traveled the globe in recent months, he has yet to visit the United States. Observers say he is likely to wait for the U.S. presidential election results before he decides to do so. Reuters reported that 36 state leaders will attend Prabowo’s inauguration. The United States is sending a six-person delegation led by U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and including Admiral Samuel Paparo, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesian-president-elect-prabowo-touted-as-foreign-policy-president-/7827626.html	2024-10-18T09:18:12-07:00	
Rwanda shrugs off 'sportswashing' criticism in pursuit of a winning development formula	NAIROBI, Kenya — He may be the president of a small, landlocked state in central Africa, but Paul Kagame has always had outsize dreams. In recent months, Rwanda's president has embarked on perhaps the biggest of them all by pitching to bring a Formula 1 Grand Prix to a country that was mired in genocide 30 years ago but now sees itself as one of the continent's leaders. Determined to overcome his country's geographical disadvantages, Kagame has relentlessly pursued a political, diplomatic and economic strategy to make Rwanda an African heavyweight. In the past four years, he has sent troops to engage rebels in the Central African Republic and mount counterinsurgency operations in Mozambique. At home he has pursued economic reforms to lure foreign investors, transforming Rwanda into a country with a reputation as one of Africa's least corrupt and most business friendly, despite Kagame's own reputation as a democratic laggard. But when it comes to sport, his aspirations extend well beyond Africa. Since 2018, his government has secured sponsorship deals with some of Europe's biggest soccer clubs, developed a partnership with the NBA and spent hundreds of millions of dollars in developing Rwanda's sports facilities. Next year Rwanda will stage the world championships for bicycle road racing. Kagame himself has built a close working relationship with Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, which has opened an office in Rwanda and held its annual meeting there last year. Now he is taking the biggest step yet in his ambition to transform the country into a global sporting power, with F1 executives confirming that they are in exploratory talks with Kagame's government about a possible Rwandan Grand Prix. Experts say that could require billions of dollars in investment and outlay. Given that Gross Domestic Product stands at just $14.1 billion and that there is at yet no track on which to host a race, the idea of a Rwandan Grand Prix might seem far-fetched. Yet with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton pushing for an African F1 race and given Rwanda's reputation as one of the continent's more reliable and transparent states, it is not impossible either. Stefano Domenicali, F1's chief executive, has described Rwanda's proposal as 'serious,' telling motorsport.com that 'they have presented a good plan.' 'We want to go to Africa, but we need to have the right investment, and the right strategic plan,' he added. The country's motorsports profile may receive a boost when the FIA's governing body hosts its annual general assembly and prize giving in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, in December — the first time the ceremony has been held in Africa. Both the Kagame administration and F1 officials are reluctant to reveal details about what they describe as 'ongoing' discussions, but Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said hosting an F1 race would allow the country to move 'from being a consumer of sport to a participant in the business of sports.' 'Rwanda's interest in Formula 1 aligns with our strategy to leverage sports for transformative impact,' she said. 'We seek every opportunity to drive forward Rwanda's development, including through global sporting partnerships.' Rwanda is not alone in seeking an F1 race, with potential competitors also in Africa. South Africa, which hosted Africa's last Grand Prix in 1993, and Morocco, which staged 13 races between 1925 and 1958, are also reportedly keen to reenter the fray. That Rwanda is bidding at all reveals much about how Kagame views sport as an economic and geopolitical weapon. If Rwanda can navigate the obvious economic risks, its ambitious sporting strategy could yield big dividends, both financially and diplomatically. The Seoul Olympics in 1988 helped South Korea transform its global image as an insulated, war-ravaged backwater to an emerging economy open to the world. Although no other sub-Saharan country has quite such a comprehensive and ambitious strategy, Rwanda is following the example of countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar, which have used sport — including the hosting of Grand Prix races — to boost their reputations abroad. Like them, Rwanda has faced criticism that it is using sport to distract attention from a checkered human rights record. Kagame, who secured 99.2 percent of the vote in July's presidential election, is accused of using increasingly repressive methods to consolidate his 30-year grip on power. Critics of his ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front have experienced intimidation, arrest and even death. Meanwhile, the United Nations has accused Kagame's government of stoking, funding and arming a rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda's troubled neighbor to the east. The United States cut military aid to Rwanda in protest. Accusations of 'sportswashing' Both Rwanda and its international sporting partners have faced accusations that they are using sport to divert attention from Kagame's rights record, a practice known as 'sportswashing.' In August, two U.S. senators, Republican Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Jeff Merkley, wrote to the NBA accusing it of 'putting profit over principle' by forging close ties with the Rwandan government. Some European lawmakers have raised similar objections to question Rwanda's sponsorship of soccer clubs Arsenal, Paris Saint Germain and Bayern Munich, a strategy Kagame's government says will boost tourism. The prospect of a Rwandan F1 race has renewed such criticism. 'The critical question is what kind of due diligence Formula 1 did to ensure it lives up to its own stated human rights commitments and avoid contributing to laundering the Rwandan government's human rights record,' said Clementine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. 'Rwanda's partners should open their eyes and see Kigali's wide-reaching human rights abuse for what it is: the consequence of three decades of impunity for the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front.' Rwanda is far from the only country with a contentious rights record that has used sport to shape a different narrative about itself. Saudi Arabia, stung by scrutiny following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, has invested more than $10 billion in sport, including golf, F1 and soccer. Infantino has steered the men's 2034 World Cup hosting rights toward Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which has close commercial links with Rwanda, spent $230 billion on hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Yet Rwanda is a financial minnow in comparison and depends on donor aid to fund 40% of government expenditure, leading to questions about the wisdom of seeking to emulate Gulf petrostates. 'The Saudis employed this sort of strategy to get people to forget about awkward things like dismembering journalists,' said Michela Wrong, author of Do Not Disturb, a book critical of Kagame. 'But the difference is Saudi Arabia can afford these deals. Rwanda can't. Rwanda is a very poor country, heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture and foreign aid, which is pouring millions of dollars into some of the world's richest clubs. There is something innately distasteful about this.' There is little doubt that Kagame's sports strategy is an economic gamble. Despite his business-friendly policies, Rwanda's market has proved too small to lure significant inward investment, something that hosting big-ticket sporting events could go some way to address, particularly if it gains 'first mover advantage' by getting ahead of other African rivals. On the other hand, even richer states have struggled to make event hosting pay. 'Sporting events are incredibly expensive to stage and the net impact is very often negative rather than positive,' said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy. 'For Rwanda, given its relative economic weakness, this will be a concern.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7827575.html	2024-10-18T08:23:27-07:00	
Britain, China strike conciliatory note during top diplomat's visit	BEIJING/LONDON — China and Britain took steps toward further reconciliation on Friday, with Beijing heralding the new Labour government's plan to develop 'pragmatic' bilateral ties as a 'new starting point.' British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is only the second top U.K. diplomat to visit China in six years, and his trip seeks to demonstrate that Britain is taking a strategic approach to building ties with Beijing, despite areas of sharp disagreement. 'China-Britain relations ... now stand at a new starting point,' Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with his counterpart at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing. 'Competition among major powers should not be the backdrop of this era.' Lammy mentioned openings for 'mutually beneficial cooperation' in areas such as climate, energy, science, trade and tech, while cautioning that Britain would 'always put its national interests and national security first.' Beijing and London should 'show that countries such as ours with different histories and outlooks still find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges,' he said. The Labour government, elected in July, wants to show it is serious about engaging with China, balancing a desire to cooperate on economic and global matters with challenging Beijing on issues like its support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Wang added that Beijing judged Labour's new model for developing relations as 'positive' because it 'conforms to ... the current needs of the bilateral relationship.' Lammy will meet his Chinese counterpart Wang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, who is responsible for science and technology, in Beijing on Friday, before traveling to Shanghai to meet British businesses operating in China on Saturday. Speaking before the visit, Lammy said engagement with China was 'necessary to support U.K. and global interests' and added that he hoped to raise Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the global green transition with his counterpart. Lammy's visit is not expected to yield major diplomatic agreements. Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said the talks would focus on improving cooperation in various fields. Britain's relations with China under the previous government were soured by clashes over human rights, Hong Kong and allegations of Chinese espionage. Earlier this year, Britain said it was extremely concerned after Reuters reported Russia has established a weapons program in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones for use in the war against Ukraine. Britain has made major shifts in its approach toward China in the past decade, moving from saying it wanted to be China's greatest supporter in Europe to being one of its fiercest critics, and now again trying to improve relations under the new Labour government. The Labour administration has commissioned an all-government audit of the U.K.-China relationship and has said it would be 'clear-eyed' when it comes to China, given allegations of Chinese cyberhacking as well as espionage on British soil. Meanwhile China faces worsening relations with the European Union over various trade defense measures, as well as fractious ties with the United States. China is Britain's sixth-largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of total trade, British government figures show.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-china-strike-conciliatory-note-during-top-diplomat-s-visit/7827585.html	2024-10-18T08:20:36-07:00	
Prosecutors in Iran target a newspaper over its cartoon mocking internet restrictions	An Iranian newspaper implying that the public needed to have the patience of the Biblical figure Job in waiting for President Masoud Pezeshkian to lift restrictions on the internet now faces potential criminal charges. The reported case against the pro-reform newspaper Ham Mihan represents one of the first media freedom issues to be faced under Pezeshkian, himself a reformist who has promised to ease a police crackdown on women wearing the hijab and improve relations with the West. The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported Thursday that the charges had been filed by Tehran's prosecutor's office against the newspaper. It remains unclear exactly what fines or punishment the publication could face, though some have been ordered to suspend their publication in the past in disputes with Iran's theocracy. The cartoon published Wednesday showed Job standing in front of the Cabinet spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, asking: 'Excuse me, this filtering is not solved?' Iranians use that term in referring to the internet restrictions, which slow foreign websites and speed those within Iran's so-called 'halal net.' The cartoon showed Mohajerani answering: 'No, be patient a little bit more, it will be solved.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-in-iran-target-a-newspaper-over-its-cartoon-mocking-internet-restrictions/7827593.html	2024-10-18T08:20:36-07:00	
Texas Supreme Court halts execution of man in shaken baby case	HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS — The Texas Supreme Court halted Thursday night's scheduled execution of a man who would have become the first person in the United States put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. The late-night ruling to spare for now the life of Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, capped a flurry of last-ditch legal challenges and weeks of public pressure from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science. In the hours leading up to the ruling, Roberson had been confined to a prison holding cell a few feet from America's busiest death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville, waiting for certainty over whether he would be taken to die by lethal injection. 'He was shocked, to say the least,' said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson Amanda Hernandez, who spoke with Roberson after the court stayed his execution. 'He praised God, and he thanked his supporters. And that's pretty much what he had to say.' She said Roberson would be returned to the Polunsky Unit, about 72 kilometers (45 miles) to the east, where the state's male death row is located. Roberson, 57, was convicted of killing of his daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. A night of last-minute maneuvers It is rare for the Texas Supreme Court — the state's highest civil court — to get involved in a criminal matter. But how the all-Republican court wound up stopping Roberson's execution in the final hours underlined the extraordinary maneuvers used by a bipartisan coalition of state House of Representatives lawmakers who have come to his defense. Rejected by courts and Texas' parole board in their efforts to spare Roberson's life, legislators on Wednesday tried a different route: issuing a subpoena for Roberson to testify before a House committee next week, which would be days after he was scheduled to die. The unusual plan to buy time, some of them conceded, had never been tried before. They argued that executing Roberson before he could offer subpoenaed testimony would violate the Legislature's constitutional authority. Less than two hours before Roberson's execution, a judge in Austin sided with lawmakers and paused the execution, but that was then reversed by an appeals panel. The Texas Supreme Court then weighed in with its order, ending a night of uncertainty. Roberson is scheduled to testify before the committee Monday. 'This is an innocent man. And there's too much shadow of a doubt in this case,' said Democratic state Representative John Bucy. 'I agree this is a unique decision today. We know this is not a done deal. He has a unique experience to tell, and we need to hear that testimony in committee on Monday.' Governor, US Supreme Court did not act Texas Governor Greg Abbott had the authority to delay Roberson's punishment for 30 days. Abbott has halted only one imminent execution in nearly a decade as governor and has not spoken publicly about the case. Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the execution, although Justice Sonia Sotomayor — in a 10-page statement about the case — urged Abbott to grant a 30-day delay. Roberson's lawyers had waited to see if Abbott would grant Roberson the one-time reprieve. It would have been the only action Abbott could take in the case, as the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Wednesday denied Roberson's clemency petition. The board voted unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend that Roberson's death sentence be commuted to life in prison or that his execution be delayed. All board members are appointed by the governor. The parole board has recommended clemency in a death row case only six times since the state resumed executions in 1982. The one time Abbott halted an imminent execution was when he spared the life of Thomas Whitaker in 2018. Texas law on scientific evidence The House committee on Wednesday held an all-day meeting on Roberson's case. In a surprise move at the end of the hearing, the committee issued the subpoena for Roberson to testify next week. During its meeting in Austin, the committee heard testimony about Roberson's case and whether a 2013 law created to allow people in prison to challenge their convictions based on new scientific evidence was ignored in Roberson's case. Anderson County District Attorney Allyson Mitchell, whose office prosecuted Roberson, told the committee a court hearing was held in 2022 in which Roberson's attorneys presented their new evidence to a judge, who rejected their claims. 'Based on the totality of the evidence, a murder took place here. Mr. Roberson took the life of his almost 3-year-old daughter,' Mitchell said. Most of the members of the House committee are part of a bipartisan group of more than 80 state lawmakers, including at least 30 Republicans, who asked the parole board and Abbott to stop the execution. Spotlight on shaken baby syndrome Roberson's case has renewed debate over shaken baby syndrome, known in the medical community as abusive head trauma. His lawyers, as well as the Texas lawmakers, medical experts, bestselling author John Grisham and others, say his conviction was based on faulty and now outdated scientific evidence. The diagnosis refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child's head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor. Roberson's supporters don't deny head and other injuries from child abuse are real. But they say doctors misdiagnosed Curtis' injuries as being related to shaken baby syndrome and that new evidence shows the girl died from complications related to severe pneumonia. Roberson's attorneys say his daughter fell out of bed in Roberson's home after being seriously ill for a week. Roberson's lawyers also suggested his autism, then undiagnosed at the time of his daughter's death, was used against him as authorities became suspicious of him because of his lack of emotion over her death. Autism affects how people communicate and interact with others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/texas-supreme-court-halts-execution-of-man-in-shaken-baby-case/7827543.html	2024-10-18T07:57:15-07:00	
Biden administration races to shell out billions for clean energy as election nears	The Biden administration is shelling out billions of dollars for clean energy and approving major offshore wind projects as officials race to secure major climate initiatives before President Joe Biden's term comes to an end. Biden wants to establish a legacy for climate action that includes locking in a trajectory for reducing the nation's planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Former President Donald Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden's landmark climate and health care bill and stop offshore wind development if he returns to the White House in January. Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee after Biden dropped from the race this summer, has said she will pursue a climate agenda similar to Biden's, focused on reducing emissions, deploying renewables and creating clean energy jobs. Announcements of major environmental grants and project approvals have speeded up in recent months as White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian said Biden is 'sprinting to the finish' and delivering on promises to promote clean energy and slow climate change: The Environmental Protection Agency made $20 billion from a federal 'green bank' available this summer for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the nation's 10th large offshore wind farm, the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, in September, reaching the halfway mark for Biden's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. On Oct. 1, the agency gave a key approval to an offshore wind farm project in New Jersey. In the past month alone, the Energy Department has made six announcements of a billion dollars or more, including more than $3 billion for battery manufacturing projects and a $1.5 billion loan to restart a nuclear plant in Michigan. And just last week, Biden set a 10-year deadline for cities to replace their lead pipes, with $2.6 billion available from the EPA to help communities comply. Besides the climate law, formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden is seeking to spend billions in projects approved under the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021 and the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The $1 trillion infrastructure law includes cash for roads, bridges, ports and more, while the CHIPS law aims to reinvigorate the computer chip sector in the United States through tens of billions of dollars in government support. Energy experts say the rush of announcements is not surprising. 'I'm sure the prospect of a change in the White House, and a change in agency leadership, is creating an increased sense of urgency to get those programs stood up and implemented,'' said Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group research firm. There's an undeniable pressure to lock in as many energy transition benefits as possible before the end of the year, said Matt Lockwood, vice president of strategic market areas and accounts at DNV, which advises companies on energy issues. It's been two years since the climate legislation passed, so federal agencies are starting to churn through these transactions at a faster pace, he said. The climate legislation put the country on a path to cutting greenhouse gas emissions to try to meet targets in the Paris climate accord. The investments are expected to reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% by 2030. A new analysis by global consultant Baringa found that Trump would stall the transition from fossil fuels, though by how much would depend on whether the House or Senate is controlled by Democrats who could temper climate rollbacks. Trump, if unrestrained, could permanently alter the trajectory of the energy transition by repealing the climate legislation, substantially slowing renewable rollout and leaving the U.S. wedded to coal and gas for far longer, said Caspian Conran, an economist at Baringa who co-authored the analysis published Wednesday. As vice president, Harris cast the tiebreaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which was approved with only Democratic support. As a senator from California, she was an early sponsor of the Green New Deal, sweeping proposals meant to swiftly move the United States fully to green energy. At a presidential debate last month, however, Harris boasted that the administration has overseen 'the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over-rely on foreign oil.' Trump's policies, meanwhile, could raise emissions by about 12% by 2030 compared to those favored by Harris or Biden, Baringa's report said, equivalent to roughly 660 million tons of carbon dioxide. 'This is a race against time to certain extent,' Conran said in an interview. 'So even if you're saying we're delaying the transition (to clean energy) by five years, maybe that doesn't seem like a lot. But actually that's quite profound.' The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Baringa says Trump's first-term policies caused emissions to rise 9%, while Biden's policies lowered emissions by 11%. Companies have announced about 340 major clean energy projects across the country in the past two years, according to E2, a nonpartisan environmental research group. Sixty percent of those, representing 82% of the investments and 69% of the jobs, are in Republican congressional districts despite unanimous GOP opposition to the law, E2 said. Eighteen House Republicans, including several in close races for reelection, told the House speaker in August they want to protect energy tax credits in Biden's climate legislation that are creating jobs. 'Energy tax credits have spurred innovation, incentivized investment and created good jobs in many parts of the country – including many districts represented by members of our conference,' the lawmakers wrote. To get the clean energy transition right, the U.S. needs to commit to it across election cycles, from one administration to the next, and through sessions of Congress, said Conrad Schneider, senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, an advocacy group. 'We're trying to publicize the fact that (clean energy) is really beneficial for communities all over the country, whatever political geography,'' he said. 'And so we hope that will mean these programs can be sustained through any combination of electoral outcomes.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-races-to-shell-out-billions-for-clean-energy-as-election-nears/7827546.html	2024-10-18T07:49:06-07:00	
African port growth hindered by poor road, rail networks, report says	NAIROBI, KENYA — Africa has seen the capacity of its ports grow significantly over the years, but a report from the Africa Finance Corporation says the expansions, upgrades and investments have not led to better inland logistics and supply chains. Since 2005, African ports have received an estimated $15 billion in investments, allowing them to accommodate larger ships and offload more cargo for transportation across the continent. According to the African Development Bank, port development has led to increased traffic. Between 2011 and 2021, container units passing through African ports increased by nearly 50%, from 24.5 million to 35.8 million. Gabriel Sounouvou, a Guinean specialist in logistics and supply chain management, said port investments have multiple benefits, including better integration with the global supply chain and a reduction in corruption. 'We cannot modernize the port without technology integration,' Sounouvou said. 'So ... when the government modernizes the port, they also create this transparency that reduces corruption.' However, according to the Africa Finance Corporation's 2024 report, 'State of Africa's Infrastructure,' the increased capacity at ports has yet to lead to an efficient logistical supply chain across the continent. The researchers say African governments have neglected road and railway networks, which are unevenly distributed, of poor quality and underused, which limits their usefulness. Sounouvou said bad roads make it hard to do business in Africa, especially outside coastal areas. 'Many road corridors are not good for trucks,' Sounouvou said, adding that trucks 'can spend more than 10 days instead of three in landlocked countries.' Jonas Aryee, head of Maritime Economics and International Trade Modules at Plymouth University in England, said human factors also make it difficult to transport goods across Africa. 'Some countries are still not opening up, and they're protecting their local industries from those of their fellow African countries,' Aryee said. 'You will find several roadblocks — from police, from customs, from gendarmes — in many countries when goods are going through,' he said. 'And it's made the cost of doing business in Africa so high.' The Africa Finance Corporation study shows the continent has 680,000 kilometers of paved roads, just 10% of the total found in India, which has a similar population but one-tenth the land area. Experts say the roads connecting countries in Africa have remained in bad shape because countries have not formed a joint team to invest in, build and manage highways that could improve the free flow of goods and people. While road networks remain underdeveloped in many African countries, the AFC report said port investments are expected to continue, with several new terminals confirmed for development in countries such as Angola, Benin, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana and Ivory Coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-port-growth-hindered-by-poor-road-rail-networks-report-says/7827490.html	2024-10-18T07:26:22-07:00	
Biden hits Germany with lightning-quick visit focused on Middle East, Ukraine	Berlin — President Joe Biden made a lightning-fast, pomp-filled visit to Germany Friday, making an in-person push for transatlantic unity and scooping up Germany’s highest civilian honor. Biden also met in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom to discuss a range of issues behind closed doors – including how to continue to support Ukraine against Russian aggression, and the rapidly changing situation in the Middle East. The brutal conflict in Gaza injected itself into Friday’s state visit, with news that Israeli forces had killed the leader of the U.S.-designated terror group Hamas that sparked the war with their stunning attack on Israel last Oct. 7. Standing on the tarmac minutes after landing in Germany late Thursday, Biden addressed the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops, calling it a 'good day for the world.' 'Now's the time to move on,' he said. 'Move on, move toward a cease-fire in Gaza, make sure that we move in a direction that we're able to make things better for the whole world. It's time for this war to end and bring these hostages home.' Biden said he would dispatch Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to Israel to discuss plans for the day after. For Germany, this frenzied one-day visit – which included a brief meeting with a 102-year-old Holocaust survivor, Margot Friedlander – was suffused with meaning and history. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who awarded Biden the nation’s highest honor, the Order of Merit, began his reflection of the significance of Biden’s visit with an anecdote from the early 1980s, when a young U.S. senator visited Bonn, then the capital of the divided nation. In true German style, Steinmeier joked, the bureaucrat accompanying the 40-year-old senator made copious notes, saying he was 'keenly interested' in Germany, and concluded that the young senator might have a 'significant political future.' 'What a remarkable understatement,' said Steinmeier before he pinned the 8-pointed golden Star to Biden’s suit lapel. 'Today, you are the 46th President of the United States – and under your leadership, the transatlantic alliance is stronger, and our partnership is closer than ever.' Steinmeier continued, 'Maybe the most precious service to democracy, the most joyful and reassuring thing for people is to know that even this most powerful man in the world is – in the end – a fundamentally decent human being.' VOA asked White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan if part of Biden’s mission in Germany was to shield foreign policy against a possible Donald Trump presidency. 'What the president is trying to do is to make our commitment to Ukraine sustainable and institutionalized for the long term,' Sullivan replied. 'And every other ally agreed that that was the responsible thing to do.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-hits-germany-with-lightning-quick-visit-focused-on-middle-east-ukraine/7827478.html	2024-10-18T07:24:56-07:00	
Concerns over press freedom grow in Chad amid new restrictions ahead of elections	In Chad, the media regulator has suspended a weekly newspaper and two of its journalists for alleged misconduct, and it has urged all other media outlets to comply with new regulations ahead of elections in December.

From the capital, N'Djamena, reporter Andre Kodmadjingar has the story, narrated by Arzouma Kompaore.	https://www.voanews.com/a/concerns-over-press-freedom-grow-in-chad-amid-new-restrictions-ahead-of-elections/7827419.html	2024-10-18T06:22:58-07:00	
Taiwan blames China for South Africa's order to move liaison office	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — South Africa has ordered Taiwan's representative office to relocate outside of the capital, a Taipei Foreign Ministry official said Friday, blaming Chinese pressure for the decision. China considers self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has sought to whittle down the number of countries that recognize its claim to statehood. 'We have been asked to move our representative office out of the capital [Pretoria],' an official from Taiwan's Foreign Ministry told AFP on condition of anonymity. 'Our reasonable conclusion is that it is part of a series of actions by China to suppress Taiwan,' the official said. 'We are still negotiating with South Africa in the hope that there will be room for change.' The official did not say when Pretoria issued the order or when the deadline was for Taiwan to move its office. South Africa's Foreign Ministry defended the decision in a statement, saying it had been 'mischaracterized' and was meant only to reflect Pretoria and Taipei's 'nonpolitical and nondiplomatic' relationship. The Taipei Liaison Office, which is set to be rebranded as a trade office, 'will be appropriately placed in Johannesburg, South Africa's economic hub,' said Chrispin Phiri, South Africa's Foreign Ministry spokesperson. 'This also aligns with standard diplomatic practice that capital cities are the seats of foreign embassies and high commissions,' he said. According to the Foreign Ministry, the South African Liaison Office in Taipei will also rebrand as a trade office. Taiwan's semi-official Central News Agency said Thursday that South Africa issued the order on October 7 and gave the representative office until the end of the month to move. According to Pretoria, Taipei was given six months. China said Friday that South Africa had made the 'right decision.' 'Taiwanese independence advocates do not enjoy popular support and are doomed to failure,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. Taiwan has 12 diplomatic allies, with most nations, including South Africa, instead recognizing Beijing. In 2017, Nigeria ordered Taiwan to shut down its trade office in its capital, Abuja, in what Taipei said was an attempt by Beijing to push it out of the country. Relations between Beijing and Taipei have been fraught for years and have spiked since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te took office in May. Lai is more outspoken than his predecessor in defending Taiwan's sovereignty, with Beijing calling him a 'separatist.' On Monday, China deployed fighter jets, drones and warships to encircle Taiwan in the fourth round of large-scale military drills in just over two years. Taipei condemned Beijing's actions as 'irrational and provocative,' and the island's key backer and biggest arms supplier, the United States, called them 'disproportionate.' Beijing said the drills were a 'stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan Independence' forces.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-blames-china-for-south-africa-s-order-to-move-liaison-office/7827409.html	2024-10-18T06:19:30-07:00	
China's increasing passport controls evoke Mao era	The Chinese government has been acting to restrict travel outside the country by ordering some teachers, civil servants and executives of state-owned enterprises to hand in their passports. Analysts say that under President Xi Jinping, Beijing is reinstating some internal controls not seen since the era of communist China’s founder, Mao Zedong. Hong Jingfu, a professor in the political science department at Taiwan’s National Cheng Kung University, told VOA Mandarin the Chinese Communist Party’s confiscation of the passports aims to prevent foreign infiltration and secrets from being leaked. Hong said the CCP is also worried that as people's confidence in the economy slows, they will become less loyal to Xi's regime and China’s system, and that personnel and capital will flee the country. Hong said Xi is taking China back to the Mao era path of 'internal control and external defense,' of closing the country to the outside world, because the CCP fears sharing the fate of its Soviet counterpart, which collapsed in 1991. 'Under the so-called overall national security concept, his demand for security is constantly rising, which, in fact, is ironically highlighting that China’s so-called ‘four self-confidences’ Xi promotes is [just] more lying and boasting,' Hong said. Former Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2011 announced the so-called 'Three Self-Confidences,' promoting China’s socialist path, theories and system. Xi in 2016 added a fourth one, socialist culture, as a way of cementing his authority and pushing for more communist and nationalist propaganda in education. The Financial Times reported October 6 that since last year, an increasing number of schoolteachers and public sector employees in China have been required to hand in their passports, and those already abroad have been told to avoid contact with 'foreign, hostile forces.' Chinese authorities have always regarded 'instilling loyalty in students' as a top priority. The FT reports the passport controls aim to prevent teachers from being 'ideologically polluted by foreign forces' and spreading ideas that are deemed ill-suited for the country. It's not the first time in modern China that authorities have seized the passports of large categories of key workers. Radio Free Asia reports authorities ordered teachers to hand in their travel documents as early as 2018. A university professor surnamed Li in China’s southeastern, coastal Fujian province, who didn’t want to give his full name due to the sensitivity of the issue, told VOA Mandarin that his university since 2019 has required teachers at the rank of associate professor and above to hand in their travel documents. Even retirees are required to hand in their passports and entry and exit documents, he said, and department heads will only get them back five years after retirement. Li said if a professor wants to travel abroad, they must report to their supervisor the country they are going to, the number of days they will be there, the purpose of the trip and the source of funds before they can get their passport back. Li said the university also requires that passports be turned back in within five working days after returning from abroad. The school did not give them a detailed explanation for the policy, said Li, telling its staff only that it’s to ensure that the teaching, research and management work 'maintains normal order' and is in line with the 'spirit of the relevant documents of the superiors.' Legal authority for Chinese universities to require custody of passports and travel documents appears to be dubious. Article 16 of China’s Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Law on the Administration of the Exit and Entry of Chinese Citizens states that no organ, organization, enterprise, institution or individual other than the public security organ, the original document-issuing authority, the people's procuratorate, or the people's court may revoke or confiscate people’s identification documents. Observers told VOA Mandarin the practice increased significantly after Xi came to power in 2012. The Chinese government last year tightened restrictions on private overseas travel by civil servants and employees of state-owned enterprises, including banning overseas travel, vetting overseas relations, and strengthening approvals and confidentiality training. Li believes his university’s policy was prompted by government fears that teachers may leak sensitive research information or fail to return to China at all. Hong, of National Cheng Kung University, says the control of passports also aims to keep middle-class people from leaving the country in order to restore consumer confidence and consumption levels. China's economic downturn has led to a drop in consumer confidence and spending among the middle class that Beijing has tried to reignite with a series of stimulus measures. But Hong said the CCP’s passport controls are restricting economic activities and discouraging international exchanges that could help grow the economy. 'Actually, you are accelerating your so-called internal disintegration because there is no way to solve your internal contradictions,' he said. Despite the increasing number of passports reported seized, analysts say it’s impossible for China to close off as much as it was under founding leader Mao, when everyone needed permission to travel abroad and being granted a passport was rare. Wang Jian, a commentator living in the U.S. who used to work for the Hong Kong Economic Times, Ming Pao Daily News and Sing Tao Daily News, told VOA Mandarin that since China's reform and opening up after Mao died in 1976, there is no way to close the country as it depends on exporting products and importing raw materials. 'China's current foreign trade model has determined that China's door cannot be closed,' he said. 'Second, the Chinese people [would] not accept it.' During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese authorities implemented strict controls on movement, including travel abroad, and stopped issuing new passports for nearly three years to try to control the spread of the virus. The restrictions led to rare public protests against authorities known as the 'White Paper Movement.'

Eswatini university steps up inclusion efforts with the opening of disability support center	MBABANE, ESWATINI — The University of Eswatini moved early this month to increase access for students with disabilities through the establishment of a Disability Support Resource Centre. With specialized technology to aid students with special needs, the center is aimed at expanding access to education for students with disabilities. Its technology includes printers to convert text to braille, software that converts text to speech, and talking book machines that can read digital or Braille books aloud. Other technology includes voice recognition software to help students with physical disabilities operate computers with voice commands. Senator Stukie Motsa, who has albinism, lauded the center in an interview with VOA. 'This center will help people with disabilities to realize their goals and their dreams in education,' she said. 'And if they are educated, it will open avenues for them to perform in their educational career and compete with others in their professions. It will also open doors to employment, and once they are employed, when they are employed, poverty in Eswatini will be eradicated because they will be able to feed their families and take care of themselves.' Those with disabilities face significant educational barriers in Eswatini, starting in early childhood. School attendance among children with disabilities is much lower than that of those without disabilities. Children with disabilities are often placed in mainstream schools but face a shortage of teachers trained in special education. Sibusiso Khanya, the acting senior inspector for special needs at the Education Ministry, said the ministry is working to address these problems through promotion of inclusion and regular training for teachers, but admitted progress has been slow because of limited resources. 'We still have a challenge with that because we have a long list of learners who need assistive devices and sometimes due to financial constraints, we find it difficult or maybe we can't reach out to all of them,' Khanya said Those with disabilities make up 13% of the Swazi population, and unemployment among this group is 85%, while 51% have no formal qualifications, such as high school diplomas or university degrees. To help resolve the situation, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recently held a National Job and Entrepreneurial Expo for Persons with Disabilities. Fikile Shongwe, the office's disability manager, underscored the importance of the event in promoting diversity in hiring and trade practices. 'We are hopeful that in the near future, an employment equity law will be enacted, requiring every company to maintain a certain percentage of employees with disabilities on their payroll,' Shongwe said. 'Our efforts are not in isolation; we are working in collaboration with the U.N., NGOs, and organizations of persons with disabilities to achieve this goal.' Bongani Makama, the president of the Federation Organization of the Disabled People in Swaziland, acknowledged Eswatini's steps to promote inclusion, but said more must be done. 'We are facing many challenges as persons with disabilities in the country,' Makama said. 'Most of the challenges are communication barriers, more especially for the hard hearing and hard speech impairments. We are also facing challenges of accessibility in the country, which deprives many persons with disabilities, including accessing information and infrastructures that is in the country and also transport. It is a hard thing for persons with disabilities to access.' Despite progress in promoting disability rights, Deputy Prime Minister Thulisile Dladla emphasizes the need for structural changes aimed at a more equitable and inclusive society, saying, 'Our duty is to assist vulnerable groups as part of our commitment to disability mainstreaming and inclusion.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-university-steps-up-inclusion-efforts-with-the-opening-of-disability-support-center-/7827379.html	2024-10-18T05:43:27-07:00	
Israeli officials say Sinwar killing could offer chance for cease-fire	Israeli officials say the country's killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar offers a new chance for a deal that would release Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. The United States, which has designated Hamas a terrorist organization, has already begun a push for a new cease-fire deal. After Israel confirmed the killing of Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded address that evil suffered a heavy blow and Hamas will never control Gaza again. He called on Gaza residents to free themselves from Hamas' tyranny. Israeli analysts said Sinwar's death could lead to new opportunities for the release of the hostages. Netanyahu said anyone who laid down their weapon and returned Israeli hostages would be allowed to leave and live. His words hinted at the possibility that surviving Hamas members would be allowed to leave Gaza and be exiled to a third country. Shira Efron of the Israel Policy Institute said Sinwar's death could spur a major change in Gaza. 'His symbolic death as being the last one of the Hamas leaders, but also the mastermind of the October 7 attack gives Israel the ladder to climb down from the total victory tree and say, OK, we have won the war,' Efron said. 'We can wind down the war in Gaza and move toward a different reality on the ground.' However, it is not clear who will replace Sinwar as the leader of Hamas, and whether he will be able to sign a deal. The most likely candidate seems to be Mohammed Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar's brother, but he does not have the stature within Hamas that his brother did. For the families of the 101 hostages still being held in Gaza, Sinwar's death offers a new opportunity, perhaps the last, to get their relatives home. Israeli officials say they believe about half the hostages are still alive, although some say the number is lower. A deal for a cease-fire in exchange for the hostages has been on the table for months, but both Netanyahu and Sinwar had refused to take it. The wild card for the future is Iran. Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack earlier this month, and Iran has vowed to strike back if Israel does that. A regional war could quickly eclipse any progress in ending the yearlong war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-officials-say-sinwar-killing-could-offer-chance-for-cease-fire/7827367.html	2024-10-18T05:29:07-07:00	
RSF director general calls China's repression of journalists 'totally insane'	Taipei, Taiwan — It has been seven years since the Paris-based press freedom advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) established an Asia-Pacific office in Taipei. The organization’s new Director General Thibaut Bruttin led a delegation to Taiwan this week and met with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on Wednesday. Taiwan ranked first in Asia this year in the 'World Press Freedom Index' released by Reporters Without Borders, and its global ranking rose to 27th, the best result since it was included in the ranking. In an interview with Voice of America on October 14, Bruttin emphasized that Taiwanese media and foreign media in Taiwan face threats from Chinese political propaganda. He said that Taiwan, like many Baltic countries affected by Russian political propaganda, however, has demonstrated resilience and has rich experience in resisting cyber information attacks, which can be used as a reference for the world. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: China remains the biggest jailer of journalists. How concerned are you with China putting more and more reporters behind the bars and what the ripple effect or chilling effect that will have on others, be it reporters, analysts or opinion leaders? Reporters Without Borders Director General Thibaut Bruttin: We're very worried, obviously. We've had very troublesome reports about the situation of Zhang Zhan, for example, who was the laureate of the RSF's [2021 press freedom] awards [in the courage category] and had been just released from jail, now is sent back to jail. We know the lack of treatment if you have a medical condition in the Chinese prisons. Another example is Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong press freedom mogul, he's very likely to die in jail if nothing happens. He's over 70. And there are very little reasons to believe that, despite his dual citizenship, the British government will be able to get him a safe passage to Europe. Second, it's a problem for the general public especially in China, where a lot of people have been deprived of the rights to information worthy of that name. And we're talking about hundreds of millions of people. And it's totally scandalous to see how bad information is treated in the People's Republic of China. It’s even worse of China to export its repression, with international journalists being threatened or arrested. The Communist Party's propaganda is even accessible in newsstands in New York. VOA: Have you observed that China is going after more young people who have a way to speak up through social media? And hushing people up, coercing people to toe the party’s line, even when they are outside China? Bruttin: Yes. For example, we were very shocked in April 2024, when one of our colleagues was briefly detained while covering the Jimmy Lai trial in Hong Kong. They were trying to silence people in mainland China and Hong Kong, and even trying to prevent people from attending the trial. So that nothing is published about it, that you don't have any firsthand account. Most of the journalists in China are afraid of being in touch with us, and their families as well. That's totally insane. It has become the norm in China. So, it's a tricky situation, and we have little reasons to believe that it’s getting any better. We call it 'the great leap backwards' because we really feel that the situation has deteriorated, compared to 15 years ago. During the Hu Jintao years, we felt it was more possible to be a journalist and to investigate. Under President Xi Jinping, there's a crackdown on any voices, even like citizen journalists, who might have a minimal audience or are only partly critical of the government. They can't stand that. VOA: Other than the governments around the world, how can the people outside China help improve human rights in China? Bruttin: What we need is to have a strategic dialogue with some countries who have long-existing economic and political relationships with China in order to improve the situation. For example, I was very shocked when my home country, France, hosted President Xi as a luminary while he was visiting France. I really felt that human rights were put under the red carpet. And that shouldn't be the case. I mean, the fact that you have lots of economic involvement and trade relations [with China] should be an opportunity to discuss human rights in a very transparent way, and hopefully with more impact. And today we don't see that trend in governments, and that's why we think that public pressure could be added. Take Liu Xiaobo for instance, as much as we know that he died of cancer, but bad treatment in prison shouldn’t be ignored. He was a Nobel laureate and very little was done to get him out of jail. The kind of situation that we saw a few years ago could repeat itself. And that's the responsibility of democracies that want to have a role, but they are not performing that role. VOA: Reporters Without Borders established the Asia Bureau here in Taiwan seven years ago. How has your work been developing? Bruttin: We had a long conversation about where to base our office in Asia. Obviously, Hong Kong was a likely choice, but not safe legally, so we're very happy to have made the choice of Taiwan. I think we were among the first international NGOs to have established a presence here. We kind of made a bet that Taipei would be a hub for human rights activists, and we were right. So, we're very happy at what we've been able to achieve. Our activities, including monitoring, training, reporting, advocating, are all anchored here in Taipei. We’ve been successful in attracting the attention of policymakers, donors, the media and human rights activists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rsf-director-general-calls-china-s-repression-of-journalists-totally-insane-/7827303.html	2024-10-18T04:46:20-07:00	
US, allies take lead on North Korea sanctions, with less outside help	The United States and its allies are pressing ahead with efforts to enforce UN sanctions on North Korea, despite what they describe as a lack of cooperation from Russia and China.

Ukraine evacuates thousands from embattled Kharkiv town	Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukraine on Friday said it was evacuating thousands of people from an embattled northeastern town that Kyiv retook from Russia about six months after Moscow launched its invasion in 2022. Kupiansk, a key rail hub in the northeastern Kharkiv region, has suffered deadly shelling attacks in recent months as Moscow's forces get within a few kilometers of the town. The region's governor had warned on Tuesday that authorities were no longer able to guarantee electricity and water to residents due to 'constant shelling' and ordered all civilians in Kupiansk and three nearby communities to leave. 'In total, about 10,000 people need to be evacuated. The pace of evacuation is increasing every day,' Governor Oleg Sinegubov said in a video on his Telegram account published Friday. Kupiansk was seized by Moscow shortly after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and Ukrainian forces retook it around six months later. It was home to just under 30,000 people before the war. Repeated Russian artillery strikes have badly damaged many of its buildings and left dozens of civilians dead. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled an ambitious 'victory plan' this week setting out his vision to end the war with Russia. Russia has been pushing ahead in eastern Ukraine for months, capturing tens of small towns and villages as Kyiv's overstretched troops grapple with exhaustion and manpower shortages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-evacuates-thousands-from-embattled-kharkiv-town/7827200.html	2024-10-18T02:31:42-07:00	
South Korea says North troop dispatch to Russia is 'grave security threat'	seoul, south korea — South Korea said on Friday that it believes North Korea has sent troops to Russia, marking a grave security threat to the international community that Seoul will respond to with all available means, the presidential office said in a statement. Separately, the country's spy agency said North Korea was participating in the war in Ukraine and had decided to send 12,000 troops, including a special forces unit, Yonhap news agency reported. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held an unscheduled security meeting with key intelligence, military and national security officials to discuss North Korean troops' involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine, it said. 'The participants ... shared the view that the current situation where Russia and North Korea's closer ties have gone beyond the movement of military supplies to actual dispatch of troops is a grave security threat not only to our country but to the international community,' it said. South Korean officials have previously said it was likely true that some North Korean personnel were in Russia and involved in its war with Ukraine but have not given a clear answer on the nature or the scale of any such deployment. Yoon's office said South Korea together with its allies have been closely tracking North Korea's troop dispatch to Russia from the initial stages. It did not, however, provide any intelligence to backup the assertion of troop deployment. It also did not specify if it had information on whether North Korean troops were involved in combat. South Korea's National Intelligence Service could not be immediately reached for confirmation of the report on the number of North Korean troops. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused North Korea on Thursday of deploying officers alongside Russia and preparing to send thousands of troops to help Moscow's war effort, although NATO's chief Mark Rutte said there was no evidence of Pyongyang's presence at this stage. Zelenskyy said about 10,000 North Korean soldiers are preparing for deployment to fight Ukraine but Kyiv's Western allies have yet to confirm its assertion that Pyongyang is sending troops, though they say they are studying it. Since their leaders' summit in the Russian far east last year, North Korea and Russia have dramatically upgraded their military ties and they met again in June to sign a comprehensive strategic partnership that includes a mutual defense pact. South Korean and U.S. officials have said North Korea has been supplying ballistic missiles and other munitions to Russia. Since September last year, the North has shipped at least 16,500 containers of weapons to Russia and Russia has fired missiles from those shipments in Ukraine, Washington has said. Russia and North Korea both deny they have engaged in arms transfers. The Kremlin has also dismissed South Korean assertions that North Korea may have sent some military personnel to help Russia against Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-north-troop-dispatch-to-russia-is-grave-security-threat-/7827195.html	2024-10-18T02:22:48-07:00	
Hezbollah vows to escalate war following death of Hamas leader	Jerusalem — Hezbollah vowed Friday to escalate its war with Israel a day after Israeli Defense Forces said they had killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the October 7 Hamas terror attack that sparked the Gaza war. The IDF said Thursday its forces — apparently by chance and without knowledge of Sinwar's location — encountered him and two other militants in a southern Gaza building and opened fire. Israel almost immediately suspected it had killed the 61-year-old Sinwar but only confirmed it after hours of investigation, including checking his DNA and dental records. In a televised statement Friday, the head of Hamas in Gaza, Khalil Hayya, confirmed Sinwar's death, saying Hamas honors 'the memory of the fallen martyr, Yahya Sinwar.' Describing him as 'steadfast, brave and intrepid,' Hayya said Sinwar 'sacrificed his life to the cause of our liberation.' He added that the captives held in Gaza will not be released until the occupation's authorities stop their attacks on Gaza and withdraw their forces from the besieged enclave. Hezbollah, in a statement, while making no mention of Sinwar or his death, announced 'a transition to a new and escalatory phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy, which will be reflected in the developments and events of the coming days.' Speaking Friday in Berlin, U.S. President Joe Biden called the death of Sinwar a 'moment of justice' saying, 'He had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans, and so many others on his hands.' But he said he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to 'also make this moment an opportunity to seek a path to peace, a better future in Gaza without Hamas.' Speaking in Brussels on Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, 'Of course there is' an opportunity with respect to Gaza now that Hamas' Yahya Sinwar is dead. 'We would hope that we can work together to take advantage of that opportunity.' The IDF announced Friday it was calling up an additional reserve brigade for northern Israel. 'Its mobilization will allow the continuation of the fighting effort against the terrorist organization Hezbollah and the achievement of the goals of the war, including the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' The IDF also said Friday its 188th Brigade continues ground activity in southern Lebanon. It reported that troops destroyed dozens of warehouses filled with munitions, several shafts, and enemy infrastructure. The IDF also reported that an airstrike destroyed Hezbollah's regional headquarters 'from which many launches were made toward the northern settlements in recent months.' Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7 terror attack on Israel, and Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,500 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of militants. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States and other Western countries. Nearly three-quarters of Gaza's 2.3 million population is displaced, and nearly the entire population is at risk of famine, according to the United Nations. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-vows-to-escalate-war-following-death-of-hamas-leader/7827187.html	2024-10-18T02:05:43-07:00	
Israel conducts raids on Gaza after killing Hamas chief Sinwar	Jerusalem — Israel conducted raids on Gaza on Friday, pressing its yearlong war to crush Hamas after dealing it a massive blow with the killing of its leader, Yahya Sinwar. Hailing the killing of Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war sparked by Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack was not over but added that it was 'the beginning of the end.' He called the death of Sinwar, mastermind of the deadliest attack in Israeli history, an 'important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas.' Chief of Hamas in Gaza at the time of the attack, Sinwar had become the militant group's overall leader after the killing in July of its political chief, Ismail Haniyeh. U.S. President Joe Biden, whose government is Israel's top arms provider, said: 'This is a good day for Israel, for the United States, and for the world.' 'There is now the opportunity for a 'day after' in Gaza without Hamas in power, and for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.' Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Air strikes Hamas' October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures that includes hostages killed in captivity. Militants also took 251 people hostage during the attack. Ninety-seven remain in Gaza, including 34 who Israeli officials say are dead. The killing of Sinwar did not spell an end to Israel's air strikes on Gaza, with several raids overnight and early Friday pummeling the territory, according to an AFP journalist on the ground. According to Gaza's civil defense agency, rescuers recovered the bodies of three Palestinian children from the rubble of their home in the north of the territory after it was hit at dawn. The Israel military said it was pressing its operation in Jabalia, one of the focuses of the fighting in recent weeks, and where strikes on Thursday killed at least 14 people, according to two hospitals. A U.N.-backed assessment has found some 345,000 Gazans face 'catastrophic' levels of hunger this winter. With the civilian toll in Gaza mounting, Israel has faced criticism over its conduct of the war, including from the United States. Israel's campaign to crush Hamas and bring back the hostages seized by militants has killed 42,438 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures which the U.N. considers reliable. Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi vowed to keep fighting 'until we capture all the terrorists involved in the October 7 massacre and bring all the hostages home.' 'Opportunity' Some Israelis hailed the news of Sinwar's death as a sign of better things to come. 'I am celebrating the death of Sinwar, who has brought us nothing but harm, who has taken people hostage,' said one Israeli woman, Hemda, who only gave her first name. Attending a Tel Aviv rally demanding the hostages' release, 60-year-old Sisil, who also gave only her first name, said his killing presented a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' for 'a hostage deal to end the war.' According to a statement from Netanyahu's office, Biden called him to congratulate him on Sinwar's killing, with the two leaders vowing to seize 'an opportunity to promote the release of the hostages.' Campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government and international mediators to leverage 'this major achievement to secure hostages' return.' Andrew Miller, until recently a senior State Department official dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said Israel was unlikely to agree to a negotiated solution to end the war and free the hostages just yet. 'I'm not especially optimistic that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition will do this. Another Israeli government might, but they just haven't ... demonstrated a real interest in this track,' said Miller, now at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. But he said Sinwar's killing might change 'the public conversation' and deprive Netanyahu of a stated reason for not reaching a deal with Hamas. 'Major achievement' With Hamas already weakened more than a year into the Gaza war, Sinwar's death deals an immense blow to the organization, but whether it will trigger a shift in its own strategy is unclear. It is also unclear whether his successor will be named in Qatar, where Hamas's political leadership has long been based, or in Gaza, which is the focus of the fighting. The Israeli military said Sinwar was killed in a firefight in southern Gaza's Rafah, near the Egyptian border, while being tracked by a drone. It released drone footage of what it said was Sinwar's final moments, with the video showing a wounded militant throwing an object at the drone. Israel is also fighting a war in Lebanon, where Hamas ally Hezbollah opened a front by launching cross-border strikes that forced tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes. Hezbollah said late Thursday it was launching a new phase in its war against Israel, and that it had used precision-guided missiles against troops for the first time. On the same day, Israel conducted strikes on the south Lebanese city of Tyre, where the militant group and its allies hold sway. The Israeli military said five soldiers were killed in combat in southern Lebanon, taking to 19 the number of troop deaths announced since Israel launched incursions into Lebanon last month. In Lebanon, the war since late September has left at least 1,418 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures, though the real toll is likely higher. The war has also drawn in other Iran-aligned armed groups, including in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. Iran on October 1 conducted a missile strike on Israel, for which Israel has vowed to retaliate. Tehran's mission to the United Nations said Thursday that Sinwar's killing would lead to the strengthening of 'resistance' in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7827187.html	2024-10-18T02:05:43-07:00	
Pakistan province shuts schools to contain protests after alleged on-campus rape	LAHORE, Pakistan — Authorities in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province shut all schools and universities for two days on Friday in an attempt to contain the spread of protests by students over an alleged on-campus rape. The closures in Pakistan's most populous province affect an estimated 18 million students. Tensions have been high on college campuses since reports of the alleged rape in the eastern city of Lahore spread on social media, and protests have broken out in four cities. In Gujrat in Punjab province, a security guard died in clashes between student protesters and police on Wednesday. Police arrested a person in connection with the death. The government and police have denied that any rape occurred on a campus of the private Punjab Group of Colleges in Lahore, the capital of Punjab. They are seeking the arrest of nearly three dozen people, including several journalists, saying they spread misinformation on social media that led to the protests. Students, however, announced they would hold a rally later Friday to demand justice for the alleged victim in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The decision to shut all schools in Punjab came a day after hundreds of students ransacked a college building in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Police fired tear gas and charged at the students, arresting more than 250 people. The protests appear to have begun spontaneously, as student unions have been banned in Pakistan since 1984. There are no organizations representing students, although political parties' youth wings exist. Separately, the political party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan announced it will hold protests across the country Friday to oppose any amendments to the country's Constitution. Khan's supporters say Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after his ouster in 2022 in a no-confidence vote in parliament, wants to appoint judges of his own choosing and set up a new constitutional court in parallel with the Supreme Court. The government denies the allegations. Sexual violence against women is common in Pakistan but is underreported because of stigma in the conservative country. Protests about the issue have been rare.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-province-shuts-schools-to-contain-protests-after-alleged-on-campus-rape/7827180.html	2024-10-18T01:44:42-07:00	
Russia tests readiness of nuclear missile unit	MOSCOW — Russia is testing the combat readiness of a unit equipped with Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles in a region northwest of Moscow, news agencies quoted the defense ministry as saying Friday. The Yars, which can be deployed in silos or mounted on mobile launchers, has a range of up to 11,000 kilometers and is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads. Russia has carried out a series of nuclear drills this year in what security analysts say are signals intended to deter the West from intervening more deeply in the war in Ukraine. The latest one is taking place in the same week that NATO conducted its annual nuclear exercise and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy unveiled his 'victory plan.' Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Moscow had extended the list of scenarios that could prompt it to use nuclear weapons, effectively lowering the threshold for their use. Ukraine accused Moscow of nuclear blackmail. In the latest test, a unit in the Tver region will practice moving Yars missiles in the field over distances of up to 100 kilometers under camouflage and protecting them against air attack and enemy sabotage groups, Interfax quoted the defense ministry as saying. Russia previously conducted two rounds of exercises involving Yars missile units in July. It has also held three sets of drills this year to test preparations for the launch of tactical nuclear missiles, which have a shorter range and lower yield than intercontinental strategic rockets. In the course of the war, Putin has issued frequent reminders that Russia has the world's biggest nuclear arsenal, but he has insisted that it does not need to resort to nuclear weapons in order to achieve victory in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-tests-readiness-of-nuclear-missile-unit/7827176.html	2024-10-18T01:35:52-07:00	
Who is Prabowo Subianto, incoming president of Indonesia?	JAKARTA, indonesia — The first time Prabowo Subianto lost a presidential bid, he claimed there had been 'massive' fraud. The second time, the former special forces commander initially said he did not accept the election results but later joined the winner's Cabinet. Prabowo dominated this year’s presidential election, his third attempt in a decade, and is set on Sunday to become the leader of Indonesia on the back of support from outgoing President Joko Widodo and popular policies like free meals for schoolchildren. The 73-year-old, who celebrated his birthday Thursday, has undergone a remarkable transformation: projecting a persona of a charismatic statesman during the campaign -- associated with viral dance moves, represented by a cute and cuddly cartoon avatar and often posing with his cat, Bobby. His new image contrasts with his past reputation as a fiery, pious nationalist who as a military commander faced unproven allegations of rights abuses, and who for a time went into self-exile in Jordan after authoritarian leader Suharto, his former father-in-law, was ousted in a popular uprising in 1998. Since winning the February election, Prabowo has signaled he will seek a greater role for Indonesia on the international stage, pledged to lift economic growth and urged unity in the country. 'I will prove that I will fight for all Indonesians, including those who did not vote for me,' Prabowo said soon after being declared the winner. Prabowo's personality as a self-assured leader is set to reflect in the way he runs the country, likely taking a top-down approach and surrounding himself with a close group of advisers, analysts and sources say. But his past has also raised concerns about the trajectory of democracy, human rights advocates say, in a country that only 26 years ago broke free of authoritarian rule. Officials with Prabowo's Gerindra party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Muhammad Sarmuji, a top official with the Golkar party that is in Prabowo's coalition, said the incoming leader's education in Western countries meant he would not always be a top-down leader and he had also absorbed the value of democracy. Prabowo studied at the American School in London and attended military courses in the United States, including at Fort Benning. 'I am not worried that he will do anything that is anti-democratic. So, there's nothing to worry about,' Sarmuji said. Past a harbinger for future? Prabowo comes from an elite political family. His father was one of Indonesia's most prominent economists, serving in the Cabinets of both presidents Sukarno and Suharto. In 1983, Prabowo married Suharto's daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, but they separated soon after the president was ousted in 1998. They have one son. Prabowo, who was a three-star lieutenant general before being dismissed from the military also in 1998, has been accused of involvement in the kidnapping of student activists and rights abuses in Papua and East Timor. This year, Jokowi, as the outgoing president is popularly known, gave him the honorary rank of four-star general. There was previously a de facto ban on Prabowo's entry to the United States, but the allegations against him are unproven and Prabowo has always denied any responsibility. It's those allegations and some recent comments that have increased fears among human rights activists, who say that Prabowo is inheriting a fragile democracy. President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, said that in 1998 Prabowo showed up at the presidential palace after his inauguration, armed and with a squad of special forces soldiers, and tried to stage a coup. Prabowo has dismissed the accusation. In March, Prabowo described democracy as tiring, costly and messy, and said there was room for improvement. Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia, said that unlike Jokowi, Prabowo could be more overt in any challenges to civil society. 'Prabowo will be more explicit in expressing his views. He will do whatever he says,' Hamid said. Approach to the presidency Prabowo surrounds himself with close family members and former colleagues, including from his time in the military, analysts say. His approach to leadership, sometimes freewheeling comments and who he includes in his inner circle will be closely watched. A Western government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there were questions about how he would work with bureaucrats compared to his closest advisers. While Jokowi often sought advice from his close aides and gave them key positions, he left some issues like foreign policy largely in the hands of bureaucrats. Western officials say they have felt they had a better handle on how Jokowi's government functioned and are still working to understand how Prabowo will operate. Foreign investors have been worried that Prabowo may ease fiscal discipline in the country to try to reach his goal of boosting Indonesia's economic growth to 8%. Prabowo, who was defense minister under Jokowi, raised eyebrows at the regional security forum, the Shangri-La Dialogue, in June by talking about Indonesian peacekeepers going into Gaza and last year proposing a U.N. referendum on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including a demilitarized zone. While experts say public comments like those are unlikely to stop any time soon, they hope Prabowo's actions may be more restrained when he is in office. Yoes Kenawas, a research fellow from Atma Jaya University, said it was unlikely Prabowo would be an authoritarian figure, because of international and domestic resistance. 'Prabowo will be more actively voicing his thoughts to (the) public, from here we could get the sense of a strongman,' Yoes said. 'But whether he will kidnap his opposition? I don't think so, hopefully not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-prabowo-subianto-incoming-president-of-indonesia-/7827164.html	2024-10-18T00:45:38-07:00	
What policies to expect from Indonesia's new president	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Retired General Prabowo Subianto will be sworn in Sunday as the president of Indonesia, the world's third-biggest democracy with the largest economy in Southeast Asia. The following is a summary of Prabowo's policy pledges: Boosting growth Prabowo has set a target to accelerate economic growth to 8%, from 5% now, by developing industries that process Indonesia's rich natural resources and relying on the economic impact of his flagship programs, such as giving students free school meals. Prabowo will be open to foreign investment, his aide has said, such as by offering investors management of airports and seaports. Prabowo, currently defense minister, also plans to raise funds by selling carbon credits overseas to fund green projects that will create jobs, an adviser told Reuters. Energy and food security Central in Prabowo's campaign pledge was to make Indonesia self-sufficient in production of staples, as well as to cut the country's reliance of fuel imports. In his current role as defense minister, he oversaw the 'Food Estate' project, clearing swamps to make way for cassava planting. This project will be expanded, creating 3 million hectares to cultivate rice, corn and soybeans. That is roughly the size of Belgium. Some of the agriculture products will be made into bioethanol. Prabowo has also made preparations to increase the mandatory blending of palm oil-based biodiesel to 50% by next year, up from currently 35%, to reduce gasoil imports. Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil. Free, nutritious school meals Prabowo's most well-known campaign promise is the $28 billion 'Free Nutritious Meals' program providing food for 83 million children and pregnant women to fight stunted child growth. Considered by some economists as costly, the program has sparked concerns from rating agencies and investors that the new government would move away from the prudent fiscal management seen under his predecessor. Prabowo and his aides have pledged to manage the government's budget responsibly, defending the program as necessary for long-term human development. The program would be rolled out in stages starting from January 2025. Tax policy Prabowo has set a target to increase government revenue-to-GDP ratio to 23% from about 12%, promising to do so using improved technology and without raising tax rates. During campaigning, he said he was considering setting up a new tax collection agency modeled on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, but it was unclear if this would be pursued. The former special forces commander would review the possibility of lowering corporate income tax to 20% from 22%, according to media reports citing his adviser, though this would depend on its impact on revenues. It also remains to be seen whether Prabowo would raise the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 12% from 11% on January 1, 2025, an unpopular plan that has been set in motion by the current administration. Future of new capital city Outgoing leader Widodo has made the $32 billion project to move Indonesia's capital 1,200 kilometers away from sinking Jakarta to Nusantara, on Borneo island, his main legacy project. Prabowo has publicly said he would continue building the city, even as he acknowledged the project might take years to complete. However, members of Prabowo's coalition have privately raised doubts about the capacity of the state budget to fund both the new capital and the nutrition program, sources told Reuters. Foreign policy Prabowo has said his presidency will continue Jakarta's long-held foreign policy of non-alignment, promising to maintain good ties with world powers without choosing sides. In a sign he will be more active on the global stage, Prabowo has traveled extensively since winning the election, meeting leaders from countries like Australia, China, France, Japan, Russia and neighboring nations in Southeast Asia. Last year, at a gathering of security officials from many countries, Prabowo as Indonesia's defense minister proposed a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. Months later, he took swipe at the European Union's deforestation rules, saying Europeans forced Indonesians to cut down forests when Indonesia was a Dutch colony, in a seminar explaining his foreign policy stance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-policies-to-expect-from-indonesia-s-new-president/7827157.html	2024-10-18T00:45:01-07:00	
Ban on reporting about president’s health puts Cameroonian journalists on edge	Cameroonian journalists say they are grappling with a new government directive prohibiting public discourse or media coverage of President Paul Biya’s health. The ban, issued by Territorial Administration Minister Paul Atanga Nji on October 9, follows media speculation about the 91-year-old president’s absence from public view. The directive has sparked debate within Cameroon’s media, which faces a critical choice of whether to adhere to the ban and avoid retaliation or continue reporting on matters of public concern. VOA’s Cameroon reporter Moki Edwin Kindzeka said that responses among journalists varied. 'Some have ignored the ban and continued reporting on President Paul Biya’s long absence, [and] ill health,' he said. 'Others are scared, some have been silent on the issue,' he added, pointing out that authorities are closely monitoring media coverage and increasing the pressure on journalists who must navigate a restrictive landscape. Another freelance reporter for VOA’s French to Africa Service, journalist Emmanuel Jules Ntap, said media organizations are being cautious. 'Journalists are scared, and media organizations are being careful. No one is talking about the health of the president,' he said, capturing what some media advocates are characterizing as self-censorship. 'The press is speaking about his long absence from the country but not his health,' he added. The ban has drawn strong reactions from international press freedom organizations. Reporters Without Borders condemned it as an 'act of intimidation and censorship.' The Committee to Protect Journalists echoed these concerns. 'Using national security as the reason to censor is a favorite government tool. If you look at the amount of coverage that the latest ban on reporting about Biya’s health has received, it’s by far the international media and journalists outside the country who are reporting on it,' Africa Program Coordinator Angela Quintal told VOA, adding that the restriction is part of a broader trend in Cameroon. The directive adds to an ongoing pattern of press suppression, Quintal said. She added that local journalists face pressure to self-censor, which is a common issue in Cameroon, especially ahead of next year’s elections. Cameroon’s history of media repression is well-documented. Over the years, journalists have faced threats, imprisonment, and even death for covering politically sensitive topics such as corruption or conflict. There are at least five journalists currently imprisoned on charges linked to their reporting, including those who have covered the country’s conflict in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions, according to CPJ. These journalists are often detained under anti-state charges and, in some cases, tried in military courts. One such journalist who knows too well what Cameroonian prison is like and is now exiled in Europe is Cameroonian journalist Mimi Mefo Newuh, founder of the independent news outlet Mimi Mefo Info. 'By linking this ban to national security simply means that violators, anyone who dares talks about the health of the president of the Republic will be charged,' she said. 'Using the 2014 anti-terrorism legislation in Cameroon and you know what has happened to even journalists like myself.' VOA reached out to the National Communication Council and the prime minister’s office for comment and email inquiries went unanswered. The risks associated with reporting on controversial topics have driven many Cameroonian journalists to self-censor. In 2018, Samuel Wazizi, a journalist who covered the Anglophone crisis, died in government custody, allegedly due to torture. The 2023 murder of Martinez Zogo, known for exposing corruption, further highlighted the dangers faced by journalists. Angela Quintal pointed out that international journalists have been covering the ban more extensively than local media, underscoring the limitations imposed on Cameroonian reporters. 'By issuing the ban, the government only fueled the speculation and made it a story of international interest,' she said. 'The Cameroonian state media are silent, while a few private media outlets, journalists, have been brave enough to ask the question that is every Cameroonian's right to know, where is the president and what are the circumstances of his health?' Mefo said that the situation reflects a recurring theme in Cameroon. 'This is not the first time it’s happened in Cameroon,' she said. 'The reason why this one is peculiar and why it's also making news is the fact that it’s not just about the health of the president, it is also about his whereabout where he is, and whether he’s actually fit to continue being president of the country.' Mefo highlighted the challenges faced by journalists covering Biya’s health amid the ban. 'The media, including social media platforms, were stopped from reporting about the health of the president. Even ordinary Cameroonians were warned against doing that,' she said. Many programs that would typically discuss this topic have shifted to other subjects, and citizens are cautious about posting anything online for fear of reprisal. 'Most of their programs were talking about something else, whereas the main topic at the moment is about President Paul Biya,' she said. The ban on covering Biya’s health is only one aspect of a wider crackdown on press freedom in Cameroon. The government has used laws against criminal defamation, false news, and anti-state charges to silence dissenting voices. In recent years, journalists have been jailed, attacked, and forced into exile. The National Communication Council, the country’s media regulatory body, frequently imposes restrictions and penalties on news outlets that criticize the government or address sensitive issues. 'Cameroon is among the worst jailers of journalists in sub-Saharan Africa,' Quintal said. She added that reporting on issues such as the Boko Haram insurgency, the Anglophone crisis, and corruption is especially dangerous for journalists. Despite these challenges, advocates say journalists continue to find ways to report on pressing issues. Mefo described how her team has adopted security measures to protect reporters covering the president’s health. 'We had to engage in additional security measures after the ban, like changing the names completely, because usually my reporters use pseudonyms to write,' she said.

American reportedly kidnapped from a southern Philippine town	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine police said Friday it has launched a search after gunmen reportedly abducted an American national, who was shot in the leg as he tried to resist before being spirited away from a southern Philippine coastal town by speedboat. Police in Sibuco town in the southern province of Zamboanga del Norte tried to pursue the suspected abductors and their victim, who they identified as Elliot Onil Eastman, 26, from Vermont, after the reported abduction on Thursday night. 'We confirm that there was a report of the alleged abduction of an American national,' the regional police said in a statement. 'We want to assure the public, particularly the community of Sibuco, that we are doing everything in our power to secure the safe recovery of the victim.' The police asked the public to immediately provide any information that could help an ongoing investigation of the reported abduction. Two police reports seen by The Associated Press said that a resident of Sibuco, Abdulmali Hamsiran Jala, reported to police that four men in black clothing who were armed with M16 rifles and introduced themselves as police officers forcibly took Eastman, who tried to escape. One of the gunmen shot Eastman in the leg before dragging him into a speedboat then fled by sea further south toward the provinces of Basilan or Sulu, the police reports said. Policemen chased but failed to find the gunmen and Eastman and alerted other police and Philippine marine units in the region, according to the reports. Philippine authorities did not immediately provide background details of Eastman, but a person with a similar name has posted pictures and videos of himself on Facebook saying he had married a Muslim woman in Sibuco. The U.S. Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to questions about the reported abduction. Muslim armed bands led by the notoriously violent Abu Sayyaf carried out frequent kidnappings for ransom more than two decades ago in the south, home of a Muslim minority in the largely Roman Catholic nation. They targeted American and other Western tourists and religious missionaries, most of whom were ransomed off. A few were killed, including an American who was beheaded on the island province of Basilan and another who was killed while army forces were trying to rescue him and his wife. Relentless military and police offensives, however, have considerably weakened the Abu Sayyaf, which is considered as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the Philippines and similar armed groups and kidnappings for ransom eventually waned. The Philippines is to hold mid-term elections next year for more than 18,000 local and national posts. In the traditionally volatile south, crimes including kidnappings have traditionally spiked as rogue politicians try to raise funds to fuel their campaigns, according to authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-reportedly-kidnapped-from-a-southern-philippine-town/7827118.html	2024-10-17T21:27:56-07:00	
New body to monitor North Korea sanctions enforcement faces doubts about legitimacy	Washington — A question of legitimacy surrounds a new body created to monitor the enforcement of sanctions on North Korea in the absence of a U.N. experts panel with authority to track Pyongyang's expanding illegal military transfers to Moscow. The United States, South Korea and Japan announced the formation of a Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) on North Korea as an alternative to the dissolved U.N. panel of experts that had monitored sanctions enforcement until April. The announcement was made at a news conference Wednesday in Seoul, while U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell was in the country to meet his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. 'The goal of the new mechanism is to assist the full implementation of U.N. sanctions on the DPRK by publishing information based on rigorous inquiry into sanctions violations and evasion attempts,' said a joint statement released by 11 nations, including the U.S., South Korea and Japan. The other eight countries are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's formal name. Diminished legitimacy Members of the former U.N. panel of experts said the new mechanism could function effectively but might be hurt by the lack of a United Nations mandate. 'This new organization will ultimately suffer from legitimacy problems,' although it is an important step in reestablishing reliable reporting around North Korea's sanctions evasion activities, said Aaron Arnold, who served on the U.N. panel of experts from 2019 to 2021. 'Because it is not operating under a [U.N. Security Council] resolution mandate, it will lack credibility in the eyes of many states. Unfortunately, it's more likely that it will be those states that are most at risk for being exposed to North Korea's sanctions evasion and proliferation-related activities,' said Arnold, currently a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. China and Russia, two of the five veto-wielding Security Council permanent members, will not participate in the newly formed team. It was Russia's veto that blocked an extension of the U.N. monitoring regime that had been created in 2009. Since then, the eight-member panel had produced biannual reports on North Korea's violations of sanctions, which had been imposed by the Security Council in a bid to curb the country's nuclear and missile programs. Alastair Morgan, a former expert on the U.N. panel and the British ambassador to North Korea from 2015 to 2018, said the newly formed team should be effective in producing reports like the ones issued by the former panel. The existing sanctions on North Korea also remain in force, he said. But because the new team will operate outside the U.N., any findings or recommendations 'will not be implemented' by the Security Council. Morgan added that since the council 'had not acted on any panel recommendations for designations since 2018, that may not make a substantive difference.' The launch of the MSMT comes as North Korea is ratcheting up its military support to aid Russia in its war against Ukraine. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, in a separate joint statement on Wednesday, expressed 'grave concern over deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including arms transfers' in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged at a press conference in Brussels on Thursday that North Korea was training 'about 10,000 soldiers' to join Russia in its war on Ukraine. Second-best solution George Lopez, who served on the U.N. panel of experts from 2010 to 2011 and again from 2022 to 2023, said, 'Russia and China will claim this new team is illegitimate' because they have increasingly 'decided recently that these sanctions were unfair and illegitimate.' He said the new team is 'a second-best solution' because the Security Council failed to create an alternative within the U.N. framework. The new team can earn legitimacy by 'generating high-quality and transparent reports,' which the 11 countries are capable of producing, Lopez said. Li Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Wednesday that sanctions will not deter North Korea from disengaging in provocative actions. 'Facts have repeatedly proved that resorting to sanctions and pressure will not resolve the peninsula issue but will only further escalate tensions and not be consistent with the interests of any party,' he said. In July, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, the European Union and three other countries sent a letter to China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun accusing Beijing of helping North Korea evade sanctions. China responded that it strictly implements U.N. sanctions. Katsuhisa Furukawa, who served as a U.N. panel expert from 2011 to 2016, said the MSMT should have significant ability to enforce sanctions in addition to its monitoring function. 'Although this new multilateral mechanism will not have legally binding power over all U.N. Member States, it will still be able to have considerable law enforcement power across the globe so long as the U.S., Europe, Japan, ROK, Australia, and possibly Singapore, join,' Furukawa said. 'Even if the non-member governments do not cooperate with the new multilateral organization, the financial institutions in these countries will not be able to ignore the requests from this new multilateral organization because, otherwise, these financial institutions could be sanctioned by the U.S., EU, Japan, etc.,' he continued. It is important to remember that the U.N. resolutions that give member states the authority to act 'are still in effect, and Russia and China can't repeal them,' said Joshua Stanton, a Washington-based lawyer who helped draft the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act of 2016.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-body-to-monitor-north-korea-sanctions-enforcement-faces-doubts-about-legitimacy/7827082.html	2024-10-17T19:23:49-07:00	
Oil production rises as Nigeria intensifies clampdown on theft	Abuja, nigeria — Nigeria is ramping up efforts to curb crude oil theft, citing notable progress in key oil-producing areas. Officials say Operation Delta Safe has shut down illegal refineries, recovered millions of liters of stolen oil and made several arrests. They say the operation has raised crude output by 16.7% in the past year. Delta Safe land and air commanders Jamal Abdussalam and Ali Idris recount gains. 'Once they see soldiers, they take to their hills,' Abdussalam said of the thieves. 'As long as the soldiers will see them, and they see the soldiers, they will be arrested, and all the materials they are using will also be carted away and will be destroyed.' Idris said that 'we are also partnering closely now with some of the IOCs — the international oil companies,' which have given Nigerian officials information on illegal pipeline connections. The cooperation has been very successful, 'and the results are beginning to show.' Security forces are using air and land operations to monitor and protect the oil-rich region. New helicopters and aircraft have improved surveillance and combat operations. Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, said those resources have helped the mission advance. 'We are leveraging a lot on technology,' he said. In addition to maritime surveillance systems, 'we have drones that fly apart from the patrols that go on water. And then we have the helicopters that also fly to see issues and then be able to take down all illegal refineries. I think that's our target. All illegal refineries must go.' Oil theft costs Nigeria many millions of dollars yearly; $23 million was lost daily in 2022, and $1.43 billion was lost in March 2023 alone, according to Senate estimates. Operation Delta Safe aims to reduce the losses, with a production goal this year of 1.7 million barrels per day. Emeka Onumajuru, Delta Safe's defense training and operations chief, projected continued improvement, saying that 'most of the pipelines are secure. Oil being piped is no longer siphoned at the same level it was before.' While progress has been made, Onumajuru confirmed that rough terrain and weak community engagement remain obstacles. 'Naturally, the Niger Delta is a very difficult terrain to operate, and swampy, densely forested. ... Secondly, to the level of community relations: If the level of community engagement is high among the communities, among the international oil companies ... the tendency to have frequent disagreements will not be there.' Defense chief Musa reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to working with local communities. 'We're going to work with them to ensure that whatever is due for them, they get, because we know when they're happy, everywhere will be good,' he said. Although the crackdown is being hailed as a significant achievement, experts caution that lasting success will hinge on effective cooperation among security forces, government bodies and local stakeholders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oil-production-rises-as-nigeria-intensifies-clampdown-on-theft-/7827079.html	2024-10-17T19:12:19-07:00	
Death of Hamas leader brings hope, peril	Washington — The killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar after what appears to have been a chance encounter with Israeli forces has sparked renewed hope in Washington that the conflict that has ravaged Gaza and set the Middle East on the brink of a regional war could give way to a potentially peaceful resolution. In the hours following Israeli confirmation of Sinwar's death Thursday, in fighting that took place a day earlier, top U.S. officials praised the development as a significant counterterrorism achievement. 'This is a good day for the world,' President Joe Biden told reporters, shortly after arriving in Berlin for meetings. But the U.S. president also said it was time to 'move on,' for Israel to end the war, and for the hostages to come home. In a separate statement, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Sinwar, the architect of the October 7, 2023, terror attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis, 'vicious and unrepentant.' He said, 'The world is a better place with him gone.' Yet Blinken also promised that the United States 'will redouble its efforts with partners to end this conflict, secure the release all hostages, and chart a new path forward' for the people in Gaza. Charting that new path, however, promises to be challenging. 'In the short term, this will create, I believe, a degree of chaos on the ground,' said Ghaith Al-Omari, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority. 'Sinwar was a unique leader,' Al-Omari said. 'Hamas doesn't have anyone who can fill that particular role.' Al-Omari and other former officials say the list of possible replacements is short. One possibility is Sinwar's brother Mohammed, though some experts think he is too weak to be able to grab control of the entire terror organization. A more likely candidate, they say, is Khaled Mashaal, a high-ranking and well-known Hamas official in Doha, Qatar. Another possibility, though less likely, is Khalil al-Hayya, who has served as a Hamas negotiator. Both might be open to ending the war. 'They are more keen on, let's just say, cashing in and getting what they can and reaching a deal and trying to get some benefits from it,' Al-Omari said, noting there is a catch. 'Their ability to actually produce change on the ground [in Gaza] is limited.' Still, their potential willingness to deal is a marked departure from Hamas' stance under Sinwar. 'He [Sinwar] was blocking all paths to any agreement,' a former Israeli security official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the developments. U.S. officials have expressed similar sentiments. But many have also expressed repeated concerns about Israel's readiness to come forward with plan for the 'day after' fighting in Gaza ends. 'We're continuing to talk with our Israeli counterparts in terms of what that would look like,' Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Thursday. 'Certainly, it will be a complex undertaking.' One concern is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may want to continue to press his military advantages against Hamas in Gaza as well as against the Hezbollah terror group, to the north, in Lebanon. 'The way the Israelis have been on the offensive in both Gaza and Lebanon, I don't think Netanyahu is going to stop anytime soon,' Colin Clarke, director of research at the global intelligence firm The Soufan Group, told VOA. 'I expect it [Sinwar's death] to be important in degrading Hamas, but I doubt it will impact conflict resolution at this stage,' he added. Others are more hopeful. 'Now Israel has what they always needed,' former U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross said. 'What they always needed, at least at one level, was going to be some manifestation of having won. And it's not just the destruction of the of the military, of Hamas or the military infrastructure. It was also that you had to get the guy who was responsible for doing it in the first place.' But even Ross, like Al-Omari now a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, worries a cease-fire deal that sees the return of the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, could be derailed by the lack of a 'day after' plan and the absence of any credible authority on the ground. 'Frankly, the only option here is the Palestinian Authority,' Ross said, referring to the Palestinian body that governs in the West Bank. 'There won't be another answer,' he said in response to a question from VOA, warning the alternative is 'a vacuum that will be filled by the worst forces, including Hamas, being able to make a comeback.' For some current and former Western officials, such a scenario remains a distinct possibility. Sinwar's death is a 'a major blow' to Hamas, said Edmund Fitton-Brown, a former senior United Nations counterterrorism official who currently serves as a senior adviser for the Counter Extremism Project. Only it is not a certain death blow for the Gaza-based terror group. 'It may be that Hamas' status as top dog is less clear. But no other group is in a position to seize that position,' Fitton-Brown said. 'It might lead to fragmentation of Palestinian extremists with unpredictable results.' That could include ongoing fighting in Gaza. 'I would expect a low-level insurgency to continue,' said Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president for research and Middle East scholar at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'There will likely be pockets of resistance by Hamas or perhaps Hamas-aligned fighters,' Schanzer told VOA. 'There is probably still a somewhat large supply of young men in tracksuits willing to pick up AK-47s and fight either in the name of Hamas or in the name of something that is perhaps aligned with Hamas notionally.' Just how many is a concern for Israeli and U.S. officials. 'Hamas has been incredibly degraded,' the Pentagon's Ryder said Thursday. '[They] certainly do not resemble anything close to what they were on October 7.' Some analysts estimate that of the 24 battalions Hamas commanded when it launched its terror attack on Israel last year, 23 have been destroyed. And Israeli officials claim to have killed about 17,000 Hamas fighters since launching their operation into Gaza. But declassified U.S. intelligence estimates, from just last month, put the number of Hamas fighters at 'probably ... fewer than 20,000 fighters,' down from 20,000 to 25,000 a year earlier. In addition to Hamas, U.S. intelligence in the past raised concerns about a dozen other militant groups in Gaza, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which at times have worked to bolster Hamas' efforts. There are also questions about how Iran may react now that it has seen Israel degrade two of its more prominent regional proxies in Hamas and Hezbollah. Earlier this month, Tehran launched approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israeli operations that killed other Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. Israel's prime minister promptly warned Iran that it 'will pay' for the attack, and Iranian officials have been bracing for Israel's response ever since. 'All eyes will be on Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader,' said Schanzer. 'He'll be in a position where he has to respond. Is it just simply a day of mourning and vowing to destroy Israel, or is there something more specific that he conjures up?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-of-hamas-leader-brings-hope-peril/7827062.html	2024-10-17T18:41:05-07:00	
Biden, Scholz to discuss antisemitism concerns during Germany meeting	berlin — U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will discuss increased reports of antisemitic acts in both countries over the last year as war has raged in the Middle East when they meet Friday in Berlin, a Biden administration official told reporters on the eve of Biden’s state visit to Germany. 'This is an area where the United States and Germany have worked very closely,' said the official, who was not named as a condition of the Wednesday night briefing. The official added that while Biden is unlikely to hold a specific event centered on antisemitism during his one-day visit, the issue is 'very important to President Biden, and one that he has, that we have, discussed with the German government over the years and continue to do so.' The official did not give any more details on engagements or plans. Watchdogs have sounded the alarm in both countries: According to a German government report, antisemitic incidents rose by about 83% last year. In the United States, the Anti-Defamation League has said that U.S. antisemitic incidents 'skyrocketed' in the months after Hamas militants attacked Israel last October. Biden has clearly tied the recent rise in anti-Jewish acts to a growing backlash over his staunch support of Israel. In May, he spoke at the first Holocaust Remembrance Day since the start of the war on October 7, 2023. He warned of a 'ferocious' rise in antisemitic incidents and said that, at the height of university protests, 'Jewish students [were] blocked, harassed, attacked, while walking to class.' He said protesters used 'antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world’s only Jewish state.' Earlier this month, he spoke of his belief that 'without an Israel, every Jew in the world’s security is less stable.' He added, 'It doesn’t mean that Jewish leadership doesn’t have to be more progressive than it is, but it does mean it has to exist, and that’s what worries me most about what’s going on now.' Germany’s World War II history makes it particularly sensitive to this type of hatred, but critics say it has taken steps that stifle legitimate criticism. In November, weeks into the Gaza conflict, a German museum canceled a show by a South African artist after she expressed support for the Palestinian cause. Candice Breitz, the artist, who is Jewish, called the act another example of 'Germany’s increasingly entrenched habit of weaponizing false charges of antisemitism against intellectuals and cultural workers of various descriptions.' In March, police canceled a conference of pro-Palestinian activists because a planned speaker had previously made antisemitic remarks. They blocked him from entering Germany and cut power to the Berlin building where conference participants had gathered to watch him on a livestream. On the first anniversary of the war, Scholz warned against growing anti-Jewish sentiment and affirmed his support for Israel. 'We will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel. The Jewish people here in Germany have the full solidarity of our state,' he said. A difficult definition Key to managing antisemitism is the question of whether criticism of Israel is, by definition, antisemitic. The Federal Association of Research and Information Centers for Antisemitism, Germany’s antisemitism watchdog, uses a working definition from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, describing antisemitism as 'a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.' Although its definition of antisemitism does not mention Israel, many of its cited examples of antisemitism do. The U.S. State Department also uses that definition, but when the White House produced its first strategy on antisemitism last year, before the start of the Gaza war, the strategy was not based solely on that definition. One Jewish rights group that worked with the White House on the strategy said the decision to codify the definition of antisemitism 'would only have made it harder to recognize and respond to antisemitic attacks in context' and 'would have opened the door to infringement of First Amendment rights.' That group, T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, also opposed a proposed bill in Congress using the group’s definition, with CEO Rabbi Jill Jacobs saying in a statement: 'The profoundly misguided Antisemitism Awareness Act does nothing to keep Jews safe, while also threatening the civil liberties fundamental to this country.' Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, who led the rollout of the White House strategy, said it is more important to look at what antisemitism does than what it is. 'At its core, antisemitism divides us, erodes our trust in government, institutions and one another,' he said. 'It threatens our democracy while undermining our American values of freedom, community and decency. Antisemitism delivers simplistic, false and dangerous narratives that have led to extremists perpetrating deadly violence against Jews.' History professor Jonathan Elukin of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, said the definition of antisemitism has shifted over the centuries. He focuses on antisemitism in the medieval and early modern periods — before Israel was founded. This iteration of antisemitism in the U.S., he told VOA, is 'more associated with a kind of larger sense of an anti-Western, anti-modern kind of feeling, both on the far right and on the far left. They both seem to be converging in some ways on resentment, hatred, suspicion, anxiety about the Jews.' As for the sentiment on the far right, he said, 'I think it's more a kind of tribal nostalgic sense that America is supposed to be or was thought to be kind of a Christian nation.' He said the debate over definitions obscures a problem. 'Does it even matter whether it fits some kind of arbitrary notion of antisemitism, which in itself is a very arbitrary and time-bound definition?' he asked. But, he said, talking about the problem is a start. 'In the short term, obviously it requires education, activism, political leadership to draw the line at acceptable or what's not acceptable expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment,' he said. 'Both here and abroad.' Kim Lewis contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-scholz-to-discuss-antisemitism-concerns-during-germany-meeting-/7827028.html	2024-10-17T17:51:59-07:00	
US extends immigration protections to Lebanese nationals	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced Thursday new guidelines offering temporary immigration protection to some Lebanese nationals in the United States, allowing them to remain and work in the country. These protections include Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) and a new Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Lebanon, following months of escalating conflict and instability in the region. Eligible Lebanese nationals who have been continuously residing in the U.S. since October 16, 2024, will be allowed to apply for TPS. However, those who arrived after this date will not be eligible. DHS plans to publish a notice in the Federal Register in the coming weeks, outlining the application process for TPS and employment authorization. Additionally, under President Joe Biden's July 26, 2024, directive, Deferred Enforced Departure is granted to Lebanese nationals. This allows them to apply for employment authorization valid through January 25, 2026. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) acknowledged the 'important measures' taken to protect Lebanese citizens from an active war zone but urged the U.S. to cease supplying Israel with the weapons being used in attacks on Lebanon. 'These are important protections extended by the Biden-Harris Administration, and a welcomed reprieve for the thousands of Lebanese nationals currently in the country because of the ongoing war on Lebanon by Israel,' ADC National Executive Director Abed Ayoub said in a statement. Ensuring that Lebanese nationals in the U.S. are not forced back into harm's way is an important step, said Ayoub. 'The expansion of Israel's genocide into Lebanon has already led to thousands of deaths, and a humanitarian crisis that is impacting millions of Lebanese residents. … However, the most important action the Biden-Harris Administration can immediately take is an immediate arms embargo on Israel, and implementation of an immediate ceasefire,' Ayoub said. U.S. Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan said in a statement that Michigan is home to many Lebanese Americans who live in fear for their families as Lebanon faces a worsening humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by a growing regional conflict. 'We have a responsibility to provide refuge to those seeking shelter from catastrophe and conflict, and I have long fought for Temporary Protected Status to provide safety and security to those who need it most,' she said. In response to Israel's war with Hezbollah, DHS is also easing certain rules for Lebanese on student visas who face 'serious financial hardship.' These students can now apply for work authorization, work more hours during the school year, and take a lighter course load, all while keeping their immigration status. Each case will be reviewed individually by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The combined DED and TPS actions are expected to benefit approximately 11,000 Lebanese nationals and about 1,740 F-1 students eligible for the special relief measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-extends-immigration-protections-to-lebanese-nationals-/7826726.html	2024-10-17T17:15:17-07:00	
New debate ignited over Seoul's right to nuclear reprocessing	washington — As North Korea escalates tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a new debate has ignited in Seoul over whether South Korea should have the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel — a step that would allow for the extraction of a fissile material that can be used to build nuclear weapons. According to the South Korean Embassy in Washington, Ambassador to the U.S. Cho Hyun-dong said last Friday that his government will work with the new U.S. administration that will be inaugurated in January to strengthen nuclear cooperation, including a discussion of the need for nuclear reprocessing in South Korea. Cho was responding to a question posed by one of a group of Korean lawmakers who were visiting the embassy for an annual parliamentary audit. The debate comes as North Korea ramps up its nuclear weapons programs and saber-rattling rhetoric. On Thursday, North Korea's state media said Pyongyang has 'clearly defined South Korea as a hostile country' through a revision of the constitution during a parliamentary meeting last week. Two days earlier, the North blew up the northern section of roads that once linked it with South Korea. Going nuclear South Korea faces growing internal calls to develop its own nuclear weapons. Some South Koreans argue that their country should at least have the nuclear reprocessing right — just as Japan, another key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region does — so South Korea could be ready to build nuclear arms as soon as it decides to do so. Nuclear reprocessing refers to the separation of spent nuclear reactor fuel into potentially reusable nuclear materials and other nuclear waste. The process helps managing radioactive waste more sustainably while extracting plutonium that can be used for nuclear weapons. Under the U.S.-South Korean Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation, signed in 2015 to replace a prior nuclear pact, South Korea's nuclear reprocessing is subject to further negotiation with the U.S. On the other hand, Japan has the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel at its facilities under the U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement. In a response to a VOA inquiry, the South Korean Foreign Ministry stressed that Cho's remark reflected the need to come up with measures to manage high-level radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel. 'The South Korean government continues to seek ways to manage high-level radioactive waste such as spent nuclear fuel,' a spokesperson for the South Korean Foreign Ministry told VOA's Korean Service via email on Wednesday. The spokesperson said securing the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel is 'an issue that should be carefully resolved by comprehensively taking into account various factors such as sensitivity, in terms of nuclear nonproliferation and economic feasibility.' 'The current South Korea-U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement took effect in 2015 and is valid until 2035, and we intend to continue to upgrade peaceful nuclear cooperation between South Korea and the U.S. while faithfully implementing the agreement,' the spokesperson added. The U.S. stressed that it has a long-standing policy to limit the spread of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities around the world. 'The U.S. strives to promote civil nuclear cooperation globally to advance our principles for the highest standards of safety, security, and non-proliferation,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed response on Thursday to a VOA Korean inquiry. 'The ROK and the United States have maintained a mutually beneficial relationship through nuclear cooperation for decades, including our two countries having maintained close cooperation to fulfill our duties in the global community to ensure the highest levels of safety, non-proliferation and security for the peaceful use of nuclear energy,' the spokesperson said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the country's formal name. Proliferation concerns U.S. experts say it is highly unlikely that Washington will give consent for Seoul to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, as that would pose a greater challenge to the nonproliferation regime. 'I understand that South Koreans may perceive that it isn't fair that the U.S. supported Japan's reprocessing but not South Korea's reprocessing of spent nuclear reactor fuel,' Toby Dalton, co‑director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an email Wednesday to VOA Korean. 'However, it is important to understand that the U.S. agreed to Japanese reprocessing in the 1970s, at a time when the U.S. had a policy more favorable to reprocessing.' Dalton said the current U.S. policy 'does not support reprocessing anywhere, largely because of the proliferation risk.' 'So, in the U.S. view, this is less an issue of fairness than of timing — Japan made a request before the U.S. policy change,' Dalton said. 'South Korea's interest in reprocessing came much later.' Robert Einhorn, a former special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA Korean via email Wednesday, 'Some South Koreans are now advocating indigenous reprocessing and uranium enrichment programs, not primarily for civil nuclear energy reasons, but to provide an option to produce the fissile material needed for nuclear weapons. 'It is understandable that the ROK seeks to strengthen deterrence against the growing North Korean nuclear threat, but Seoul and Washington are already pursuing the most effective way of countering that threat — strengthening the U.S.-ROK alliance and reinforcing the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent, including by giving South Koreans a much more important role in the planning and execution of that deterrent,' Einhorn said. Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA Korean via email Wednesday that reprocessing nuclear waste would bring South Korea a step closer to being able to pursue its own nuclear weapons capability. That would be 'something the U.S. opposes, given the likelihood of a nuclear arms race in the region if South Korea has nuclear weapons,' he said. 'Occasional hints by ROK officials of South Korea's interest in developing nuclear weapons and the advocacy by some ROK National Assembly members for the ROK to develop a latent nuclear weapons capability are probably unnerving U.S. policymakers and will likely stiffen their opposition to allowing reprocessing by the ROK,' said Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, in an email Wednesday to VOA Korean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-debate-ignited-over-seoul-s-right-to-nuclear-reprocessing/7826698.html	2024-10-17T16:48:26-07:00	
US: Hamas leader’s death is opportunity for ‘political settlement’ for Israelis, Palestinians	President Joe Biden said Thursday that the death of Yahya Sinwar was an opportunity for a 'political settlement' between Israelis and Palestinians. Biden spoke shortly after the Israel Defense Forces said it had killed Sinwar, mastermind of Hamas’ terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Kenyan lawmakers impeach deputy president, remove him from office	nairobi, kenya — Kenyan lawmakers voted Thursday to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office over accusations of gross misconduct, irregular acquisition of wealth, undermining of the president and ethnic division, among other charges. Lawmakers proceeded with the impeachment even after Gachagua fell ill. The Senate approved five of the 11 charges against him, immediately removing him from office, the speaker of the Senate, Amason Kingi, announced a little before midnight. Gachagua, who was supposed to testify on his own behalf, was admitted to the hospital before he could do so with what his lawyers described as severe chest pains. The proceedings were suspended but eventually resumed. Gachagua had denied all the charges against him. Javas Bigambo, a Kenyan lawyer and governance consultant, watched the proceedings. The deputy president and his lawyers worked hard 'to remove the aspect of criminal liability of the DP' but failed to separate him 'from the political culpability or responsibility in the number of offenses leveled against him,' Bigambo said. Gachagua’s lawyers walked out of the Senate chamber when their plea to adjourn the proceedings until next Tuesday was rejected. Another motion to postpone the proceedings until Saturday to meet a 10-day constitutional deadline was defeated as well. On the Senate floor, some lawmakers argued against impeaching Gachagua. They said that some of the accusations were unfounded and that not enough proof had been given to justify impeachment. Some said they wished Gachagua could have been present to respond to the accusations in person. Bigambo said this was a historic moment for Kenya, the region and constitutional democracy. The president could nominate a new deputy within 14 days and send the name to the National Assembly, which would then have 60 days to approve it. But Bigambo said things might move much faster. He said it was possible that the president could forward his nomination to lawmakers tomorrow. The National Assembly is scheduled to have a special sitting then to address other matters, and lawmakers could also consider the nomination 'because next week they are going on recess.' He said the nominee 'may be sworn in by Saturday.' Bigambo added that if Gachagua hoped to challenge his impeachment in court, his earliest opportunity would be after a national holiday on Monday. By that time, Bigambo said, it could be too late for the court to act. Meanwhile, the doctor who treated Gachagua told reporters outside the hospital that his condition was stable, but that he would be kept at the hospital for observation for about 48 to 72 hours.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-lawmakers-impeach-deputy-president-remove-him-from-office/7826727.html	2024-10-17T16:28:03-07:00	
Panel urges Secret Service overhaul in response to Trump shooting	An independent panel formed to investigate the performance of the Secret Service after an assassination attempt in July against former President Donald Trump has called for extensive changes to the agency, including the installation of new leadership from the outside. In a report issued Thursday morning, the panel praised the bravery of the individual agents who work to protect political figures in the United States. However, it blasted their leaders for creating an internal culture that has become 'bureaucratic, complacent and static,' with the result that 'the Secret Service does not perform at the elite levels needed to discharge its critical mission.' Without 'fundamental reform,' the panel warned, other attacks on the agency's protectees 'can and will happen again.' In a statement, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. said, 'We respect the work of the Independent Review Panel and will carefully examine the report and recommendations released today.' He added that the agency has started making changes as a result of the attempted assassination. 'We have already significantly improved our readiness, operational and organizational communications and implemented enhanced protective operations for the former president and other protectees,' Rowe said. Failure in Pennsylvania President Joe Biden established the panel after a July 13 episode in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which a young man with a rifle was able to get within a few hundred meters of Trump while he was delivering a campaign speech. The would-be assassin fired several shots; Trump's right ear was struck, but he was not seriously wounded. One bystander was killed, and two others were seriously wounded, before a Secret Service countersniper team killed the gunman. In the aftermath of the incident, it became clear that there had been multiple failures leading up to the assassination attempt. The gunman was identified as a potential danger in advance of the shooting but was not prevented from accessing the roof of a building with a clear line of sight to the stage where Trump was speaking. In the minutes leading up to the shooting, law enforcement officials in the crowd were made aware of the shooter's presence, but because of poor coordination of communications, the information was not relayed to the members of Trump's protective detail near the stage. Panel's recommendations The panel's findings include calls for specific changes to the way the Secret Service handles large events such as the Trump rally in Butler. While the Secret Service has primary responsibility for the security of such events, it relies on other law enforcement agencies, including state and local police, for assistance. The report calls for having a unified command post at events like the Butler rally that would allow better communication among various agencies. The report also calls for creating specific plans for dealing with all locations within 914 meters (1,000 yards) of an event that offer line-of-sight vision of the protectee, overhead surveillance of all outdoor events, improved communication systems and other changes. Leadership change In the wake of the Butler shooting, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as Secret Service director and was temporarily replaced by Rowe. However, the report issued Thursday calls for a much more extensive shakeup of the agency's higher echelons. Citing 'an urgent need for fresh thinking informed by external experience and perspective,' the panel recommended that a new director, drawn from outside the Secret Service, be put in place and 'be allowed to bring in the leadership team he or she thinks most fit.' The new leadership would be charged with addressing multiple problems identified by the investigation, including 'a troubling lack of critical thinking' within the agency and 'corrosive cultural attitudes regarding resourcing and 'doing more with less.' ' The report also urged a refocusing of the agency on its protective duties, to the point of potentially 'shedding certain peripheral responsibilities,' including complex investigations into financial fraud and counterfeiting. 'More with less' Ronald Kessler, an author and journalist who has written two books about the Secret Service, told VOA that the panel correctly identified a number of problems with the agency. In particular, he cited the 'do more with less' ethos, which he said has been present in the agency since it was folded into the Department of Homeland Security more than 20 years ago. Kessler said it has become a point of pride in the agency that it operates on a shoestring rather than demanding more funding and resources. 'It's a recipe for mediocrity and just the opposite of what anybody would want in any organization,' he said. Within the agency, Kessler said, 'the way to be promoted has been, 'You don't make waves, you don't ask for more money, you don't point out problems, you don't expose the fact that the technical systems that are just basic don't work.' ' Kessler praised the decision to seek outside leadership. 'In any organization, when it's failing, you bring in outside people, whether it's a private company or a government agency, and the people do respond,' he said. Doubts about outside leadership Paul Eckloff, a 23-year veteran of the agency who served as the assistant special agent in charge of the protection details of Presidents Barack Obama and Trump, said he doubted the wisdom of seeking outside leadership for an agency as unique as the Secret Service. 'The report is indicative of some fundamental misunderstandings of how the Secret Service operates, and these misunderstandings would be shared by any outside leader,' he told VOA. 'It would exacerbate problems within the rank and file, who believe that they are not well represented,' Eckloff said. 'If the complaint about Secret Service leadership was that they were detached from the operators on the ground — [a job] they ostensibly have done before — imagine a leader who never held a post. How detached would they be?' Eckloff also warned that requiring the agency to focus exclusively on its protective mission would be counterproductive. Serving on a protective detail is extremely intense work, he said, with agents often working weeks at a time without a day off. For that reason, the agency tries to limit the time agents are assigned directly to a protective detail to periods of five to eight years, after which they rotate off and move into investigative work. This leaves the agency with a deep pool of experienced agents who can be called upon to assist in protective details at times when the agency needs to surge its capacity, which occurs at least every four years during presidential elections. The panel reviewed the attack from early August through early October. Members were Mark Filip, a former federal judge and former deputy attorney general; David Mitchell, a former superintendent of the Maryland State Police; Janet Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security; and Frances Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panel-urges-secret-service-overhaul-in-response-to-trump-shooting-/7826708.html	2024-10-17T16:01:13-07:00	
Namibia hosts workshop on health care access to LGBTQ+ community	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibians who are part of the LGBTQ+ community often find it difficult to get decent health care and many report discriminatory practices within the health care system. For example, when 20-year-old Immanuel Uirab sought contraception at a health facility, the nurse on duty would not assist him. 'I don’t know if it’s the shorts I was wearing or you can generally just tell by looking at me that I am gay,' he said, 'but then this particular nurse ... came out and she was, like, ‘No, we don’t offer contraceptives for people who practice sodomy. We can’t do that for you. ... You can go buy them if you want to use them in your private space, but we ... won’t give them to you because our government does not support homosexuality.’' A recent two-day training workshop facilitated by the group Our Equity Advocacy was aimed at encouraging health care practitioners in Namibia to not discriminate against sexual minorities. Discrimination in health care services violates the right to health care and the human rights principles of equity, privacy and dignity, said the United Nation’s special rapporteur on the right to health, Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng. Mofokeng held a workshop last weekend in Windhoek where she trained health care practitioners and young people about the role of health care in human rights. There are many opportunities in which health care workers 'can take a seat at the table,' she said. 'Not just in policymaking, but importantly in advocacy ... also in understanding human rights.' The executive director of Namibia’s Ministry of Health, Ben Nangombe, said that discrimination in health care based on sexual orientation is against the law and that practitioners who refuse health care to patients for any reason can lose their jobs. 'The official position [of the] government on this matter is that the Namibian government provides health care services to all Namibians who need it without any discrimination whatsoever,' he said. One theme from last weekend’s workshop was the need for nurses to become agents of change and advocates for their patients. Letlhogonolo Mokgoroane, a legal practitioner and health rights activist from South Africa who co-facilitated the workshop, said members of sexual minority groups in Africa often face intrusive questioning when they seek medical care. 'Let’s say you are going to a hospital or a clinic for a broken arm or a headache, some tummy ache, whatever,' Mokgoroane said. 'What often happens is when you are trans or when you are gender nonconforming or when you are a member of the LGBTI community, immediately what happens is that the questions veer away from why you are actually there to really invasive and discriminatory questions, right? ‘I have a headache, why are you asking me about my sex life? ... I have a headache, why are you asking me about my genitalia?’' Mokgoroane said the issue can be addressed by training health care workers to affirm the gender of their patients when they treat them. However, Mokgoroane expressed worry that the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ laws in Africa will further drive discriminatory practices in the health care system and undermine public health altogether.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-hosts-workshop-on-health-care-access-to-lgbtq-community/7826659.html	2024-10-17T15:23:53-07:00	
Turkey's ruling party uses misinformation to downplay scope of femicide	The government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing mounting criticism over the rise of gender-based violence in Turkey, which ranks among the world's worst countries for violence against women. Just last week in Istanbul, a 19-year-old Turkish man killed two young women — first, his 19-year-old girlfriend at his home, and then a woman, also 19, whom he met in the city. He beheaded the second victim and threw her head over a wall onto a crowded street before taking his own life. Critics contend that the traditional values-based policies of Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) are contributing to a growing number of femicides — the killing of women — and Turkey's entrenched domestic violence problem. 'We Will Stop Femicide Platform,' a Turkish advocacy group known by the initials KCDP, reported 3,185 women were killed by men between 2008 and 2019, and at least 1,499 from 2020 to September 2024, with the number of femicides rising each year. The deaths of about 1,030 women were also found suspicious. More than 1.4 million women reported they had faced domestic abuse between January 2013 and July 2024, the Turkish Minute news site reported, citing data received from the Family and Social Services Ministry by the daily newspaper Birgün. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Istanbul and other cities in Turkey last week accusing Erdogan of failing to protect women from violence. In the facing of such accusations, Erdogan vowed last week to strengthen legal regulations concerning crimes against women and children and promised to set up a new unit at the Justice Ministry to monitor such cases. However, the Bursa Women's Platform, which organized sit-in protests in Turkey's Bursa province, accused Turkish authorities of acting only on 'social media reactions rather than the testimonies of those subjected to violence.' Human Rights Foundation, a New York-headquartered international watchdog, accused the Erdogan government this week of failing to 'adequately prevent femicide and violence against women, children, and gender minorities.' The Turkish government exercises 'increasing control over social media platforms' posing 'serious threats to freedom of expression,' the HRF said Thursday in a letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Independent research published this year in Frontiers in Psychology argued that the Turkish government's tightening grip over what people can see in the media and the ruling party's gender policies based on the stereotypes of women's societal role and appearances contribute to the stigmatization of feminism and dehumanization of women. Erdogan's own words have been cited as contributing to the problem. In widely quoted remarks made in 2014, he said it is 'against nature' to 'put men and women on equal footing,' and argued that feminists do not understand the importance of motherhood. 'President Erdogan and the AKP have increasingly taken an explicitly anti-feminist stance, in particular over the last decade. Consequently, anti-feminism in Turkey has taken on a top-down outlook,' said a recent article in the peer-reviewed academic journal Mediterranean Politics. The article said an 'environment created by the AKP' had empowered anti-feminist actors in Turkey to push back against legal reforms advocating for gender equality and women's rights. The paper uncovered an AKP-linked Turkish network of social media accounts including conservative civil society organizations, media representatives, social media influencers, writers and academics, celebrities' who articulate and amplify anti-feminist sentences, while exerting 'significant influence in political sphere.' VoxEU, a forum for columns by leading economists, published a study in March finding that victim-blaming is common in Turkish society, along with an attitude that a woman should not provoke her husband. Hardliners from Erdogan's party have argued that a man's testimony should be given more weight than a woman's in domestic violence cases. Turkish judges hand down lenient sentences to domestic abusers, or otherwise impose minimal sanctions against abusers who violate civil protection orders. Law enforcement, the analysts and activists say, is often slow to react to instances when these civil protection orders are violated. KCDP and others have documented instances when women were killed by men against whom they had taken out restraining orders. Women are particularly prone to facing violence at home, and the perpetrators are overwhelmingly spouses, men they are romantically involved with, family members, or other acquaintances. In July 2021, Turkey withdrew from The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention. Turkey was the first country to sign the Istanbul Convention in May 2011. Turkish authorities claimed to be acting because the Istanbul Convention had been 'hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalize homosexuality,' which it said, 'is incompatible with' the country's 'social and family values.' On October 8, Erdogan said Turkey's 'withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention has not had the slightest negative impact on women's rights,' adding 'there is no opposition party that can teach us a lesson on women's rights' or 'help us strengthen women's status.' Republican People's Party leader Ozgur Ozel disagreed. 'This government has not only failed to protect women and children but is also stepping back from positive actions. The clearest example is the sudden withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention in 2021,' Turkiye Today cited Ozel as saying on October 8.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-ruling-party-uses-misinformation-to-downplay-scope-of-femicide-/7826624.html	2024-10-17T15:18:58-07:00	
Georgia’s civil society teams up to monitor crucial election, defying 'foreign agent' law	As the Republic of Georgia prepares to hold crucial elections on October 26, there are fears that the ruling Georgian Dream party may not easily give up power.

Botswana's electoral body warns opposition about rigging claims	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana’s election commission is warning opposition parties against what it calls 'reckless' claims of poll rigging ahead of the October 30 general election, even as some opposition leaders insist that cheating is happening. The Independent Electoral Commission’s chief public relations officer, Osupile Maroba, said allegations that dead people’s names have been placed on the roll of registered voters are false, disrespectful and absurd. Even so, Moeti Mohwasa, a spokesperson for the opposition coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change, insisted his party knows about plans to rig elections and even accused the electoral commission of enlisting the services of Zimbabwean authorities to do so. 'The IEC is working in collaboration with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to assist it in the game that they master most — that is, cheating in the elections,' Mohwasa said. 'The Central Intelligence Organization of Zimbabwe is working with the Directorate of Intelligence and Security in Botswana to achieve the same.' Mohwasa said the Umbrella for Democratic Change will petition the Zimbabwean Embassy in Gaborone next week over its election concerns. The Botswana Congress Party, which is not part of the opposition alliance, is equally concerned the poll will be marred by irregularities. BCP spokesperson Mpho Pheko said the party worries in particular about the counting of votes away from polling stations. 'The BCP has always held the position that elections in Botswana are free but not fair,' Pheko said, recounting that BCP President Dumelang Saleshando proposed a motion in parliament that the law should be reviewed to allow for ballots to be counted where they were cast. 'But the majority refused, insisting on the transportation of ballot boxes,' Pheko said. Kgalalelo Kentse of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party said that the opposition parties’ claims are a sign of desperation and that they made the same assertions during the 2019 election but could not prove them in court. Burundi-based Raphael Bindariye, program manager of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, previously worked as an electoral officer in United Nations missions in Africa. He said opposition concerns over election rigging in Africa emanate from how electoral bodies are managed. 'It is how impartial, how independent, how natural the electoral management bodies are in Africa,' Bindariye said. 'How are they set up, who is setting them up, where do they get results from? It is generally from the government. It is generally from the ruling parties that have more means and is the one managing the national resources in the country.' More than 2,000 Botswanan citizens living abroad, along with local election officials and police, will cast votes this Saturday. The rest of the more than 1 million local voters will get their turn on October 30.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-s-electoral-body-warns-opposition-about-rigging-claims/7826626.html	2024-10-17T15:13:13-07:00	
Russian meddling threatens Moldovan election, EU referendum	Moldovan analysts are warning of a Russian 'large-scale hybrid war' against their country as it moves toward a presidential election on Sunday, when a referendum on future relations with the European Union will also be held. Moldova’s incumbent president, Maia Sandu, supports the country’s integration with Europe and enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion polls over her 11 challengers. Sunday’s referendum will ask Moldovan voters whether they support declaring the country’s EU accession as a strategic goal in its constitution. In an interview with Voice of America’s Russian Service, Victor Zhuk, director of Moldovan State University’s Institute of Legal, Political and Sociological Research, said that Russia believes now is the time to direct all its efforts to preventing Moldova from taking the 'European path.' 'There will be a referendum and presidential elections now, and parliamentary elections in 2025, so Russia believes that it is necessary to conduct a large-scale hybrid war against our country,' he said. According to Zhuk, three of the candidates running against Sandu are 'pro-Russian politicians.' He added that while a fourth candidate, former prosecutor and lawmaker Alexandr Stoianoglo, 'personally advocates the European path of Moldova,' he was nominated by the Party of Socialists, led by former Moldovan President Igor Dodon, 'who also opposes the referendum and the European path.' 'So, the Russian Federation has the ability to torpedo public consciousness in the republic from the outside with various fake news, and there are political parties inside that destabilize the situation and oppose Moldova's accession to the EU,' Zhuk said. Alleged attempts at bribery Sergiu Musteata, a Moldovan historian and dean of the history and geography faculty of Moldova’s Ion Creanga State Pedagogical University, contended that Russia has attempted to 'bribe' Moldovan voters to cast their ballots in a way that serves Russia’s interests. He alleged that this attempted bribery involved people connected to Ilan Shor, a fugitive pro-Russian Moldovan oligarch. 'Various people from Ilan Shor's entourage and even priests were invited to Moscow for instructions, from where they returned with money,' Musteata told VOA. 'Now the special services and police of the Republic of Moldova have spoken out on this matter and stated that more than $100 million has been invested in this election campaign against Maia Sandu and against the referendum.' Earlier this year, Shor reportedly obtained Russian citizenship and identity documents after being sentenced in June 2023 to 15 years in prison for alleged involvement in a $1 billion bank fraud and other illicit schemes. That same month, Moldova's Constitutional Court declared Shor’s pro-Moscow opposition party unconstitutional. Shor has been sanctioned by the U.S. and EU for attempts to destabilize Moldova. According to Musteata, Russia is supporting candidates in Moldova who oppose Sandu while at the same time 'calling for a boycott of the referendum, which is very important for the future pro-European vector of the country.' More than 33% of eligible voters must participate for the referendum to be considered valid. 'Inevitable' move Sandu has consistently condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — a position that, according to Zhuk, is shared by a majority of Moldova’s voters. 'Of course, they always think that in the event of Ukraine’s defeat, Russia's aggression against the Republic of Moldova is practically inevitable,' he said. On Tuesday, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters in Washington: 'In recent months, the U.S. government, Moldovan President Sandu, the Moldovan security services, and other allies and partners have warned that Russia is seeking to undermine Moldovan democratic institutions in the lead-up to the presidential election and referendum on Moldova’s EU membership. 'Now, with Moldova’s election just days away, we remain confident in our earlier assessment that Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration.' Kirby said Russia in recent months has put millions of dollars 'toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favor of their campaigns.' He added that Shor 'has invested tens of millions of dollars per month into nonprofit organizations that spread narratives about the election that are in line with Russian interests.' Kirby concluded by saying that 'the United States will continue to support Moldova and the Moldovan people, and to expose and counter Russian efforts to undermine Moldovan democracy.'

Georgian groups defy 'foreign agent' law, team up to monitor crucial election	TBILISI, GEORGIA — An uneasy calm has descended on the streets of Tbilisi ahead of a crucial election on October 26, widely seen as a referendum on Georgia’s future. Beneath the surface, there is palpable tension. Campaign billboards, most for the ruling Georgian Dream Party, vie for voters’ attention with countless European Union, NATO and Ukrainian flags hanging from windows and graffitied on the city’s red brick buildings alongside anti-Russian slogans. Six months ago, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Tbilisi to protest the reintroduction of a so-called 'foreign agent' law, which compels any organization receiving more than 20% of its funding from overseas to register with the government and submit to detailed financial investigation. A brutal crackdown on the demonstrations prompted Western powers to impose sanctions on some Georgian officials. Critics say the law mimics Russian legislation used to silence political opponents and independent media. The Georgian government insists the law is necessary to show who is funding political organizations. Defiance The foreign agent law came into force in September. However, most foreign-funded civil society groups have refused to comply. Dozens of the organizations are now working together to act as election monitors amid fears that Georgian Dream may not easily give up power, even if they lose the election. Among the chief targets of the foreign agent law is Eka Gigauri, head of the anti-corruption group Transparency International. Alongside other prominent civil society leaders, she appears on government propaganda posters, accused of selling out Georgia and getting rich on foreign money. Their faces are marked with red crosses. 'This is a matter of dignity,' Gigauri told VOA. 'We are not spies. We are not undermining the interests of the country. We are the patriots of this country, and we served this country and the people of this country for many years.' Transparency International has refused to register as a foreign agent, risking prosecution and heavy fines for the organization and its staff. 'We are using all the legal tools, everything, to fight, to resist, not to comply, to inform the citizens about the wrongdoings of the government,' she said. 'Still, we see that at any time, the government can enforce this law. 'And now especially, when there is this preelection period and the majority of the NGOs are involved in observing the elections, definitely it will be [an] additional obstacle for us if it happens. However, it did not happen yet.' Transparency International said most foreign-funded civil society organizations have refused to comply with the new law, with only 41 organizations having so far registered as foreign agents. Free media Tabula Media, an independent multimedia organization, is one of several groups seeking to circumvent the legislation. 'We had to reestablish the organization in an EU country — Estonia — which deeply complicates financial operations,' Tabula editor-in-chief Levan Sutidze told VOA. 'We are familiar with this path and where it leads. It leads to Russia, to the complete silencing of critical voices, to the annihilation of independent media outlets and NGOs, and it will have catastrophic consequences in the future,' Sutidze said. 'Even if the situation worsens, we will not submit to this insult.' The investigative organization Realpolitika has also registered its headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia, in a bid to avoid prosecution under the foreign agent law. 'For now, this law does not apply to us. However, this could change after the election,' said editor-in-chief Aka Zarqua. 'Pressure from the international community and the backlash within Georgian society have both contributed to the government not fully enforcing this legislation before the election, and we can see their partial retreat,' Zarqua said. 'It’s clear that October 26 will be decisive in this regard.' Backlash For some civil society groups, navigating the foreign agent law has been a traumatic process. The pro-democracy organization Shame was founded in 2019 after the ruling Georgian Dream Party allowed a visiting Russian prime minister to address lawmakers from the speaker’s chair in the Georgian parliament, prompting widespread outrage. In August, the organization decided to comply with the foreign agent law and register with the government 'because we believed there was no other way to save the organization and continue its work if Georgian Dream somehow managed to win the election and the law remained enforced,' according to Dachi Imedadze, Shame’s head of strategy. The organization, however, reversed its decision after a bitter public backlash. 'It escalated into conspiracy theories and personal attacks, with people calling us traitors,' Imedadze said. Shame is now campaigning to get young people to vote. 'One-third of young people, aged 18 to 25, do not participate in elections. This represents approximately 250,000 potential voters,' Imedadze told VOA. 'Our main target audience is this group, many of whom will be voting for the first time in this election.' 'Russian swamp' Nino Lomjaria, a former public defender of Georgia, now heads Georgia’s European Orbit, a civil society group partly funded by the U.S.-based Soros Foundation. Lomjaria and her team have traveled across the country urging people to turn out and vote. Their election leaflets mimic the election ballot but offer only two choices. 'It says: ‘Are you choosing European well-being or the Russian swamp?’' she said. Georgian Dream insists it is not pro-Russian and wants to join the EU. Party leaders say they are seeking to improve relations with Moscow to avoid further conflict, accusing critics and rivals of being part of a 'global war party' that is seeking to profit from war with Russia. Lomjaria scoffs at that accusation. 'We know who starts wars. We know that the ‘global war party’ is Russia. It's not the West. And for us, the European Union is the safe place. That's why we want to join this community, because we consider that being the member of the European Union, being the member of NATO, this is something where we will find peace and stability,' she told VOA. Election monitors Georgia’s European Orbit has joined a coalition of nongovernmental organizations that are planning to monitor the election, 'which is composed of up to 30 organizations,' Lomjaria said. 'And our plan is to be present at every polling station to observe the whole process of voting and vote tabulation. We will have evidence of how elections have been conducted in this country, and we will litigate if we find out that there was some manipulation or electoral fraud,' she said. Gigauri of Transparency International doubts Georgia’s judicial system is robust enough to cope with such a crisis. 'The state institutions in Georgia are captured. This is a very unfortunate fact and the reality. Definitely it's very difficult for everyone to operate. But we also see that more and more, it is very difficult for those institutions to deal with the resistance from the people,' Gigauri told VOA. The government insists it will respect the election result. 'Georgian Dream is based on democratic principles, and therefore it will respect every decision made by the Georgian people. We will accept the people's decision, whatever it may be,' Nikoloz Samkharadze, chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA in an interview.

China hosts World Media Summit in Xinjiang amid human rights concerns	washington — China hosted its sixth World Media Summit this week in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, in northwestern China. Organizers say more than 500 participants from 208 leading media organizations participated in the event, which was cohosted by state-run Xinhua News Agency and the Xinjiang regional government. The three-day summit, which ended on Thursday, focused on 'Artificial Intelligence and Media Transformation.' Chinese media highlighted the potential benefits of global AI collaboration, but the choice of Xinjiang as the event's venue was criticized by activists concerned about China's alleged human rights abuses in the region. Adrian Zenz, director of China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, told VOA he believes organizers chose Urumqi to draw attention away from human rights concerns in Xinjiang. 'This event appears to be designed to normalize the situation in Xinjiang, making Xinjiang a location for discussing modern technology and developments,' Zenz said in an emailed response. 'As Erkin Tuniyaz [chairman of the region] told the media at the event, 'Xinjiang is open for business.' This points to the current strategy of Xinjiang's [Chinese Communist] party secretary Ma Xingrui to focus on economic development and technological modernization,' Zenz told VOA. Zenz said that this is 'an integral part of Xinjiang's strategy to present itself as a modern, developed and safe region — showcasing the alleged success of China's 'deradicalization' measures.'' In Xinjiang, China faces numerous allegations of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities, including mass detentions and forced labor. Since 2017, more than 1 million people have reportedly been detained in internment camps, with human rights groups estimating that more than half a million have been sentenced through unfair trials. The U.S. has labeled these actions as genocide, imposing sanctions on Chinese officials and companies. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, enacted in 2022, bans products from Xinjiang unless proven free of forced labor. China denies these claims, asserting that the camps serve as vocational training centers to combat extremism. However, satellite imagery, survivor testimonies and leaked documents contradict these assertions, resulting in widespread global condemnation. Summit reactions Originally launched in 2009, the World Media Summit was initiated by the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency, with participation from leading international media organizations such as The Associated Press, Reuters and Russia's TASS, according to Xinhua. Some attendees at this year's session dismissed allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang as 'fake news,' according to a Xinhua report. 'Actually, what I found during my visit to Xinjiang was amazing. Because in the media, we hear about fake news about Xinjiang. But when we came to the field and we see the development of Xinjiang, it's amazing,' Waref Komaiha, president of the Silk Road Institute for Studies and Research, told Xinhua. Representatives from global media organizations, including Reuters, participated in the summit. Ling-Sze Gan, Reuters head of media sales for the Asia Pacific, said at the summit's opening, 'We are particularly excited about the potential of generative AI ... augmenting our journalists with machines to supercharge their ability to do their jobs.' Uyghur activists voice concerns Uyghur activists condemned the summit, calling it an endorsement of China's policies in Xinjiang. Mamtimin Ala, president of the Washington-based East Turkistan Government in Exile, or ETGE, which seeks the independence of Xinjiang from China, criticized the involvement of major media organizations. 'It is disheartening that these esteemed media organizations have chosen to partake in a Chinese propaganda event. Their presence provides unwarranted legitimacy to China's colonial and genocidal policies in East Turkistan,' he said in a statement posted on the organization's website. Uyghur activists refer to the region of Xinjiang as East Turkistan, a name tied to the area's historical and political background. Xinjiang, which means 'new frontier' in Chinese, is the official name used by the Chinese government. Similarly, ETGE's foreign affairs chief Salih Hudayar voiced concern that the summit could further China's global propaganda efforts. 'We fear that events like this summit, coupled with China's geopolitical influence, will lead to an even more extensive campaign of media manipulation and propaganda aimed at transforming global perceptions of its atrocities in East Turkistan,' Hudayar told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-hosts-world-media-summit-in-xinjiang-amid-human-rights-concerns/7826463.html	2024-10-17T12:38:19-07:00	
Suicide bomber kills 7 in Somali capital	washington — Police in Somalia say a suicide bomber killed at least seven people Thursday when he detonated an explosives-laden vest in front of a crowded restaurant in the capital, Mogadishu. Somali police said the attack occurred around 3:30 p.m. local time, stating that the suicide blast occurred in front of a restaurant near the city’s main police facility. 'The attack carried out by a suicide bomber targeted a resting shade in front of a café near the School Polizia Facility, killing at least seven people and six others were injured,' said a statement from the police. It said the casualties included police officials and civilians. Witnesses said among those killed was a famous Somali comedian, Sugal Abdulle, and a police officer in charge of the security of Turkish-built Yardim Eli specialist hospital in Mogadishu. 'The suicide bomber blew himself in the middle of civilians and members of the police officers, staying under trees in front of the restaurant,' Osman Nur Aden, a witness told VOA Somali. The location of the attack is also near the city's heavily secured international airport that is home to some foreign embassies, and U.N. and African Union bases. The attack also came during a visit to the city by the United Nations Under-Secretary-General Rosemary A. DiCarlo. The Somali National News Agency, SONNA, reported that Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud met with DiCarlo Thursday at the presidential palace. 'The meeting focused on further strengthening the longstanding partnership between Somalia and the United Nations, while exploring ways to accelerate UN efforts in support of Somalia’s priorities,' a government statement said. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the police said it 'has the hallmarks of al-Shabab' even without a formal claim. The Islamist militant group has launched assaults and suicide bombings against dozens of public gathering spots in Mogadishu over the past 15 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/suicide-bomber-kills-7-in-somali-capital-/7826462.html	2024-10-17T12:00:13-07:00

Nigeria to review gasoline transport safety protocols after deadly blast	Abuja, Nigeria — Authorities in Nigeria have announced plans to review safety protocols for the transportation of gasoline after a deadly tanker accident and explosion in Jigawa state killed more than 140 people Wednesday. President Bola Tinubu said the review will be 'swift and comprehensive,' but some observers are skeptical that safety standards will improve. The tanker crashed in the village of Majiya and a short time later burst into flames, killing and injuring many who had gathered around the wreckage to scoop up spilled fuel. Tinubu said a review of transport protocols for gasoline will be carried out in partnership with various state authorities and that offenders of the new regulations will be punished. It is not clear what the new regulations will be. The president also sent top government officials including his defense and transportation ministers, along with food aid and medical supplies, to the site of Wednesday’s crash. Economic analyst Eze Onyekpere said he doesn’t expect any new measures from authorities. 'It is a very unfortunate situation and position because the leadership of the country has not been proactive about planning for transporting of whether it's crude oil or refined petroleum,' Onyekpere said. 'The government is not known to think through issues, they just latch on when there's a public outburst.' The accident in Jigawa comes barely one month after another tanker exploded after it collided with a truck in Niger state, killing 48 people. Tinubu has ordered the Federal Road Safety Corps, or FRSC, to strengthen enforcement of already existing road transport protocols, including regulations on night travels and official patrols. Energy expert Chukudi Victor Odoeme said the new measures are welcome, but is skeptical about compliance. 'The federal government thinking at this point that it's the time to put policies in place is a good one, but the only snag I see in this is compliance,' he said. 'It has to do with enforcement, it's not actually about the laws. Load limits have always been there, but it has never been enforced. They have to do a lot of enforcement, I don't think it's in creating new policies.' Nigeria’s 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) of oil pipelines are often prone to vandalism, and petrol suppliers mostly rely on tankers to transport fuel around the country. But due to poorly maintained roads and disregard for existing road measures, tanker accidents are common. Onyekpere said the government needs to repair and protect the pipelines. 'If those pipelines were secured and maintained, that would have been the cheapest and easiest way of transporting these things in such a manner that would not expose Nigerians to a lot of risk,' Onyekpere said. In 2020, more than 500 people died from about 1,500 tanker accidents, according to the FRSC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-to-review-gasoline-transport-safety-protocols-after-deadly-blast/7826391.html	2024-10-17T11:15:11-07:00

Media in 3 Afghan provinces banned from showing images of living beings	Washington — The Taliban has ordered media in three provinces of Afghanistan to stop airing images of any living being, a drastic step widely criticized by journalism and civil liberty groups. A Taliban official said this week that state-run media in the provinces of Takhar, Kandahar, and Maidan Wardak have been told to stop showing images of living things. Experts who spoke with VOA said the Taliban also met with local media outlets and told them that the rule also applied to their coverage. The order — part of the new morality law — will be implemented across the country, according to Saiful Islam Khyber, a spokesperson for the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. 'The law applies to all Afghanistan,' he told the French news agency AFP. The spokesperson added that the Taliban will convince people that taking images of living things is against Islamic law. The ban on images is part of a newly passed law based on the Taliban interpretation of Islam. The law also orders media to not mock Muslims or contradict Islamic law, and further curtails the rights of women. Officials have not detailed what the penalties will be but under the last Taliban rule, from 1996 to 2001, people could be imprisoned for showing images. Mohammad Graan, president of the Afghanistan chapter of the South Asian Association of Reporters Club and Journalists Forum, or SJF, told VOA the new instructions are worrying to the media. Graan added that independent media outlets in Takhar and Maidan Wardak provinces have also been told not to air images of living things. 'Unfortunately, journalists and media outlets are very concerned as it looks like they [Taliban] are implementing the new morality law gradually in provinces,' said Graan. 'It will undoubtedly impact journalists’ work and mental health, as well as create fear among journalists whether they will be able to continue their profession,' he said. Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, journalists have worked under increased censorship and restrictions. Added to the challenges, said Graan, is that journalists and media outlets do not know whether Taliban leaders are all on the same page about the new restrictions. 'The Taliban say that taking pictures or videos is forbidden, but they talk at press conferences in front of TV cameras and appear on TV,' he said. The United Nations and rights groups expressed concerns over the morality law, with the U.N. calling it a 'distressing vision' for Afghanistan, and saying that it imposes severe restrictions on personal freedom and repressing women in the country. The law gives the Taliban's morality police 'discretionary powers to threaten and detain anyone based on broad and sometimes vague lists of infractions,' said Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The Taliban imposed similar restrictions during their first rule in the late 1990s. At that time, no one was allowed to take pictures, watch television or use the internet. The Taliban, however, did not impose immediate restrictions on images after they returned to power in August 2021. Officials routinely use video and the internet for their propaganda. Afghan journalist Ghulam Jilani Zwak told VOA the restrictions are 'unprecedented' and that no other Muslim-majority countries have imposed such restrictions. Most Islamic scholars globally see no issue with showing living beings in photo or video. 'I think because [the Taliban’s government] is an authoritarian regime, it fears freedom of expression and press; therefore, they impose such restrictions on media,' Zwak said. He said that the Taliban 'show no tolerance to dissidents and any criticism of their government.' Rights watchdogs reported that the human rights situation has deteriorated under the Taliban. Heather Barr, the women's rights associate director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA that the Taliban’s order would have a 'significant impact' on the coverage of human rights. How can media outlets 'talk about human rights if they are not allowed to depict human beings in their coverage?' said Barr. She said the law is of concern to women’s rights activists in Afghanistan who use media to make their voices heard. 'Perhaps one of the goals of this new Taliban’s order is to block them from being able to express themselves and to share their experiences with each other through the media and with the world more broadly,' Barr said. Women in Afghanistan live under repressive measures. They are barred from getting secondary and university education, working with government and non-government organizations, and going to public places, such as parks, gyms, and beauty salons. Hamid Obaidi, head of the Germany-based Afghanistan Journalists Support Organization, told VOA that banning media from showing living things is the continuation of the Taliban’s 'repressive measures against press freedom' in the past three years. He said that the implementation of the law would mean the closure of all the TV stations in the country. But, he said, the Taliban’s calculation that it can 'beat media into submission' is wrong. He said Afghan journalists and media outlets will continue to function from exile, and technology will help people inside Afghanistan to connect. 'The Taliban think that they can silence Afghan voices, but it is not possible,' he added.

Threat of famine persists in Gaza, experts warn	UNITED NATIONS — A United Nations-backed food security report warned Thursday that most of the residents of the Gaza Strip will face emergency levels of hunger in the coming months and that the threat of famine persists as aid dwindles and winter approaches. 'Famine looms. This is intolerable,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on social media platform X. He said crossing points must open immediately, bureaucratic impediments must be removed, and law and order restored so U.N. agencies can deliver aid. The updated report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, projects that over the coming months 345,000 Palestinians will face Catastrophic or Phase 5 level of hunger. Another 876,000 people, or 41% of the population, will be a step behind them in Phase 4 — Emergency level. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk told reporters that the report’s conclusions are 'beyond terrifying.' 'They show that the number of people at catastrophic levels of hunger is expected to double in the coming months, and the risk of famine persists across the whole of Gaza,' he said at a news conference in New York. 'The world cannot let this happen.' He said the hunger crisis is 'principally the consequence of decisions made by the Israeli authorities' and warned that starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime. 'As the occupying power, Israel has the specific obligation under IHL [international humanitarian law] to bring into Gaza the necessary foodstuffs, medical supplies and other articles, and to facilitate humanitarian relief by all means at its disposal,' Türk said. Overall, the IPC said 91% of Gazans — or nearly 2 million Palestinians — will face acute food insecurity. Although less populated, Rafah and the northern governorates will likely face more severe acute food insecurity. The IPC said that a temporary surge of humanitarian assistance and commercial supplies between May and August helped alleviate acute food insecurity and malnutrition conditions in Gaza, but September saw the lowest volume of commercial and humanitarian supplies entering the enclave since March. 'This sharp decline will profoundly limit food availability and the ability of families to feed themselves and access services in the next few months,' the IPC said. 'The upcoming winter season is expected to bring colder temperatures along with rain and potential flooding. Seasonal diseases and increasingly limited access to water and health services are likely to worsen acute malnutrition, especially in densely populated areas, where the risk of epidemics is already high.' Humanitarian assistance into Gaza has not reached the scale or consistency that the United Nations has been calling for throughout the yearlong conflict. On Wednesday, the acting humanitarian chief told a Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation that no food aid entered northern Gaza for the first two weeks of October and that all essential supplies are running out. 'Throughout Gaza, less than a third of the 286 humanitarian missions coordinated with Israeli authorities in the first two weeks of October were facilitated without major incidents or delays,' Joyce Msuya said. 'Every time a mission is impeded, the lives of people in need and humanitarians on the ground are put at even greater risk.' The U.N. has reported similar clearance problems for months. But it also acknowledges that it faces distribution challenges because of lawlessness and badly damaged roads, in addition to Israeli impediments, including making convoys wait for hours until it is dark and unsafe to proceed in a war zone. Israel disputes that it impedes or restricts aid deliveries into Gaza and largely blames Hamas. 'The real problem is Hamas,' Ambassador Danny Danon told the same meeting. 'The terrorist organization steals, stores and sells the aid that enters the Gaza Strip and uses it to feed its terrorist machine and not to feed Gazans.' The World Food Program said Thursday that without safe and sustained access, it cannot deliver assistance at the required scale. It called again for a cease-fire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/threat-of-famine-persists-in-gaza-experts-warn/7826335.html	2024-10-17T10:43:48-07:00

Who is Yahyar Sinwar?	Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli military operation, was Israel’s most wanted man. The chief architect of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, Sinwar was named leader of Hamas following the August assassination of then-leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Iran blamed Israel for Haniyeh’s killing. Sinwar, 61, was born in a refugee camp in the Gaza town in Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987, and eventually led the group's security arm, which sought to purge it of Israeli spies. Israel arrested him in the late 1980s. He admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname 'The Butcher of Khan Younis.' Israel sentenced him to four life terms for an array of offenses, including the killing of two Israeli soldiers. Sinwar survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors and was released from prison in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sinwar was part of a prisoner swap for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. Upon his return to Gaza, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. The U.S. State Department designated him as a 'global terrorist' in 2015. He was widely believed to be linked to the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle. Sinwar headed Hamas operations in Gaza, working with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies in the Middle East while also building the group's military capabilities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-is-yahyar-sinwar/7826332.html	2024-10-17T10:29:59-07:00	
US sanctions Chinese entities for building, shipping Russian Garpiya drones used in Ukraine	washington — The United States on Thursday announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese and Russian entities for their role in designing, building and shipping attack drones that have resulted in mass casualties in Ukraine. The sanctions target two Chinese entities, Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Co., Ltd., and Redlepus Vector Industry Shenzhen Co Ltd (Redlepus), Russian entity TSK Vektor and TSK Vektor’s General Director Artem Mikhailovich Yamshchikov. A senior administration official told reporters Thursday that the entities were involved in developing the Russian Garpiya series long-range attack drones, producing them in China and shipping them directly to Russia. 'The Garpiya, designed and produced in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in collaboration with Russian defense firms, has been used to destroy critical infrastructure and has resulted in mass casualties,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement. 'Today’s action is part of our continued effort to disrupt attempts by PRC-based and Russia-based entities and individuals to support Russia’s acquisition of advanced weapons technology and components. We will continue to impose costs on those who provide support to Russia’s military-industrial base.' The senior administration official said the U.S. has warned Beijing in the past about the network, contradicting Chinese statements that they are not aware of such networks. Two Chinese firms are directly 'involved in producing and shipping things that are unmistakably part of Russia's war against Ukraine and are going unmistakably to an actor that the West has already identified and sanctioned as being part of the Russian military industrial base,' said the official. Since 2022, the U.S. has sanctioned close to 100 entities based in China and Hong Kong. The majority of them are part of the supply chain of dual-use items – components or goods that can be converted by Russia into military items that are then being deployed against Ukraine. However, Thursday’s sanctions were the first to hit Chinese entities 'directly developing and producing complete weapons systems in partnership with Russian firms.' Also Thursday, the U.K. announced its largest package of sanctions against Russia’s 'shadow fleet of oil tankers' – ships that supposedly knowingly operate in defiance of Western sanctions. London said 18 more shadow fleet ships will be barred from U.K. ports, bringing the total number of oil tankers sanctioned to 43. Sanctions working In response to VOA’s question, the official said that Western sanctions are working. 'This is having a direct impact on their economy. It's having a direct impact on their ability to get war material. It's having a direct impact on the quality of goods that they are achieving,' the official said. A second senior administration official said Moscow is feeling 'unprecedented external pressure' on its trade and investment projects with China. Growing trade ties between the two countries, though, indicate 'they are continuing to innovate and circumvent which is why we are also moving out on sanctions and other tools.' China says it is not providing weapons for Russia. Beijing maintains it handles its export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and applies strict controls on drone exports. The sanctioned companies' transactions are 'incompatible' with Beijing’s statements, the second official said. 'If China is serious about that commitment, we are asking them to take action to shut down this network.' Beijing has said in the past it 'firmly opposes unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that have no basis in international law or authorization of the U.N. Security Council.' Every month, Beijing exports to Russia more than $300 million of those so-called dual-use items that have both commercial and military applications, according to an analysis of Chinese customs data by the Carnegie Endowment think tank. Ties have grown between Moscow and Beijing. On Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced plans for expanded cooperation during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, summit in Islamabad, Pakistan. The SCO was founded by Russia and China in 2001 to counter Western alliances.

FBI arrests suspect in hacking of US SEC's account on platform X	WASHINGTON — An Alabama man was arrested on Thursday over criminal charges that he hacked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's X account earlier this year, in an action that caused bitcoin's value to spike, federal prosecutors announced. In January, a hacker posted false news about a widely anticipated announcement the SEC was expected to make about bitcoin, shocking the market and sending the cryptocurrency's price spiking. The post on @SECGov said the securities regulator had approved exchange-traded funds to hold bitcoin. The SEC deleted the post shortly after it appeared. Eric Council Jr., 25, of Athens, Alabama, was arrested on Thursday morning in connection with the hack, the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia said in a statement on Thursday. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Thursday's arrest. The agency previously said it was the victim of 'SIM swapping,' a technique used by fraudsters to seize control of telephone lines, when its account on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, was hacked earlier in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-arrests-suspect-in-hacking-of-us-sec-s-account-on-platform-x/7826271.html	2024-10-17T09:47:06-07:00

Battleground state starts early in-person voting while recovering from Helene	ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA — Early in-person voting began statewide Thursday in the presidential battleground of North Carolina, including in mountainous areas where thousands of potential voters still lack power and clean running water after Hurricane Helene's epic flooding. More than 400 locations in all 100 counties were slated to open for the 17-day early vote period, said State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell. Only four of 80 sites in the 25 western counties hardest hit by the storm weren't going to open. Helene's arrival three weeks ago in the U.S. Southeast decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia and killed at least 246 people, with a little over half of the storm-related deaths in North Carolina. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. At the South Buncombe Library in Asheville, a city devastated by the storm, about 60 people — most bundled up in jackets, hats and gloves for the chilly weather — lined up around the building before the polls opened at 9 a.m. They included 77-year-old Joyce Rich, who said Helene made early voting more urgent for her. Rich said while her house was largely spared by the storm, she and her husband still need to do some work on it. Meanwhile, family members who don't have power or water access are coming over to take showers. 'We decided, let's just get it finished,' Rich said. 'You never know what's going to happen.' Another voter at the library, 33-year-old Jarred Teague, said it was important to show up to vote early, in part because 'democracy itself seems to be on the line' during this election. Early in-person voting, which continues through November 2, is very popular in North Carolina. More than 3.6 million ballots — 65% of all cast ballots — were cast this way in the 2020 general election. In the 2016 election, 62% of all cast ballots were cast during early in-person voting. Absentee voting in North Carolina began a few weeks ago, with over 67,000 completed ballots turned in so far, election officials said. People displaced by Helene are being allowed to drop off their absentee ballot at any early voting site in the state. The importance of early voting wasn't lost upon the presidential campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. On Thursday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz was expected to campaign in Winston-Salem and Durham, where he was to be joined by former President Bill Clinton. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley were expected to appear on the 'Team Trump Bus Tour' when it resumes Thursday in Rutherford County, which was among the hardest-hit areas. The North Carolina ballot also includes races for governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions. All U.S. House of Representatives and state General Assembly seats are up for reelection. County election boards have received flexibility to modify early voting sites, including locations and their daily hours. In Buncombe County, 10 of the 14 planned early voting sites will be open. In Watauga County, home to Boone and Appalachian State University, the board adjusted early voting hours to avoid evening travel for voters and poll workers. They also expanded weekend voting options. Watauga elections Director Matt Snyder said Wednesday having all six sites ready for Thursday was a feat his office didn't expect in Helene's immediate aftermath. But election officials have been working weekends to get prepared. 'It's exhausting,' Snyder said. 'It's 16-hour days ... but everybody seems to pitch in.' Officials in the 25 counties affected by the storm were still evaluating Election Day polling locations, with the 'vast majority' expected to be available to voters, Brinson Bell said. This is the first presidential general election for which North Carolina voters must show photo identification.

Business, communication nosedive as Chad internet blackout enters 3rd day	Yaounde, Cameroon — Civilians in Chad say many businesses are at a standstill since an internet outage that began Tuesday morning. Kaimoui Fabrice, a student in the University of N'djamena, said he has not been able to carry out online research or talk with his supervisor at the University of Lyon in France since the outage began. He spoke to VOA on Thursday via telephone from Chad's capital, saying he is surprised by the government’s indifference and failure to find a solution in the days since October 15 when civilians started complaining. He added that the internet outage has paralyzed businesses in Chad. Kaimoui said students are angry because the internet blackout deprives them of their right to education and deprives civilians of their rights to freedom of information and expression. Allamaye Halina, Chad's prime minister, said he is surprised that some civilians think the blackout was ordered by the government for security reasons. He denied those allegations, adding that many government offices have also been unable to render services to users because of the outage. He said Chad's government regrets that the shutdown has led to a nosedive in business transactions, and has negatively impacted the lives of civilians. Halina told state TV on Thursday that Chad's government has ordered the country’s minister of communication to meet with SAFITEL and SOTEL, the companies that manage Chad’s fiber-optic networks, to make sure connection is reestablished as soon as possible. Boukar Michel, Chad’s minister of communication and digital economy, said government officials in neighboring Cameroon, which connects Chad to the internet, have informed him that emergency repairs are ongoing on broken fiber-optic cables around Adamawa, an administrative unit in Cameroon that shares a boundary with Chad. He said the repair work has yet to be completed because floods have made access to the area difficult. Boukar said he is unhappy with internet suppliers for not informing users through text messages and radio announcements that the interruption was caused by broken cables, not ordered by the government as many civilians believe. Cameroon said its technicians are deployed to repair the cables, but has not said when connections will be reestablished. In the meantime, many Chadians said they believe the internet blackout is due to political tensions ahead of the December 29 local and parliamentary elections. Last week, Succes Masra, president of the Transformers, Chad's main opposition party, called for elections to be pushed back to 2025. Masra said ongoing floods that have killed at least 600 people and displaced about 2 million make it impossible for elections to be held in December. The government says the elections must take place as planned, and denies claims that it ordered an internet shutdown to stop youths from using social media to mobilize their peers as the election date nears. In February, before Chad's May 6 presidential polls, Chad's government interrupted connectivity, saying it acted in response to a deadly attack on the country’s internal security agency. In June, after the opposition contested the election victory of President General Mahamat Idriss Deby, connectivity was disrupted again and only civilians with Starlink equipment maintained access to the internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/business-communication-nosedive-as-chad-internet-blackout-enters-3rd-day/7826023.html	2024-10-17T07:56:54-07:00	
Kenya's deputy president in hospital, fails to show for impeachment trial	Nairobi — Kenya's embattled Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua is reportedly at the hospital on the day he was scheduled to testify at his own impeachment trial. Proceedings were suspended but would resume around 5pm local time according to the speaker of the Senate Amason Kingi. Kingi told the chamber he expects the deputy president to take the stand because he says this is 'a time bound process… it is so ordered.' Gachagua has pleaded not guilty to all allegations against him including corruption, inciting ethnic divisions and support for anti-government protests that saw demonstrators storm the country's parliament. He could be the first sitting deputy president impeached in Kenya. The case highlights the friction between him and President William Ruto — something that Ruto once vowed to avoid after his past troubled relationship as deputy to Kenya's previous president, Uhuru Kenyatta. Gachagua has said he believes the impeachment process has Ruto's blessing, and has asked legislators to make their decision 'without intimidation and coercion.' The tensions risk introducing more uncertainty for investors and others in East Africa's commercial hub. Court rulings this week allowed the parliament and senate to proceed with the impeachment debate, despite concerns over irregularities raised by the deputy president's lawyers. The impeachment motion was approved in parliament last week and forwarded to the senate. Gachagua's legal team will have Wednesday and Thursday to cross-examine witnesses, and the senate will vote Thursday evening. The senate requires a two-thirds majority to approve the impeachment motion. Under the Kenyan Constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. Kenya's president has yet to publicly comment on the impeachment process. Early in his presidency, he said he wouldn't publicly humiliate his deputy. Ruto, who came to office claiming to represent Kenya's poorest citizens, has faced widespread criticism for his efforts to raise taxes in an effort to find ways to pay off foreign creditors. But the public opposition led him to shake up his cabinet and back off certain proposals. VOA’s Mariama Diallo contributed to this report from Nairobi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-deputy-president-in-hospital-fails-to-show-for-impeachment-trial/7826000.html	2024-10-17T07:32:36-07:00	
Death of ex-One Direction member Liam Payne at 31 shocks fans around the world	Buenos Aires, Argentina — The death of Liam Payne, who shot to stardom as a member of British boy band One Direction and grappled with intense global fame while still in his teens, sent shockwaves across the world Thursday as Argentine investigators continued their investigation at the scene. Fans, music-industry figures and fellow musicians paid tribute to Payne, 31, who died after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina. As fans and media bombarded the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, the forensics unit worked inside on Thursday collecting evidence. The Buenos Aires police said they found Payne's hotel room 'in complete disarray,' with packs of clonazepam, a central nervous system depressant, as well as energy supplements and other over-the-counter drugs strewn about and 'various items broken.' They added that a whiskey bottle, lighter and cellphone were retrieved from the internal hotel courtyard where Payne's body was found. The day before, police said that Payne 'had jumped from the balcony of his room,' without elaborating on how they came to that conclusion. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the incident, as the investigation is ongoing. The medical examiner's office said it was conducting an autopsy. Police said they had rushed to the hotel Wednesday in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time that had warned of an 'aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.' A hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call recording obtained by The Associated Press saying the hotel has 'a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... He's destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please.' The manager's voice becomes more anxious as the call goes on, noting the room has a balcony. Payne was known as the tousle-headed, sensible one of the quintet that went from a TV talent show to a pop phenomenon with a huge international following of swooning fans. In recent years he had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, who performed with One Direction in 2014, said he was 'shocked and saddened.' 'God bless Liam, thinking of all his loved ones. He will be dearly missed,' Wood wrote on X. Paris Hilton also sent condolences on X, saying the news was 'so upsetting.' The Backstreet Boys said in a social media post that their hearts go out to 'Directioners around the world.' Dozens of One Direction fans flocked to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside, where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen leaving the building, from where Payne's body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew. 'I didn't think he was going to die so young,' 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed after each auditioned for the British singing competition 'The X Factor' in 2010, two years after Payne's first attempt to get on the show. Aged 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublé's version of 'Cry Me a River,' appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audience's cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as a solo act, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands ever — even though they lost the competition. Each member had his own persona, with Payne — who hailed from Wolverhampton in England's West Midlands region — known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits including 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Night Changes' and 'Story of My Life.' Payne had prominent solos on songs including 'Stole My Heart' and 'Change Your Ticket,' co-writing several of the band's hits. One Direction had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as 'Directioners,' many of them teen girls. 'I've always loved One Direction since I was little,' said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Payne's hotel. 'To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me.' With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to life in the public eye. 'I don't think you can ever deal with that. It's all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do,' he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. One Direction announced an indefinite 'hiatus' in 2016, and Payne — like each of his erstwhile bandmates — pursued a solo career, shifting toward EDM and hip-hop. While Styles became a huge solo star, the others had more modest success. Payne's 2017 single 'Strip That Down,' featuring Quavo, reached the Billboard Top 10, and stayed on the charts for several months. He put out an album 'LP1' in 2019, and his last release — a single called 'Teardrops' — was released in March. In 2020, to mark the 10th anniversary of One Direction, Payne shared a screenshot of a text message he sent to his father on the day he joined the group, which read: 'I'm in a boyband.' 'What a journey … I had no idea what we were in for when I sent this text to my dad years ago at this exact time the band was formed,' he wrote. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl, who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an 'X Factor' judge during One Direction's season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-of-ex-one-direction-member-liam-payne-at-31-shocks-fans-around-the-world/7825964.html	2024-10-17T07:16:11-07:00

UK foreign minister to visit China to rebuild damaged ties	London/Beijing — British Foreign Secretary David Lammy will visit China on a two-day visit starting on Friday in a bid to improve relations between the two countries after years of tensions over security concerns and alleged human rights abuses. Lammy will hold talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing before visiting Shanghai to meet British businesses operating in China, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Thursday. 'It's all about bringing a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the U.K.'s position on China,' the spokesperson told reporters, adding that Britain was prepared to challenge China where needed but also identify areas for co-operation. Mao Ning, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said the talks would focus on improving cooperation in various fields. It will be only the second visit by a British foreign minister in six years after Lammy's Conservative predecessor James Cleverly’s trip last year. Before that, there had been a five-year gap in a visit to China by a British foreign minister. Labour, who won a landslide election victory in July, is seeking to stabilize relations with Beijing after clashes over human rights, Hong Kong, and allegations of Chinese espionage. Starmer told President Xi Jinping in the first conversation between the two in August that he wanted Britain and China to pursue closer economic ties while being free to talk frankly about their disagreements. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng and British finance minister Rachel Reeves last month discussed how they can work together to boost economic growth. Following the exchange, Beijing said it was willing to resume the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue - an annual forum for talks on trade, investment and other economic issues, which had not taken place since 2019. Under the previous Conservative government, Britain expressed concern about China’s curbing of civil freedoms in Hong Kong, which was under British control until 1997, and its treatment of people in its western Xinjiang region. Britain and China also traded accusations over perceived spying. China is Britain's sixth-largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of total trade, British government figures show.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-foreign-minister-to-visit-china-to-rebuild-damaged-ties/7825909.html	2024-10-17T06:32:32-07:00

European Central Bank cuts main interest rate a quarter-point to 3.25% as inflation fades	The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, cut borrowing costs once again on Thursday after figures showed inflation across the bloc falling to its lowest level in more than three years and economic growth waning. The bank's rate-setting council lowered its benchmark rate from 3.5% to 3.25% at a meeting in Llubljana, Slovenia, rather than its usual Frankfurt, Germany, headquarters. The rate cut is its third since June and shows optimism among rate-setters over the path of inflation. Inflation sank to 1.8% in September, the first time in three years that it has been below the ECB's target rate of 2%. Inflation has been falling more than anticipated — in September, it was down at 1.8%, the first time it has been below the ECB's target of 2% in more than three years — and analysts think the bank will lower rates in December, too. Mounting evidence that the eurozone is barely growing — just 0.3% in the second-quarter — has only accentuated the view that ECB President Christine Lagarde will not seek to dislodge that expectation. 'The trends in the real economy and inflation support the case for lower rates,' said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. One reason why inflation has fallen around the world is that central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues built up and then because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine which pushed up energy costs. The ECB, which was created in 1999 when the euro currency was born, started raising interest rates in the summer of 2021, taking them up to a record high of 4% in Sept. 2023 to get a grip on inflation by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow, but that has come at a cost by weighing on growth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-central-bank-cuts-main-interest-rate-a-quarter-point-to-3-25-as-inflation-fades/7825869.html	2024-10-17T05:44:19-07:00	
Panel looking into Trump assassination attempt says Secret Service needs 'fundamental reform'	An independent panel investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots. The review also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing 'more with less.' The 52-page report issued Thursday took the Secret Service to task for specific problems leading up to the July 13 rally in Butler as a well as deeper one within the agency's culture. It recommended bringing in new, outside leadership and refocusing on its protective mission. 'The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,' the authors wrote Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of the Homeland Security Department, the Secret Services' parent agency, in a letter accompanying their report. 'Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.' One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Michael Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency. The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body. A look at the report's key findings and recommendations: Poor communications, no plan for key buildings The panel echoed previous reports that have zeroed in on the failure to secure the building near the rally that had a clear line of site to where Trump was speaking and the multiple communications problems that hindered the ability of the Secret Service and local and state law enforcement to talk to each other. 'The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,' the report said. The panel faulted the planning between Secret Service and the local law enforcement, and said the Secret Service failed to ask about what was being done to secure the building: 'Relying on a general understanding that 'the locals have that area covered' is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure.' The panel also cited the fact that there were two separated command posts at the Butler rally: one with various local law enforcement and another with the Secret Service: 'This created, at the highest level, a structural divide in the flow of communications.' There were other communications problems. The Secret Service had to switch radio channels because radio traffic of agents protecting first lady Jill Biden at an event in Pittsburgh was popping up on the channels of agents covering the Butler rally. The panel also noted that all the law enforcement personnel on the ground were using a 'chaotic mixture' of radio, cell phone, text, and e-mail throughout the day to communicate. Also the panel said it was unclear who had ultimate command that day. Cultural issues within the agency The report delved into the agency's culture and painted a picture of an agency struggling to think critically about how it carries out its mission, especially when it comes to protecting Trump. The panel said agency personnel operated under the assumption that they effectively had to 'do more with less.' The report said the additional security measures taken to protect Trump after the Butler shooting should have been taken before. 'To be clear, the Panel did not identify any nefarious or malicious intent behind this phenomenon, but rather an overreliance on assigning personnel based on categories (former, candidate, nominee) instead of an individualized assessment of risk,' the panel wrote. The panel also noted the 'back-and-forth' between the Trump security detail and Secret Service headquarters regarding how many people were needed to protect him. The panel also faulted some of the senior-level staff who were involved in the rally for what they called a 'lack of ownership.' In one example, the panel said a senior agent on site who was tasked with coordinating communications didn't walk around the rally site ahead of timen and did not brief the state police counterpart before the rally about how communications would be managed. It cited the relative inexperience of two specific agents who played a role in security for the July 13 rally. One was the site agent from Trump's detail whose job it was to coordinate with the Pittsburgh field office on security planning for the rally. The panel said the agent graduated from the Secret Service academy in 2020, and had only been on the Trump detail since 2023. Before the Butler rally the agent had only done 'minimal previous site advance work or site security planning.' Another agent assigned to operate a drone detection system had only used the technology at two prior events. What did the panel recommend? Having a unified command post at all large events where Secret Service and other law enforcement representatives are all physically in the same place; overhead surveillance for all outdoor events; security plans must include a way to mitigate line of site concerns out to 1,000 yards and who's in charge at the event; and more training on how to get protectees out of dangerous scenarios. The panel said the agency also needs new, outside leadership and a renewed focus on its core protective mission while expressing skepticism that the agency should continue with the investigations it currently conducts. While the Secret Service is well known for what it does to protect presidents and other dignitaries, it also investigates financial crimes. 'In the Panel's opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,' the report said. The panel members were Mark Filip, deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush; David Mitchell, who served in numerous state and local law enforcement roles in Maryland and Delaware; Janet Napolitano, homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama; and Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panel-looking-into-trump-assassination-attempt-says-secret-service-needs-fundamental-reform-/7825865.html	2024-10-17T05:40:58-07:00	
US prosecutors see rising threat of AI-generated child sex abuse imagery	U.S. federal prosecutors are stepping up their pursuit of suspects who use artificial intelligence tools to manipulate or create child sex abuse images, as law enforcement fears the technology could spur a flood of illicit material. The U.S. Justice Department has brought two criminal cases this year against defendants accused of using generative AI systems, which create text or images in response to user prompts, to produce explicit images of children. 'There's more to come,' said James Silver, the chief of the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, predicting further similar cases. 'What we're concerned about is the normalization of this,' Silver said in an interview. 'AI makes it easier to generate these kinds of images, and the more that are out there, the more normalized this becomes. That's something that we really want to stymie and get in front of.' The rise of generative AI has sparked concerns at the Justice Department that the rapidly advancing technology will be used to carry out cyberattacks, boost the sophistication of cryptocurrency scammers and undermine election security. Child sex abuse cases mark some of the first times that prosecutors are trying to apply existing U.S. laws to alleged crimes involving AI, and even successful convictions could face appeals as courts weigh how the new technology may alter the legal landscape around child exploitation. Prosecutors and child safety advocates say generative AI systems can allow offenders to morph and sexualize ordinary photos of children and warn that a proliferation of AI-produced material will make it harder for law enforcement to identify and locate real victims of abuse. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit group that collects tips about online child exploitation, receives an average of about 450 reports each month related to generative AI, according to Yiota Souras, the group's chief legal officer. That's a fraction of the average of 3 million monthly reports of overall online child exploitation the group received last year. Untested ground Cases involving AI-generated sex abuse imagery are likely to tread new legal ground, particularly when an identifiable child is not depicted. Silver said in those instances, prosecutors can charge obscenity offenses when child pornography laws do not apply. Prosecutors indicted Steven Anderegg, a software engineer from Wisconsin, in May on charges including transferring obscene material. Anderegg is accused of using Stable Diffusion, a popular text-to-image AI model, to generate images of young children engaged in sexually explicit conduct and sharing some of those images with a 15-year-old boy, according to court documents. Anderegg has pleaded not guilty and is seeking to dismiss the charges by arguing that they violate his rights under the U.S. Constitution, court documents show. He has been released from custody while awaiting trial. His attorney was not available for comment. Stability AI, the maker of Stable Diffusion, said the case involved a version of the AI model that was released before the company took over the development of Stable Diffusion. The company said it has made investments to prevent 'the misuse of AI for the production of harmful content.' Federal prosecutors also charged a U.S. Army soldier with child pornography offenses in part for allegedly using AI chatbots to morph innocent photos of children he knew to generate violent sexual abuse imagery, court documents show. The defendant, Seth Herrera, pleaded not guilty and has been ordered held in jail to await trial. Herrera's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Legal experts said that while sexually explicit depictions of actual children are covered under child pornography laws, the landscape around obscenity and purely AI-generated imagery is less clear. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 struck down as unconstitutional a federal law that criminalized any depiction, including computer-generated imagery, appearing to show minors engaged in sexual activity. 'These prosecutions will be hard if the government is relying on the moral repulsiveness alone to carry the day,' said Jane Bambauer, a law professor at the University of Florida who studies AI and its impact on privacy and law enforcement. Federal prosecutors have secured convictions in recent years against defendants who possessed sexually explicit images of children that also qualified as obscene under the law. Advocates are also focusing on preventing AI systems from generating abusive material. Two nonprofit advocacy groups, Thorn and All Tech Is Human, secured commitments in April from some of the largest players in AI including Alphabet's Google, Amazon.com, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, OpenAI and Stability AI to avoid training their models on child sex abuse imagery and to monitor their platforms to prevent its creation and spread. 'I don't want to paint this as a future problem, because it's not. It's happening now,' said Rebecca Portnoff, Thorn's director of data science. 'As far as whether it's a future problem that will get completely out of control, I still have hope that we can act in this window of opportunity to prevent that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-prosecutors-see-rising-threat-of-ai-generated-child-sex-abuse-imagery/7825808.html	2024-10-17T04:43:15-07:00

At least 18 die in India's Bihar state after drinking tainted liquor	At least 18 people have died and several more are in a hospital after consuming tainted liquor in India's eastern state of Bihar, a senior government official said Thursday. The death toll is likely to rise, said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media about the matter. Local police have arrested 22 people for their alleged involvement in the sale of tainted liquor in the state, which banned the sale and purchase of liquor in 2016. Deaths from illegally produced alcohol, known locally as 'hooch' or 'country liquor,' are a regular occurrence in India, where many cannot afford branded spirits. News agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake, showed a crying mother whose only son died after consuming the tainted liquor. 'He started vomiting and lost his eyesight,’’ she said. ‘’He has left behind his wife and son. We don't know what to do.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-18-die-in-india-s-bihar-state-after-drinking-tainted-liquor-/7825757.html	2024-10-17T03:49:21-07:00	
Watchdog: 'Serious questions' over Meta's handling of anti-immigrant posts	Meta's independent content watchdog said Thursday there were 'serious questions' about how the social media giant deals with anti-immigrant content, particularly in Europe. The Oversight Board, established by Meta in 2020 and sometimes called its 'supreme court,' launched a probe after seeing a 'significant number' of appeals over anti-immigrant content. The board has chosen two symbolic cases -- one from Germany and the other from Poland -- to assess whether Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is following human rights law and its own policies on hate speech. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, co-chair of the board and a former Danish prime minister, said it was 'critical' to get the balance right between free speech and protection of vulnerable groups. 'The high number of appeals we get on immigration-related content from across the EU tells us there are serious questions to ask about how the company handles issues related to this, including the use of coded speech,' she said in a statement. The first piece of content to be assessed by the board was posted in May on a Facebook page claiming to be the official account of Poland's far-right Confederation party. An image depicts Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk looking through a peephole with a black man approaching him from behind, accompanied by text suggesting his government would allow immigration to surge. Meta rejected an appeal from a user to take down the post despite the text including a word considered by some as a racial slur. In the other case, an apparently AI-generated image was posted on a German Facebook page showing a blond-haired blue-eyed woman, a German flag and a stop sign. The accompanying text likens immigrants to 'gang rape specialists.' A user complained but Meta decided to not to remove the post. 'The board selected these cases to address the significant number of appeals, especially from Europe, against content that shares views on immigration in ways that may be harmful towards immigrants,' the watchdog said in a statement. The board said it wanted to hear from the public and would spend 'the next few weeks' discussing the issue before publishing its decision. Decisions by the board, funded by a trust set up by Meta, are not binding, though the company has promised to follow its rulings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/watchdog-serious-questions-over-meta-s-handling-of-anti-immigrant-posts/7825746.html	2024-10-17T03:34:05-07:00	
Germany outlines measures to strengthen domestic wind industry	Germany plans to introduce measures aimed at boosting its domestic wind industry, the economy ministry said on Thursday, amid concerns from European governments and companies over Chinese firms gaining momentum on the continent. The measures will focus on improving cybersecurity, reducing dependency for critical components like permanent magnets, and ensuring fair competition in global markets, the ministry said following a meeting with unnamed European wind turbine manufacturers and suppliers in Berlin, without giving further details or a time frame. China accounts for about 60% of global rare earth mine production, but its share jumps to 90% of processed rare earths and magnet output. 'We must continue improving conditions to keep this industry competitive and ensure future value creation within Germany and Europe. These measures are a crucial step,' Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a statement. The plan will also address securing financing for increased production and adjusting public funding mechanisms to prevent market distortion. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for further details. Tensions are high between Beijing and the European Union, the world's two largest wind markets. The European Commission launched an investigation in April into whether Chinese companies are benefiting from unfair subsidies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-outlines-measures-to-strengthen-domestic-wind-industry-/7825729.html	2024-10-17T03:16:05-07:00	
Israel says it killed a Hezbollah commander in Lebanon strike	Israel’s military said Thursday it killed a Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, while also announcing a new round of evacuation orders in the Bekaa Valley. The Israel Defense Forces identified the commander killed as Hussein Awada and said he was responsible for firing projectiles across the border into Israel. Israel has issued multiple rounds of evacuation orders for parts of Lebanon, saying people need to get out of those areas due to their proximity to Hezbollah militant sites. The orders typically precede Israeli airstrikes. The latest orders Thursday included the Saraaine, Tamnine and Safri areas. Lebanon’s health ministry said Israeli airstrikes Wednesday killed 16 people in the southern town of Nabatieh, including its mayor, and wounded more than 50. Lebanese officials denounced the attack on the provincial capital, contending it was proof that Israel's campaign against the Hezbollah armed group was now shifting to target the Lebanese state. Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Israel 'intentionally targeted a meeting of the municipal council to discuss the city's service and relief situation' to aid people displaced by the Israeli campaign. But Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, on a visit to northern Israel near the border with Lebanon, said Israel would not halt its assault on Hezbollah to allow negotiations. The Israeli military said it attacked dozens of Hezbollah targets in the Nabatieh area. U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said the Israeli attack 'follows other incidents in which civilians and civilian infrastructure have been targeted across Lebanon,' and that 'civilian suffering is reaching unprecedented heights.' 'It is time for all concerned actors to immediately cease their fire and open the door to diplomatic solutions capable of realizing the needs of citizens and advancing regional stability,' Hennis-Plasschaert said in a statement. Asked by a reporter about the strike, U.N. Ambassador to Israel Danny Danon said, 'We target Hezbollah bases.' He said he would look into the specific incident. Israeli forces also carried out airstrikes Wednesday on Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending plumes of smoke rising from at least two neighborhoods. Israel also reported more than 50 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Wednesday, while Hezbollah said it launched missiles at an area in northern Israel. Aid to Gazans At the United Nations Security Council Wednesday, diplomats were given a grim picture of the humanitarian situation, particularly in the north, where Israel has been stepping up its military activity this month. 'No food aid entered northern Gaza from October 2 to October 15, when a trickle was allowed in, and all essential supplies for survival are running out,' said acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya. 'During the first two weeks of October, just one out of 54 coordinated movements to the north via the Al Rashid checkpoint was facilitated by Israeli authorities, while another four were impeded but eventually accomplished,' she said. 'Eighty-five percent of the movements were denied, and the rest were impeded or canceled, due to security or logistical issues.' Council members condemned the humanitarian situation and Israeli military evacuation orders. Several said it is time for the council to consider all its 'tools' to enforce its existing resolutions -- diplomatic speak for sanctions. The session came days after the United States demanded that Israel boost its humanitarian aid to famished Palestinians in Gaza within the next month or face the possibility that Washington would cut its military aid supporting Israel's year-long war against Hamas militants. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,400 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-killed-a-hezbollah-commander-in-lebanon-strike/7825711.html	2024-10-17T02:58:59-07:00	
Bangladesh court issues arrest warrant for ex-prime minister in protester deaths	DHAKA, Bangladesh — A special court in Bangladesh issued arrest warrants Thursday for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and 45 others, including her close aides, on charges of crimes against humanity during a student-led uprising in July and August that forced her to flee the country, a prosecutor said. Prosecutor B.M. Sultan Mahmud said the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, issued the arrest warrants in response to two petitions submitted by the prosecution. He said the head of the tribunal, Golam Mortuza Majumdar, issued the orders in the presence of other judges. 'The tribunal first accepted our petition that involved Sheikh Hasina alone. Then we moved our second petition against 45 people that involved her close aides and others for the crimes against humanity. It was also accepted by the tribunal,' he said by phone. Hasina fled the country to India on August 5 after weeks of violent protests over government job quotas in which hundreds of people died. Prosecutors said in the petitions that Hasina, her close aides and security agencies were responsible for killing the protesters and others. It is not clear if India will respond to any request from Bangladesh for Hasina's extradition under a mutual treaty. The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Muhammad Tajul Islam, earlier said they would seek help from Interpol, if necessary, to get Hasina back. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ex-prime-minister-in-protester-deaths/7825696.html	2024-10-17T02:19:47-07:00	
Gaza unemployment surges to 80% as economy collapses, UN agency says	ZURICH — Unemployment in Gaza has soared to nearly 80% since the Israel-Hamas war erupted, with the devastated enclave's economy in almost total collapse, the International Labour Organization said Thursday. Economic output has shrunk by 85% since the conflict with Israel began a year ago, plunging almost the entire 2.3 million population into poverty, the United Nations agency said. The conflict has caused 'unprecedented and wide-ranging devastation on the labour market and the wider economy across the Occupied Palestinian Territory,' the ILO said, referring to Gaza and the West Bank. In the West Bank, the unemployment rate averaged 34.9% between October 2023 and the end of September 2024, while its economy has contracted by 21.7% compared with the previous 12 months, the ILO said. Before the crisis, the unemployment rate in Gaza was 45.3% and 14% in the West Bank, according to the Geneva-based organization. Gazans either lost their jobs entirely or picked up informal and irregular work 'primarily centred on the provision of essential goods and services,' the ILO said. Israel launched its offensive after Hamas-led gunmen attacked on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's campaign in response has killed more than 42,000 people, according to Gaza's health authorities. Two-thirds of Gaza's pre-war structures -- more than 163,000 buildings -- have been damaged or flattened, according to U.N. satellite data. Israel says its operations are aimed at rooting out Hamas militants hiding in tunnels and among Gaza's civilian population. The crisis has spilled into the West Bank, where Israeli barriers to movement of persons and goods, coupled with broader trade restrictions and supply-chain disruptions, have severely impacted the economy, the ILO said. Israel says its actions in the West Bank have been necessary to counter Iranian-backed militant groups and to prevent harm to Israeli civilians. 'The impact of the war in the Gaza Strip has taken a toll far beyond loss of life, desperate humanitarian conditions and physical destruction,' said ILO regional director for Arab states Ruba Jaradat. 'It has fundamentally altered the socio-economic landscape of Gaza, while also severely impacting the West Bank’s economy and labour market. The impact will be felt for generations to come.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-unemployment-surges-to-80-as-economy-collapses-un-agency-says/7825682.html	2024-10-17T01:33:56-07:00	
North Korea says revised constitution now defines South as 'hostile state'	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea confirmed Thursday that its recently revised constitution defines South Korea as 'a hostile state' for the first time, two days after it blew up front-line road and rail links that once connected the country with the South. The back-to-back developments indicate North Korea is intent on escalating animosities against South Korea, increasing the danger of possible clashes at their tense border areas, though it's highly unlikely for the North to launch full-scale attacks in the face of more superior U.S. and South Korea forces. The official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that its recent demolition of parts of the northern sections of the inter-Korean road and rail links was 'an inevitable and legitimate measure taken in keeping with the requirement of the DPRK constitution which clearly defines the ROK as a hostile state.' DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's official name, while ROK stands for Republic of Korea, the South's formal name. South Korea's Unification Ministry condemned North Korea's constitutional reference to South Korea as a hostile state, calling it 'an anti-unification, anti-national act.' It said the South Korean government will sternly respond to any provocations by North Korea and unwaveringly push for a peaceful Korean unification based on the basic principle of freedom and democracy. North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament met for two days last week to rewrite the constitution but state media hadn't provided many details about the session. Leader Kim Jong Un had earlier called for the constitutional change at that parliamentary meeting to designate South Korea as the country's main enemy, remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification and define North Korea's sovereign, territorial sphere. Thursday's KCNA dispatch gave no further details of the new constitution, except the description of South Korea. 'There may still be an internal propaganda review underway about the appropriate way to disclose the constitutional revisions, but this confirmation was expected,' said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Kim's order in January to rewrite the constitution caught many foreign experts by surprise because it was seen as eliminating the idea of shared statehood between the war-divided Koreas and breaking away with his predecessors' long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North's terms. In the past months, North Korea has torn down monuments symbolizing rapprochement with South Korea and abolished state agencies handling inter-Korean relations. Some experts say Kim likely aims to guard against South Korean cultural influence and bolster his family's dynastic rule. Others say Kim wants legal room to use his nuclear weapons against South Korea by making it as a foreign enemy state, not a partner for potential unification which shares a sense of national homogeneity. They say Kim may also want to seek direct dealings with the U.S. in future diplomacy on its nuclear program, not via South Korea. 'North Korea has fallen so far behind the South that any social exchange or financial integration might look like paths to unification by absorption,' said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'Pyongyang's rejection of peaceful Korean unification is thus a strategy for regime survival and maintaining domestic control. This not only bodes ill for diplomacy but could also become an ideology motivating military aggression against Seoul,' Easley said. KCNA, citing North Korea's Defense Ministry, reported that North Korea on Tuesday blew up the 60-meter (197 feet)-long sections of two pairs of the roads and railway routes — one pair on the western portion of the inter-Korean border and the other on the eastern side of the border. Largely built with South Korean money, the road and rail links were once a major symbol of now-dormant inter-Korean reconciliation movements. In the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected the road and rail routes for the first time since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but their operations were halted later as the rivals bickered over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures. South Korean officials said North Korea had been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. Animosities between the Koreas increased in recent days, with North Korea accusing South Korea of flying drones over its capital Pyongyang three times this month and vowing strong military responses if similar incidents happen again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned that North Korea will face a regime demise if the safety of South Korean citizens is threatened. Many observers say North Korea won't likely launch a full-blown war because it knows its military is outgunned by the U.S. and South Korean forces, and that North Korea ultimately aims to use its advancing nuclear program as leverage to wrest sanctions relief from the U.S. But they say a miscalculation could still lead to border clashes. Intense outside attention has been on whether the North Korean constitutional change includes new legal, territorial claims around the Koreas' disputed western sea boundary, the site where several deadly skirmishes and bloodsheds happened in the past 25 years. 'South Korea and the United States need not overreact to North Korean moves. The recent drone incident raises the possibility of miscalculation and escalation,' Panda, the expert, said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-revised-constitution-now-defines-south-as-hostile-state-/7825679.html	2024-10-17T01:14:49-07:00	
Japan's ruling LDP at risk of losing majority in election, polls show	TOKYO — Japan's ruling party may lose its majority in the lower house, according to media polling ahead of the October 27 election, meaning it would likely have to rely on coalition partner Komeito to stay in power. The Liberal Democratic Party may not reach the 233 seats it needs for an outright majority in the 465-seat chamber, the Nikkei newspaper said on Thursday. The LDP has held sole control of the chamber since it returned to power in 2012 after three years in opposition. In a separate poll by Jiji Press, support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet came to 28%, marking the lowest percentage of support for new governments dating back to 2000. The survey was conducted October 11-14 and published Thursday. Ishiba's government already depends on Komeito for a majority in the upper house. Extending that reliance to the more powerful lower house could give the group, backed by Japan's largest Buddhist lay organization, a greater say in policymaking. 'I think that the LDP will cover, along with its coalition ally Komeito, the majority that it needs,' said Michael Cucek, a professor specializing in politics at Temple University in Tokyo. If the LDP is relying on Komeito to reach a majority, that will give more leverage to a party that has pushed back on some of the LDP's more hawkish security policies in the past, he added. Komeito has been less willing than the LDP to embrace policies including giving Japan's military longer-range missiles and removing restrictions on weapons exports that have stopped Tokyo from sending arms to Ukraine or Southeast Asian nations that oppose Beijing's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. Nobuyuki Baba, the head of the Japan Innovation Party, the third-largest group in the lower house, has not ruled out working with the LDP after the election, media reported. He supports expanding Japan's military capabilities and has said he would also back an amendment to Japan's pacifist constitution to officially recognize the armed forces. The Nikkei said its nationwide poll, conducted along with the Yomiuri newspaper, garnered responses from 165,820 people randomly contacted by phone on Tuesday and Wednesday. A poll by broadcaster TBS released on Wednesday showed the LDP may lose about 30 seats, while Komeito may shed a small number. A separate poll of more than 150,000 people published by Kyodo on Wednesday also pointed to challenges for the LDP to secure a majority. Ishiba dissolved the lower house of parliament on October 9, setting up the snap election. He became leader last month after his predecessor Fumio Kishida ended his three-year premiership due to public distrust stemming from a string of funding scandals involving LDP politicians.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-s-ruling-ldp-at-risk-of-losing-majority-in-election-polls-show/7825672.html	2024-10-17T00:55:08-07:00	
Thai celebrities among 18 arrested for pyramid scheme	Bangkok — Thai police have arrested 18 people, including three celebrities, and seized luxury sports cars and millions of dollars in connection with a pyramid scheme selling health and dietary supplements, officers said Thursday. The arrests came after more than 1,000 people filed online fraud allegations against The iCon Group, a company they said had lured them into buying products and making financial commitments. The company's founder and CEO, Warathaphon 'Boss Paul' Waratyaworrakul, was detained on Wednesday along with a top TV host and an actress who had allegedly helped convince victims to join the scheme. Authorities said they had frozen $3.8 million held in the bank accounts of the company's four executives and confiscated luxury vehicles including Porsches and Ford Mustangs. Police were looking into bank accounts and cash transfers linked to the suspects to find out if any more people were involved, Thailand's police chief Kitrat Phanphet told reporters. The company allegedly lured its victims by offering cheap online sales courses. Once enrolled, it coerced them into making further purchases and financial commitments ranging from $75 to $7,500 which was used to advertise for new recruits. Some of the victims — who ranged from low-income workers to a high-earning footballer — had paid more than $18,000 to the company, according to local media. Police are yet to tally the total amount swindled. Thailand is no stranger to public fraud cases. A 'Forex-3D' scheme last year tricked thousands into investing in a fake foreign exchange trading platform. The world's longest non-life sentence, according to the 'Guinness Book of Records,' was imposed on Thai pyramid scheme fraudster Chamoy Thipyaso, who was jailed for 141,078 years in 1989. However she was released after only eight years behind bars despite having conned some members of the royal household.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-celebrities-among-18-arrested-for-pyramid-scheme/7825670.html	2024-10-17T00:45:34-07:00	
Indonesia's Prabowo gets support from biggest party	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's largest political party said it would support incoming president Prabowo Subianto, but it was unclear Thursday whether it would formally join his already dominant coalition just days ahead of the inauguration ceremony. If Prabowo, who will take over the presidency on Sunday, can reach a deal with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) there would be no opposition parties in parliament, an unprecedented situation since Indonesia began holding direct presidential elections in 2004. 'We're solid in supporting the incoming government as a way to build Indonesia's future,' Puan Maharani, house speaker and a senior PDIP official, said Wednesday, according to state media. It was unclear whether or not she meant the PDIP was joining the coalition. The PDIP did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for clarification of the comment. There has been persistent talk about a meeting between PDIP chief Megawati Sukarnoputri and Prabowo in recent weeks, and Puan said one would 'hopefully' take place but did not give a specific time. A top Prabowo aide said earlier this week the two would meet without giving details on timing. Prabowo briefed his would-be ministers Wednesday on economic and geopolitical issues, as Cabinet assessments continued. He has summoned dozens of people this week who said they had been asked to join the next government, including current finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. His Cabinet has not been officially unveiled. Budi Gunawan, a former chief of Indonesia's Intelligence Agency who is considered close to the PDIP, attended Prabowo's briefing for his potential ministers, Budi Arie Setiadi, another ministerial candidate who attended the meeting, told Reuters. While not formally a part of the PDIP, Budi Gunawan is known to be close to party chief Megawati and often attends party events. The absence of any opposition in the parliament would ensure smooth passage of Prabowo's legislative agenda but would likely heighten fears about a lack of meaningful checks on Prabowo's power in a country with a history of authoritarian rule. Seven of the eight parties in parliament have already joined Prabowo's coalition, securing him a parliamentary majority. PDIP, which won the most seats in the February election, had nominated Prabowo's predecessor, Joko Widodo, for president in 2014. But their relationship soured over President Widodo's tacit support for Prabowo during his election campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-prabowo-gets-support-from-biggest-party/7825656.html	2024-10-17T00:23:45-07:00	
South Korean court acquits former police chief over deadly crowd crush	SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court found the former police chief of the country's capital and two other officers not guilty over a botched response to a Halloween crowd crush that killed nearly 160 people in 2022. The verdict by the Seoul Western District Court drew angry responses from grieving relatives and their advocates, who accused the court of refusing to hold high-level officials accountable for an incident that was largely blamed on a lack of disaster planning and an inadequate emergency response. Kim Kwang-ho, former chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, was the most senior police official among more than 20 police and government officials indicted over the crush in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district in Seoul. Prosecutors had sought a five-year prison term for Kim. An investigation led by the National Police Agency found that police and local officials failed to plan effective crowd control measures even though they expected more than 100,000 people to gather for Halloween events in the Itaewon neighborhood. The investigators found that Seoul police assigned just 137 officers to Itaewon on the day of the crush. Police also ignored hotline calls placed by pedestrians who warned of swelling crowds before the surge turned deadly. Once people began getting crushed in an alley near Hamilton Hotel, they failed to establish control over the site and allow paramedics to reach the injured in time. Some experts have called the crush a 'manmade disaster' that could have been prevented with relatively simple steps like employing more police and public workers to monitor bottleneck points, enforcing one-way walking lanes and blocking narrow pathways. The Seoul court acquitted Kim of professional negligence, saying that prosecutors failed to prove that Kim had violated his duties or to establish a connection between his conduct and the high death toll and injuries. The court also acquitted two lower-ranking police officers who faced similar charges. Itaewon Disaster Bereaved Families, a group representing the victims of the crush, said the ruling was 'dishonest' and 'impossible to understand' and called for prosecutors to appeal. 'We strongly condemn that the main officials of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, who ignored their duties for prevention, preparation and response despite anticipating that a large crowd would develop, and who have been denying their responsibility until now, are being given a free pass,' the group said. The same court earlier this month sentenced the former chief of Seoul's Yongsan district police station to three years in prison and convicted two of his colleagues of professional negligence resulting in death, citing their failure to properly prepare for the crowd and respond to the crush. One of the other officers was also sent to prison, while the other received a suspended sentence. The court acquitted Park Hee-young, head of the Yongsan ward office, and three other ward officials, saying that they had no legal authority to control or break up crowds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-acquits-former-police-chief-over-deadly-crowd-crush/7825659.html	2024-10-17T00:17:43-07:00	
India flight from Frankfurt hit with latest fake threat	Bengaluru, India — The latest in a string of hoax threats made against Indian airlines targeted a flight from Germany, the airline said Thursday, with the plane landing safely in Mumbai. More than a dozen fake bomb threats have been made against flights operated by multiple Indian air services this week, prompting government and civil aviation authorities to warn that 'very strict action' will be taken. India's Vistara airline said Thursday that its passenger jet flying from Frankfurt to Mumbai the day before had received a 'security threat' on social media, but landed safely at its planned destination. 'We are fully cooperating with the security agencies to complete the mandatory security checks,' Vistara said in a statement. India's aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said late Wednesday that the police had arrested 'a minor responsible for issuing bomb threats' against three flights. 'All others responsible for the disruptions will be identified and duly prosecuted,' Naidu said. Flights impacted include an Air India plane from New Delhi to Chicago, forced to make an emergency landing in Canada on Tuesday. On the same day, Singapore scrambled fighter jets to escort an Air India Express plane.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-flight-from-frankfurt-hit-with-latest-fake-threat/7825621.html	2024-10-17T00:03:36-07:00	
One Direction singer Liam Payne dead after falling from Buenos Aires hotel balcony	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Former One Direction singer Liam Payne was found dead after the 31-year-old fell from his third-floor room balcony at a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentine police said on Wednesday. Police said in a statement that they were called to the CasaSur hotel in the capital's leafy Palermo neighborhood after being notified of an 'aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol.' When they arrived, the hotel manager reported he had heard a loud noise from the inner courtyard and the police found that a man had fallen from the balcony of his room, the statement said. In audio related to the case obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry, a worker can be heard asking for police help. 'When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,' the worker said, adding that the guest's life was at risk because the room had a balcony. Shooting to global fame as part of one of the best-selling boy bands of all time, Payne - like his band mates Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson - went on to pursue a solo career after they went on an 'indefinite hiatus' in 2016. Payne's last single was 'Teardrop,' released in March this year. While many of the details surrounding the circumstances of his death remain unclear, Payne had spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame. His death led to an outpouring of grief from music industry stars and fans, including those among the crowd who gathered outside the hotel. Violeta Antier said she had come straight away after being told Payne had died. 'I saw him two weeks ago at a Niall (Horan) concert, another One Direction member. He was there, I saw him,' she said. 'He was ok.' Payne attended an October 2 concert by Horan in Buenos Aires. The two had posted videos together and with fans. American singer Charlie Puth was among those expressing their grief. 'I am in shock right now. Liam was always so kind to me,' he said on Instagram. 'He was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone.' Payne auditioned for the British version of X Factor for a second time in 2010 at the age of 16 and was put into a group with his future band mates by music mogul Simon Cowell. Cowell told Rolling Stone in a 2012 interview that he'd 'always backed' Payne at the time of his first audition in 2008 but he didn't quite make it because he had been too young. 'But I always knew that with confidence he would be a valuable member of this band, so I had no hesitation in bringing him back,' he said. The band may have finished third in X Factor that year but it went on to have more than 29 hits on Billboard's Hot 100 with six in the top 10, including 'What Makes You Beautiful,' 'Story of My Life' and 'Live While We're Young.' Payne's co-writing credits include 'Story of My Life' and 'Night Changes'. He teamed up with Rita Ora on the 2018 song 'For You' and released his first studio album LP1 in 2019. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne's One Direction and solo career helped garner him a net worth of some $70 million. Payne had a son named Bear with British TV personality and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl. Last year, he published a video to fans on his YouTube channel in which he spoke about his family, making new art and performing again after having given up alcohol. He thanked supporters for sticking with him through difficult times. Earlier on Wednesday, Payne had appeared to post on Snapchat about his trip in Argentina, talking about riding horses, playing polo, and looking forward to returning home to see his dog. 'It's a lovely day here in Argentina,' he said in the video.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-direction-singer-liam-payne-dead-after-falling-from-buenos-aires-hotel-balcony/7825620.html	2024-10-16T23:59:15-07:00	
Ukraine reports destroying 22 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 22 of 56 drones that Russian forces used in attacks overnight targeting areas in central and western Ukraine. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Ternopil, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram the attack damaged an apartment building. In Mykolaiv, Governor Vitalii Kim said Russia targeted energy infrastructure. Officials in Sumy also said the Russia attack damaged an apartment building and several emergency vehicles. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed six Ukrainian drones over the Oryol region, four drones over Kursk and three drones over Bryansk. Officials in those regions did not report any damage or casualties. U.S. President Joe Biden talked with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wednesday about defense aid for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. Biden also announced a $425 million security assistance package for Ukraine that includes additional air defense capabilities, air-to-ground munitions, armored vehicles and munitions critical to addressing its pressing military needs. The United States is set to supply Ukraine with more equipment in the coming months, including hundreds of air defense interceptors, dozens of tactical air defense systems, additional artillery systems, hundreds of armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles. Biden is scheduled to host a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group next month to coordinate international assistance for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is planning to press his country’s case for NATO membership on Thursday when he meets in Brussels with defense ministers from the West’s key military alliance, but NATO chief Mark Rutte said 'difficult' issues remain before Ukraine can join. In a speech to Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday, Zelenskyy outlined what he described as a 'victory plan' to end Russia’s 32-month invasion, including a call for an unconditional invitation to join NATO and for the deployment of a nonnuclear deterrent to Russian aggression. 'Together with our partners, we must change the circumstances so that the war ends,' Zelenskyy said. 'Regardless of what [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants, we must all change the circumstances so that Russia is forced to peace.' Rutte said Ukraine’s eventual membership in NATO is 'irreversible' when the time is right, but because Kyiv cannot join while at war, he declined to put a timeline on membership. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and restore the country’s territorial lines before Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in 2014, a proposal Moscow has rejected. Under NATO’s charter, each of the 32 member nations is obligated to militarily help defend any of the other members if they are invaded, a provision that has only been invoked once, when numerous countries deployed troops to fight alongside U.S. forces fighting al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan after their 2001 attack killed nearly 3,000 people in the United States. NATO countries, led by the U.S., have sent billions of dollars of armaments to Ukraine for Kyiv’s deployment in fighting Russia but no troops. Other parts of Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan' include postwar reconstruction pledges from Ukrainian allies as well as help in defending Ukraine’s natural mineral resources. Zelenskyy has been discussing the plan in recent weeks in meetings with Western leaders. He said he will do so again Thursday when he meets with European Union leaders in Brussels. Moscow criticized the Zelenskyy plan as risking a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. 'He is pushing NATO members towards a direct conflict with our country and is again insisting on getting permission to use long-range weapons on Russian territory,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Rutte did not directly respond to Kyiv's demand for a formal NATO invitation. 'NATO in Washington decided to make the path towards NATO membership for Ukraine [an] irreversible path,' Rutte said. 'We are in close contact with allies, with Ukraine, to see how we can take next steps, how to do that in a way which is also successful.' Rutte said he is discussing aspects of Zelenskyy’s plan with NATO member countries. 'The victory plan, of course, we are very much debating with them and using every opportunity to take that one step by step further,' Rutte said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has dismissed Zelenskyy’s proposal, calling it an 'ephemeral peace plan.' 'The only peace plan there can be is for the Kyiv regime to realize the futility of the policy it is pursuing and understand the need to sober up,' Peskov said. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-destroying-22-russian-drones/7825616.html	2024-10-16T23:50:25-07:00	
China boosts funds for housing projects to support embattled sector	BEIJING — China will expand a 'white list' of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to $562 billion by year-end, Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said on Thursday. Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million 'urban villages' to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled will help absorb existing housing inventories. The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilizing a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021, dragging on broader growth in the world's second-largest economy. 'It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun,' Ni told reporters. Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. No official estimates have been released on the number of presold but unfinished homes. According to a Nomura report published in January, 20 million units were sold but not yet constructed. Ni said 2.46 million new homes have been delivered since May. In January, China announced a plan for a 'white list' of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers. As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly $195 billion. Approved loans for the 'white list' projects had risen to $312 billion as of Oct. 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference. The country's CSI300 real estate index shed 5% to hand back two days of gains in shares, with no new steps to excite markets. 'From today's press conference, we think few incremental policies on boosting home demand were announced,' said Morningstar Research equity analyst Jeff Zhang. 'The most significant directive pertains to credit support to projects in whitelist... We expect an acceleration in execution with more distressed developers receiving funds for home completions, which would help shore up homebuyers' confidence.' On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land. In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15% for all buyers. Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference. The rate cuts helped households save $21 billion, she said. In a September meeting, the politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party helmed by President Xi Jinping, called for further measures to stabilize the market.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-boosts-funds-for-housing-projects-to-support-embattled-sector/7825614.html	2024-10-16T23:47:08-07:00	
As leaders gather, EU migration plan may be too little, too late	BRUSSELS — European Union leaders will use a summit Thursday to seek ways to make the bloc a more hostile destination for migrants and asylum seekers following a recent surge in support for the extreme right, which has fomented opposition to foreigners. As the summit opens in Brussels, the 27 EU leader are looking at plans to speed up initiatives to get unwanted migrants out of the bloc and process asylum applications far outside their borders. The tenor of the debate is a far cry from 2015, less than a decade ago, when the EU was faced with a migration crisis. Well over a million migrants and refugees sought help then, mainly from the Middle East and Afghanistan. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the EU's dominant national leader at the time, famously said, 'We can manage that.' Now, EU leaders want to manage and seal off their borders ever more tightly, embracing initiatives that would have looked unacceptable only a few years ago. In recent weeks, Poland has said it wants to temporarily suspend the right to asylum, Italy has opened two centers to process asylum seekers outside its borders in Albania, and Germany has reinstated border controls — all of them measures going in the same direction. 'Migration remains an essential internal issue,' said a senior EU diplomat, despite the adoption in May of a sweeping asylum plan that is to become operational in 2026. The plan lays out rules for the 27 member countries to handle people trying to enter without authorization, from how to screen them to establish whether they qualify for protection to deporting them if they're not allowed to stay. It also sets out a mechanism for burden-sharing, which has been rejected by Hungary and Poland. But with the extreme right surging in the EU parliamentary elections in June and in other polls in Germany and Austria since, migration remains a trigger button for leaders. Even if some 3.5 million migrants arrived legally in Europe in 2023, some 1 million others were on EU territory without permission. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underscored that with an unusually detailed pre-summit letter to the leaders, insisting there was 'no room for complacency' as she called for parts of the 2026 plan to be in place much sooner. 'If we look at events, even of the past summer, we know we must stay ambitious, including on our timeframe,' the letter said. This ambition also extends to setting up 'innovative' projects, like Italy's outsourcing of asylum applications to Albania. 'We will also be able to draw lessons from this experience in practice,' wrote von der Leyen. On Wednesday, an Italian navy ship docked at the Albanian port of Shengjin to bring the first group of 16 migrants intercepted in international waters for processing there. Under a five-year deal signed last November by Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, up to 3,000 migrants picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania. They will be screened initially on board the ships that rescue them before being sent to Albania for further assessment. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will also be presenting his plan to suspend the right for migrants to seek asylum, one of the fundamental rights established in Europe after World War II. Poland has accused Belarus and Russia of organizing the mass transfer of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to the EU's eastern borders to destabilize the West. Tusk says it is part of a hybrid war as Moscow continues its nearly three-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Even though Tusk was criticized by several human rights organizations, others have shown understanding for Poland's predicament. But EU nations have for years been deeply divided over how to deal with migrants arriving irregularly in the bloc and how to share the effort to deal with them, making it unlikely that any decisive action will come out of Thursday's summit. The position of Spain, which takes in tens of thousands of African migrants who reach the Canary Islands, has underscored the scale of the EU's internal divisions. Even if Spain agrees to hasten the implementation of the 2026 plans, it is opposed to some of the other policies being trialed elsewhere. 'Spain has expressed it is against contemplating the creation of centers in third-party countries,' said government spokeswoman Pilar Alegría. 'And it goes without saying that the position we are going to continue to defend in Europe is the humanitarian application' of the new migration pact. But even so, critics already say that the plan will let nations detain migrants at borders and fingerprint children. They say it's aimed at keeping people out and infringes on their right to claim asylum.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-leaders-gather-eu-migration-plan-may-be-too-little-too-late/7825606.html	2024-10-16T23:36:34-07:00	
Sydney beaches closed due to toxic 'tar balls'	sydney — Beaches in Sydney including the iconic Bondi were closed to bathers on Thursday after hundreds of black balls suspected to be toxic washed up on the city's shores. Waverley Council said it had closed Bondi, Bronte and Tamarama beaches as a precaution, while neighboring Randwick Council has closed an additional four beaches to the south. Bondi and Maroubra Beach to the south were later reopened. 'The wellbeing of our community is paramount. That's why Council has taken the precaution to close our beaches,' Waverley Mayor Will Nemesh said in a statement. Preliminary testing by Randwick Council suggests the mystery items were 'tar balls' – lumps of oil and debris. 'We've got so many pollutants in the atmosphere, so many pollutants on the boats, so many pollutants, plastic, it's going to come to our beaches, it's everywhere else in the world unfortunately,' said Monica O'Connell, a resident of Coogee, one of the beaches closed by Randwick Council. New South Wales state's Environment Protection Authority said it was conducting its own tests, advising against swimming near or touching any of the balls. Sydney is home to more than 100 beaches in its harbor and along its oceanfront that are famous across the world, attracting millions of tourists and locals each year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sydney-beaches-closed-due-to-toxic-tar-balls-/7825604.html	2024-10-16T23:36:22-07:00	
LA Archdiocese agrees to pay $880 million to clergy sexual abuse victims	LOS ANGELES — The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has agreed to pay $880 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse dating back decades, in what an attorney said was the largest single child sex abuse settlement with a Catholic archdiocese, it was announced Wednesday. After the announcement of the agreement in principle, Archbishop José H. Gomez said in a statement, 'I am sorry for every one of these incidents, from the bottom of my heart.' 'My hope is that this settlement will provide some measure of healing for what these men and women have suffered,' the archbishop added. 'I believe that we have come to a resolution of these claims that will provide just compensation to the survivor-victims of these past abuses.' Attorneys for 1,353 people who allege that they suffered horrific abuse at the hands of local Catholic priests reached the settlement after months of negotiations with the archdiocese, the Los Angeles Times reported. The agreement caps a quarter-century of litigation against the most populous archdiocese in the United States. Attorneys in the Plaintiffs' Liaison Committee said in a joint statement, 'While there is no amount of money that can replace what was taken from these 1,353 brave individuals who have suffered in silence for decades, there is justice in accountability.' Under the settlement, the plaintiffs will engage in a process— that will not involve the archdiocese — to allocate the settlement amount among the participants. The archdiocese has previously paid $740 million to victims in various settlements and had pledged to better protect its church members, so this settlement would put the total payout at more than $1.5 billion, the Times said. Attorney Morgan Stewart, who led the negotiations, said in a statement that the settlement is the largest single child sex abuse settlement with a Catholic archdiocese. 'These survivors have suffered for decades in the aftermath of the abuse. Dozens of the survivors have died. They are aging, and many of those with knowledge of the abuse within the church are too. It was time to get this resolved,' Stewart told the Times. The settlement will be funded by archdiocese investments, accumulated reserves, bank financing, and other assets. According to the archdiocese, certain religious orders and others named in the litigation will also cover some of the cost of the settlement, the Times said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/la-archdiocese-agrees-to-pay-880-million-to-clergy-sexual-abuse-victims/7825560.html	2024-10-16T21:07:13-07:00	
US strikes Houthi weapons storage sites in Yemen	U.S. forces carried out airstrikes Wednesday against Houthi militant weapons storage sites in Yemen, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. The strikes, conducted by B-2 bombers, targeted weapons the Houthis have used in a yearlong campaign of attacks against ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that have disrupted major sea shipping routes. 'This was a unique demonstration of the United States’ ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified,' Austin said. The Iran-backed Houthis have said their campaign of using boats, missiles and drones to target vessels is being done in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the war in Gaza. The United States and Britain have conducted multiple strikes against the Houthis to try to protect the shipping lanes, while commercial companies have rerouted many ships to use the longer and more expensive route of going around the African continent. 'The Houthis’ illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces’ lives at risk,' Austin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-strikes-houthi-weapons-storage-sites-in-yemen/7825553.html	2024-10-16T20:42:08-07:00

Mexican official sentenced to 38-plus years in US for taking cartel bribes	NEW YORK — The man once heralded as the architect of Mexico's war on drug cartels was sentenced to more than 38 years in a U.S. prison Wednesday for taking massive bribes to aid drug traffickers. Genaro García Luna, Mexico's former secretary of public security, was convicted by a New York jury in 2023 of taking millions of dollars in bribes to protect the violent Sinaloa cartel that he was supposedly combating. He is the highest-level Mexican government official to be convicted in the United States. At his sentencing hearing before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Wednesday, García Luna continued to maintain his innocence and said the case against him was based on false information from criminals and the Mexican government. 'I have a firm respect for the law,' he said in Spanish. 'I have not committed these crimes.' García Luna, 56, led Mexico's federal police before he served in a Cabinet-level position as the top security official from 2006-12 under then-President Felipe Calderón. At the time, García Luna was hailed as an ally by the U.S. in its fight on drug trafficking. But U.S. prosecutors said that in return for millions of dollars, he provided intelligence about investigations against the cartel, information about rival gangs and the safe passage of massive quantities of drugs. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. García Luna's lawyers had argued that he should get no more than 20 years. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan said he wasn't moved by past accolades that García Luna received for his work in the war on drugs. 'That was your cover,' Cogan said before imposing the sentence. 'You are guilty of these crimes, sir. You can't parade these words and say, 'I'm police officer of the year.'' Besides the sentence of 38 years and four months, the judge imposed a $2 million fine. During the trial, photos were shown of García Luna shaking hands with former President Barack Obama and speaking with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John McCain. But prosecutors said García Luna secretly advanced a drug trafficking conspiracy that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Mexican citizens. He ensured that drug traffickers were notified in advance of raids and sabotaged legitimate police operations aimed at apprehending cartel leaders, they said. Drug traffickers were able to ship more than 1 million kilograms of cocaine through Mexico and into the United States using planes, trains, trucks and submarines while García Luna held his posts, prosecutors said. During former Sinaloa kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán's trial in the same court in 2018, a former cartel member testified that he personally delivered at least $6 million in payoffs to García Luna and that cartel members agreed to pool up to $50 million to pay for his protection. 'He enabled the cartel. He protected the cartel. He was the cartel,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy told the judge Wednesday. García Luna enabled a corrupt system that allowed violent cartels to thrive and distribute drugs that killed multitudes of people, she added. 'It may not have been the defendant pulling the trigger, but he has blood on his hands,' Komatireddy said. Prosecutors also said García Luna plotted to undo last year's verdict by seeking to bribe or corruptly convince multiple inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn to support false allegations that two government witnesses communicated via contraband cellular phones in advance of the trial. García Luna's lawyer, Cesar de Castro, said the defense intends to appeal the sentence. He said his client is someone who 'has served his country' and has now lost his money, his reputation as well as policies he championed in Mexico. 'He has lost close to everything. All that remains is his wonderful family,' de Castro said. In Mexico, newly inaugurated President Claudia Sheinbaum briefly commented on the case Tuesday, saying: 'The big issue here is how someone who was awarded by United States agencies, who ex-President Calderón said wonderful things about his security secretary, today is prisoner in the United States because it's shown that he was tied to drug trafficking.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-official-sentenced-to-38-plus-years-in-us-for-taking-cartel-bribes/7825414.html	2024-10-16T18:24:44-07:00	
Colombian ranchers aim to prove beef production can be good for planet	Scientists say beef production takes a heavy toll on the environment.

Billie Jean King, female athletes to honor her Women's Sports Foundation	NEW YORK — Billie Jean King started the Women's Sports Foundation with a $5,000 check. She's turned that investment into $100 million and a half century of helping girls and women achieve their dreams through travel and training grants, local sports programs, and mentorship of athletes and coaches. King was set to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation by honoring the 1999 U.S. women's World Cup champions; Mark Walter, co-owner of the Professional Women's Hockey League and the Los Angeles Dodgers; and the Women's National Basketball Association's 2024 rookie class on Wednesday night in New York. 'What makes me happy is creating opportunities and dreams for others,' King told The Associated Press in a recent interview. 'I look back and that's what drives me.' Nearly 100 female athletes will attend the awards dinner to celebrate the milestone and King, a tireless advocate for equal pay and more investment in women's sports. That includes awards host and soccer honoree Julie Foudy. She graduated from Stanford and played for the 1999 U.S. soccer team that won the World Cup before a record crowd of more than 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. 'She's remained a friend and mentor and such a catalyst for changing the trajectory of women's soccer and so many sports,' said Foudy, a former president of the Women's Sports Foundation and current soccer broadcaster for Turner and TNT. After the World Cup win, Foudy and the team turned to King, Donna Lopiano and Donna de Verona for advice about improving pay and starting a professional soccer league. 'I'll never forget, (King) said, 'What are you guys doing about it?' ' said Foudy, regarding their collective leverage with the U.S. Soccer Federation. 'And as players, that was the exact epiphany we needed at that moment.' Foudy and the '99ers eventually witnessed the successful struggle toward equity, helping lay the foundation for the current U.S. women's national team to receive the same pay and working conditions as the men's team. A players' lawsuit against the federation resulted in a landmark $24 million settlement in 2022. 'Billie doesn't have just one meeting. She'd check in and follow up and ask, 'What do you need?' ' Foudy said. 'She was at that first (WUSA professional) game in Washington, D.C. (in 2001), and was a big proponent of the importance of having a league and player pool for the longevity and growth of women's soccer.' The current iteration is the NWSL, which formed in 2013 and now has 14 teams. Foudy is part of the ownership group of Angel City FC. New owners Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a controlling stake in the team in July, with a value of $250 million. King recently joined forces with Mark and Kimba Walter to create the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), which will launch its second season in late November. U.S. Olympic gold medalist Kendall Coyne Schofield reached out to King to help unify the fractured pro hockey landscape into one viable league. King, who is part of the Dodgers' ownership group, collaborated with Walter to form the new six-team league. The WNBA rookie class, led by No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark, will receive the Next Gen Award for 'showing up, showing out and boldly carrying the torch forward.' The popularity of Indiana's Clark and Chicago's Angel Reese generated unprecedented WNBA attendance, more nationally televised games and record-breaking TV ratings this summer. 'Caitlin Clark is fantastic,' King said. 'It reminds me of Chris Evert in 1971, when she changed everything at the U.S Open. Anytime a player can do well, she helps everybody.' The rookie class includes Cameron Brink (Stanford), Kamilla Cardoso (NCAA champion South Carolina), Rickea Jackson (Tennessee), Jacy Sheldon (Ohio State), Aaliyah Edwards (Connecticut), Reese (Louisiana State) and Alissa Pili (Utah). The WNBA lags in pay equity, with Clark receiving only $76,000 in her rookie season compared with the NBA No. 1 pick, who gets $12 million. WNBA players may see an increase in salary in 2026 from a new 11-year media rights deal for approximately $200 million a year ahead of the next collective bargaining agreement. The players' union is interested in increasing the WNBA revenue share from 9.3%, while NBA players receive about 50% of the money generated from TV deals, ticket sales, merchandise and licensing. King said it might take more time to close the pay gaps because women's sports is 'still in its infancy.' 'The NBA is 78 years old, the WNBA is 28 years old,' King said. '(Former NBA Commissioner) David Stern made a huge difference. He was a marketing genius. We need to continue to do that for women's sports.' King and the 'Original Nine' helped market the early women's professional tennis circuit, and she formed the Women's Tennis Association with players a week before Wimbledon in 1973. She advocated for Title IX, beat Bobby Riggs and fought for equal prize money in tennis. Along the way, she won 39 Grand Slam titles during her career. The next milestone for King, 80, will be receiving the Congressional Gold Medal. It's one of the highest U.S. civilian honors for individuals whose achievements have a lasting impact on their field. 'The Women's Sports Foundation, nobody knew how long it would last,' she said. 'I look at the 50th anniversary as a continuation to create more opportunities. You can't let up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/billie-jean-king-female-athletes-to-honor-her-women-s-sports-foundation/7825363.html	2024-10-16T17:00:58-07:00	
Biden, dignitaries honor RFK widow, human rights champion Ethel Kennedy	washington — U.S. President Joe Biden joined former Democratic presidents and others to honor longtime human rights advocate and storied political family matriarch Ethel Kennedy at a memorial service in Washington on Wednesday after her death last week at age 96. The widow of Robert F. Kennedy — a former U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator, who was assassinated while seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 — founded a human rights center to carry on her husband's work. She never remarried and went on to raise her 11 children, enduring a host of other family tragedies along the way, including separate plane crashes that killed her parents, brother and nephew, as well as the untimely deaths of several of her children, grandchildren and a great-grandchild. She and her husband were devastated by the assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in Dallas in 1963. Biden, a fellow Irish Catholic who has leaned on his faith amid his own losses, including the death of his son Beau, said the Democratic family matriarch was there for him at his time of tragedy. He said her husband had been one of his heroes. 'Ethel was a hero in her own right,' Biden said in remarks at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, just blocks from the White House. Former Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, also reflected on her life. The son of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated just two months before Robert Kennedy, noted the two families' shared journey and understanding of sacrifice amid their work for social justice. 'Faith and history knitted us together. Respect and love has kept us together,' Martin Luther King III told the crowd. The Kennedys were known for their parties and Wednesday's service was no different, with scores of relatives filling the pews and high-profile attendees remembering the infectious spirit highlighted by her children and grandchildren. 'She was a spitfire,' Obama said. 'As serious as Ethel was about righting wrongs, she never seemed to take herself too seriously.' Other Democratic attendees included California Governor Gavin Newsom and former top U.S. diplomat and presidential candidate John Kerry. Country star Kenny Chesney sang 'You Are My Sunshine' while Sting surprised guests with 'Fragile' and Stevie Wonder with 'Isn't She Lovely.' Over the decades, Kennedy took up many causes championed by her late husband, including fighting poverty, working for social justice and protecting the environment. Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. She died on October 10 from complications following a stroke, her family said. Her daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend was Maryland's lieutenant governor, while her son Joseph P. Kennedy II represented Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her grandson, former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, serves as special envoy to Northern Ireland. Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine advocate and former independent presidential candidate, broke from his family's long Democratic ties to endorse Donald Trump in November's election. Many members of the Kennedy clan have denounced his election politics and backed the Democratic ticket, now led by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris after Biden stepped aside in July. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended Wednesday's service alongside his family but made no remarks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-dignitaries-honor-rfk-widow-human-rights-champion-ethel-kennedy/7825052.html	2024-10-16T15:53:33-07:00

Fuel costs force some Nigerian commuters to quit jobs	Abuja, nigeria — Surging fuel prices in Nigeria are making it unaffordable for some workers to commute to their jobs, forcing them to quit. The trend is hitting low-income and informal workers especially hard. Fuel in Nigeria now averages 66 cents per liter, a 15% hike since September. The price surge forced Victor Zion to quit his job, as commuting costs consumed the lion’s share of his $85 monthly salary. Zion said that what's left of his income after transportation expenses could no longer keep him afloat. 'When it happened that there was an increment in the cost of transportation, I spent up to 70% of my salary on transportation and that didn't make sense to me at all,' he said. 'Resigning from my job has actually impacted me financially.' Zion’s experience reflects that of many workers, especially in the informal sector, who make up the majority of Nigeria’s workers. Ifunnaya Oyakimo recently closed her gym business, unable to maintain a staff because workers resigned in droves. 'Some of them said they can no longer sustain themselves with the salary, and with the whole thing that is happening, I just had to let it all go, close the gym, sell off the equipment,' she said. Some employers, like Moses Ogwoke, who is in the printing business, are covering 60% of workers’ transport costs to retain staff and stay operational. Ogwoke said those costs cut into profits, threatening the sustainability of his business. 'We have jobs that need to be attended to,' he said. 'What we decided to do is to support them the little way we can in paying their transportation at least three times a week, while they take care for the remaining two days. But that money needs to come from somewhere, so from the little profit we are making, we are still dipping hands there to be able to run the office.' The crisis extends beyond individual struggles. There is the risk of further destabilization of the labor market in Nigeria, where the unemployment rate stands at 33%. Economist Akin Ogunshola outlined the dangers of the resignation trend and suggested possible policy solutions. 'If people are resigning, definitely, they may be tempted to take to crime, they may be tempted to take to corruption, fraud and so many other social vices that will impact negatively on the economy and the society. ... What government is to do to help the workforce is to subsidize the cost of transportation,' he said. Fuel prices soared in Nigeria last year after President Bola Tinubu ended subsidies that had kept prices low for many years. The government has promised relief, including buses that run on compressed natural gas, but many workers doubt the measures will be sufficient or will be implemented soon. With no immediate relief, many Nigerians face a tough choice — pay commuting costs or resign their jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fuel-costs-force-some-nigerian-commuters-to-quit-jobs/7825032.html	2024-10-16T15:34:14-07:00	
FBI, French authorities coordinate on Islamic State arrests	washington — Recent arrests in the United States and in Europe have law enforcement and intelligence agencies on alert, bolstering concerns about a reinvigorated Islamic State terror group bent on lashing out against the West. FBI officials Wednesday confirmed the bureau shared information with French authorities following last week’s arrest of 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, an Afghan national in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on charges connected to a mass shooting plot in the name of the Islamic State group, to coincide with the U.S. election in November. That information led to the arrest of a 22-year-old Afghan national in the Haute-Garonne region of France, who French officials say is linked to Tawhedi. That arrest followed the arrests of three other men in the same region, again carried out in coordination with the U.S. French anti-terrorism prosecutors said Saturday that the suspects, all of whom are said to be followers of the Islamic State, appear to have been involved in a plan to carry out an attack on a football stadium or a shopping center. 'The recent arrests in France and by the FBI's Oklahoma City field office demonstrate the importance of partnerships to detect and disrupt potential terrorist attacks,' the FBI said in a statement. 'The FBI's top priority is preventing acts of terrorism, and we are committed to working with our partners both overseas and in the United States to uncover any plots and protect our communities from violence,' it said. The arrests follow repeated warnings from Western counterterrorism officials that the Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, has set its sights on launching attacks against the U.S. and Europe. And many have raised specific concerns about the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or ISIS-K. IS-Khorasan 'does have the intention to carry out external attacks, including external attacks inside the United States,' said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, speaking during a Washington Post webcast last month. 'We are very concerned about the capacity of ISIS-K to potentially move operatives into the United States,' he added. Others have warned that IS, and IS-Khorasan, have each sought to expand recruiting efforts around the globe. Some Western officials and regional observers have told VOA that as far back as 2021, the IS Afghan affiliate was seeking to seed Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with small but highly capable cells and networks that could serve as the basis for future attacks. Some also have warned that IS-Khorasan has since built on those efforts, increasingly trying to target Afghans and Central Asians living in the West. 'We've seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora communities,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, speaking with VOA last week following the Oklahoma City arrest. 'It will be another important factor to watch as more information becomes available.'

Iran FM slams Western sanctions as 'hostile action,' state media says	Tehran, Iran — Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Wednesday that new Western sanctions against Iran were 'hostile action' and would not help to resolve regional tensions, state media reported. 'The new Western sanctions against Iran are considered a hostile action and will not help the existing situation,' he told reporters in Jordan's capital, Amman, according to IRNA state news agency. On Monday, the 27-member European Union imposed sanctions on prominent Iranian officials and entities, including airlines, accusing them of taking part in the transfer of missiles and drones for Russia to use in its war against Ukraine. Tehran has repeatedly denied the accusations. Last week, the United States expanded sanctions on Iran 's oil industry in response to Tehran's October 1 attack on Israel, which has vowed to respond. Iran said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region and a general in its Revolutionary Guards. Regional tensions have soared since the outbreak of the Gaza war in October last year, drawing in Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Iran was already reeling from crippling U.S. sanctions imposed following Washington's unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Iran 's president Masoud Pezeshkian, who took office in July, has prioritized reviving the deal. On Wednesday, Araghchi said the so-called Muscat process of indirect negotiations with the United States on nuclear issues 'has been halted for the time being.' Oman has long mediated between Iran and the United States, which cut ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Araghchi said, however, that exchanges with the U.S. on other issues are 'still ongoing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-fm-slams-western-sanctions-as-hostile-action-state-media-says/7824989.html	2024-10-16T14:09:38-07:00	
Iran's border security forces allegedly massacre 'dozens' of Afghan migrants	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities are looking into allegations that dozens of Afghan civilians were killed and injured by Iranian border forces while trying to enter that country from Pakistan illegally. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson in Kabul, said Wednesday that 'various governmental bodies' and Afghan diplomatic missions have initiated 'comprehensive investigations' to verify the reported casualties. 'As the incident is reported to have occurred beyond Afghanistan’s borders, the available information remains unverified,' Fitrat noted in his English-language statement posted on social media platform X. He added that a 'conclusive decision' would be made after a 'thorough clarification of the facts.' The Taliban probe was announced after an Iranian rights group, known as Halvash, initially reported the alleged Afghan casualties, saying they occurred Sunday in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchistan border province. The organization quoted survivors as saying that about 300 Afghan migrants were attempting to enter Iran unlawfully when they were assaulted by Iranian border guards, resulting in deaths and injuries. 'As of now, reliable sources confirm that the news about the deaths of dozens of illegal citizens at the Saravan border is not true,' Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran’s special presidential envoy for and ambassador to Kabul, said in a Persian language statement on X. He referred to an Iranian region adjacent to Washuk, a border district in Pakistan’s southwestern sparsely populated Baluchistan province. Qomi emphasized, however, that responding 'legally' to the 'illegal entry of unauthorized nationals' was 'the legitimate right of countries, and the border guards of any country are obliged to prevent the entry of illegal nationals.' The Iranian envoy wrote that 'managing border traffic is a shared responsibility, and neighboring countries must prevent unauthorized' crossings in line with their international border security obligations. Qomi reiterated that Tehran is determined to return undocumented asylum-seekers and deal sternly with illegal border crossers. 'I'm seriously concerned about reports of injuries & deaths of Afghans in Iran's #Saravan border area and I call for authorities to investigate transparently,' Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, said on X. 'Clarity is urgently needed. These reports don't stand in isolation. More dignity & safety is needed for Afghans worldwide,' Bennett wrote. Residents in the Pakistani border district of Washuk also reported the alleged Iranian assault on Afghan migrants, but they could not provide specific casualty details, citing the remoteness of the border area. Pakistani provincial authorities did not immediately comment on the alleged incident. Iran and Pakistan together host millions of documented and undocumented Afghan refugees. Both countries have deported hundreds of thousands of undocumented individuals back to Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power three years ago. According to the International Organization for Migration, the deportations continue daily, and almost 100,000 Afghans returned home from Pakistan and Iran in September alone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-border-security-forces-allegedly-massacre-dozens-of-afghan-migrants-/7824988.html	2024-10-16T14:09:25-07:00	
Ex-Las Vegas-area official gets at least 28 years in prison for killing reporter	las vegas — A former Las Vegas-area Democratic elected official was sentenced Wednesday to serve at least 28 years in Nevada state prison for killing an investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of his conduct in office two years ago and exposed an intimate relationship with a female coworker. A judge invoked sentencing enhancements for use of a deadly weapon and the age of the reporter to add eight years to the minimum 20-years-to-life sentence that a jury set in August after finding Robert Telles guilty of first-degree murder. 'The judge couldn't sentence him to any more time,' Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said after telling reporters the sentence represented justice for the community. 'She gave him the maximum.' Telles, 47, testified in his defense at trial, denying he stabbed Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German to death in September 2022. But evidence against him was strong — including his DNA beneath German's fingernails. Telles was the administrator of a county office that handles unclaimed estate and probate cases when he was arrested and jailed without bail several days after German's murder. He was stripped of his elected position weeks later. Standing in shackles before the judge on Wednesday, Telles offered 'deepest condolences' to German's family but again denied responsibility for the reporter's death. 'I understand the desire to seek justice and hold somebody accountable for this,' he said. 'But I did not kill Mr. German.' Prosecutor Pamela Weckerly told the judge that evidence showed Telles killed German because 'he didn't like what Mr. German had written about him. He felt that Mr. German had cost him an elected position.' 'This type of violence, this sort of political violence,' the prosecutor said, 'is unacceptable and dangerous for a community as a whole.' Telles' defense attorney, Robert Draskovich, asked for leniency for Telles and told the judge that Telles intends to appeal his conviction. After sentence was pronounced, Draskovich withdrew as Telles' defense lawyer. 'The sentence was not surprising,' Draskovich said outside court. 'We fulfilled our defense obligation. We parted on good terms. [Telles] preserved all his rights for appeal.' German was 69. He was a respected reporter who spent 44 years covering crime, courts and corruption in Las Vegas. Telles lost his primary for a second term in office after German's stories in May and June 2022 described turmoil and bullying at the Clark County Public Administrator/Guardian office and a romantic relationship between Telles and a female employee. His law license was suspended following his arrest. Police sought public help to identify a person captured on neighborhood security video driving a maroon SUV and walking while wearing a broad straw hat that hid his face and an oversized orange long-sleeve shirt. Weckerly showed the jury footage of the person wearing orange slipping into the side yard where German was stabbed, slashed and left dead. At Telles' house, police found a maroon SUV and cut-up pieces of a straw hat and a gray athletic shoe that looked like those worn by the person seen on video. Authorities did not find the orange shirt or a murder weapon. Telles testified for several rambling hours at his trial, admitting for the first time that reports of the office romance were true. He said he was 'framed' for the crime by a broad conspiracy involving a real estate company, police, DNA analysts, former co-workers and others. He told the jury he was victimized for crusading to root out corruption. Wolfson and prosecutors at trial dismissed those claims as unbelievable. Other evidence pointed to Telles, who prosecutor Christopher Hamner told the jury blamed German for destroying his career, ruining his reputation and threatening his marriage. Telles told the jury he took a walk and went to a gym at the time German was killed. But evidence showed Telles' wife sent text messages to him about the same time asking, 'Where are you?' Prosecutors said Telles left his cellphone at home so he couldn't be tracked. The jury deliberated nearly 12 hours over three days before finding Telles guilty. Clark County District Court Judge Michelle Leavitt was able to consider sentencing enhancements adding time to Telles' sentence for using a deadly weapon in a willful, deliberate, premeditated killing and because German was older than 60 years old. 'This defendant has shown absolutely no remorse, no acceptance of responsibility,' said Wolfson, the Democratic elected regional prosecutor. 'And in fact, his behavior is such that I believe he is an extreme danger to the community if he is ever released.' German was the only journalist killed in the U.S. in 2022, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The nonprofit has records of 17 media workers killed in the U.S. since 1992.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-las-vegas-area-official-gets-at-least-28-years-in-prison-for-killing-reporter-/7824974.html	2024-10-16T13:54:05-07:00	
Lebanese refugee crisis raises political tensions in Iraq and demographic concerns in Kirkuk	Washington/Kirkuk, Iraq — Israeli airstrikes against Hezbollah are driving tens of thousands of Lebanese into Iraq — with more expected as the security situation deteriorates. The sudden influx is generating political concerns, especially in Iraq’s volatile Kirkuk region. Iraqi officials say that as of October 9, about 8,000 Lebanese refugees have entered Iraq. Kirkuk, a multi-ethnic province contested by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens, is already burdened with unresolved demographic and political tensions. The situation has been acute since many internally displaced Iraqis from the war against Islamic State have settled in Kirkuk rather than return to their original provinces. A senior Kurdish official there expressed apprehension that the arrival of Lebanese refugees could further complicate the area’s delicate demographic balance. Many of the refugees are coming from overwhelmingly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah is most influential. 'The arrival of Lebanese refugees in Kirkuk must be treated with caution,' the Kurdish official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, told VOA. 'Although the Iraqi government has made the decision to accept the refugees, the provinces are required to comply, but this must be done carefully.' Demographic risk? The official highlighted the precedent of Egyptian workers brought in prior to the U.S. overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, who never returned to their home country. He suggested that a similar pattern could emerge with the Lebanese refugees. On Sunday, the High Security Committee of Kirkuk, led by Rebwar Taha, convened to discuss preparations for handling the arrival of Lebanese refugees if they migrate to the province. 'Kirkuk itself is full of unresolved conflicts between Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmens. If the arrival of these refugees is not handled properly, the already accumulated issues will intensify,' the Kurdish official warned. While Kurdish officials voice their concerns, Shiite factions with close ties to Hezbollah advocate for welcoming the refugees, emphasizing humanitarian obligations. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani issued a letter on October 10 calling the Lebanese newcomers 'guests, not refugees.' He has ordered officials to 'facilitate entry into Iraq and humanitarian assistance.' Sunni Arabs also have raised concerns. Mahmoud Zaidan, a Sunni leader in Kirkuk, stressed that while humanitarian efforts are necessary, 'The government must carefully evaluate the situation, as the arrival of more refugees could exacerbate feelings of marginalization among Iraqis, particularly those displaced by the war with ISIS.' The timing of the refugee crisis coincides with Iraq’s preparations for a national census, which further complicates the situation. Observers suggest that Shiite political influence is driving the government’s decision to welcome the refugees. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanese-refugee-crisis-raises-political-tensions-in-iraq-and-demographic-concerns-in-kirkuk/7824966.html	2024-10-16T13:53:44-07:00	
US Supreme Court declines to pause EPA power plant emissions rule	The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to put on hold a new federal rule targeting carbon pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants at the request of numerous states and industry groups in another major challenge to President Joe Biden's efforts to combat climate change. The justices denied emergency requests by West Virginia, Indiana and 25 other states — most of them Republican led — as well as power companies and industry associations, to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rule while litigation continues in a lower court. The regulation, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, took effect July 8. The rule would require existing coal and new natural gas-fired plants eventually to reduce emissions including by capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The EPA's new rule, issued under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law, was issued two years after a major ruling by the Supreme Court in 2022 undercut the agency's power to issue sweeping regulations to force an electricity-generation shift from coal to cleaner energy sources. The EPA has said efforts to address climate change and its impacts such as extreme weather and rising sea levels must include the power sector because fossil fuel-fired plants make up 25% of overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, the rule mandates that coal plants operating past 2038 and certain new gas plants reduce emissions by 90% by 2032 including by using carbon capture and storage systems that extract carbon dioxide from plant exhaust and sequester it underground. The EPA has called the technology proven and technically feasible. The rule's challengers have said it has not been shown effective at the scale predicted by the EPA. The rule's requirements are 'really a backdoor avenue to forcing coal plants out of existence,' West Virginia, a major coal producer, and other state challengers said in a written filing. The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling was based on what is called the 'major questions' legal doctrine embraced by its conservative justices that requires explicit congressional authorization for action on issues of broad importance and societal impact. The states and certain other challengers contend that the EPA's new rule likewise implicates a major question and exceeds the agency's authority. Numerous states and industry players filed multiple lawsuits challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which on July 19 denied requests to pause the regulation pending its review. The case did not implicate a major question because the EPA's actions setting plant limits were 'well within' its statutory authority, the D.C. Circuit stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-supreme-court-declines-to-pause-epa-power-plant-emissions-rule/7824943.html	2024-10-16T13:36:38-07:00	
Georgia struggles to emerge from Russian shadow ahead of crucial election	Tbilisi, Georgia — On a clear October day, the snow-capped Caucasus mountain peaks of Georgia’s South Ossetia are visible from Tbilisi. Yet for most Georgians, the region is off-limits. South Ossetia, and Abkhazia farther to the west, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 1992. Both regions broke away from Georgia during the collapse of the Soviet Union, in brutal ethnic conflicts stoked by Moscow. Russia’s historical influence looms over Georgia’s upcoming election on Oct. 26, which is widely seen as a referendum on a future aligned to the West or to Moscow. The ruling Georgian Dream party has pledged to reconcile with the breakaway regions and reunite Georgia. 'I want to use this opportunity to address our people on the other side of occupation land in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali (South Ossetia) regions,' Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said at the United Nations’ General Assembly last month. 'Whatever actions we take are done to help our people, so that one day with our children we can live together in one happy, united and developed Georgia. On this side of the occupation line, we will always meet you with an open heart. We have to rebuild all the broken bridges in our country,' Kobakhidze added. Russian forces invaded Georgia in 2008, before formally recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. Several hundred Georgian soldiers and civilians died in the five-day conflict. Russia’s troops still occupy 20% of Georgian territory, including the two breakaway regions. Yet the billionaire founder of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, blames Georgia for the conflict, accusing the 'criminal regime' of former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili of starting the war on the orders of foreign powers. 'Immediately after the October 26 elections, those who instigated the war will face justice,' Ivanishvili said at a campaign event on Sept. 15 in Gori, a city briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2008. He said that Georgia would then apologize for the war. Ivanishvili’s comments sparked widespread anger among Georgians. Critics said it’s a stark example of Georgian Dream’s closer alignment with Russia — but this time, it backfired. 'In this case, they didn’t get a favorable response from Russia,' noted political analyst Ghia Nodia of Georgia’s Ilia State University. 'Russia stated that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are independent states, and reunification with Georgia isn’t going to happen.' Georgian Dream officials defended Ivanishvili’s comments. 'In order to resolve this conflict, of course, there’s the issue with Russia, but there’s also the problem between Georgian society and the Ossetians and Abkhazians,' said Nikoloz Samkharadze, a member of Georgian Dream and chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee. 'Reconciliation won’t happen unless these societies forgive and apologize to one another.' The legacy of Stalin The weight of history on the upcoming election extends from well before the collapse of communism and Georgian independence in 1991. Giorgi Kandelaki is from the Tbilisi-based Soviet Past Research Laboratory, an organization dedicated to busting romanticized myths about the Soviet Union and uncovering the truth of Communist rule. He said Georgian Dream’s leaders, aided by Moscow, are attempting to rewrite the history of Georgian-born Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin — an effort to stoke divisive culture wars ahead of the election. 'Many polls indicate that Stalin’s popularity is rising in Georgia, with him being seen as a model of Georgian patriotism,' Kandelaki told VOA. 'This narrative paints Western civilization as a threat, for example by attempting to ‘make us all gay,’ while portraying the Russian world, with an emphasis on religion, as the savior of our souls. In this project, Stalin, as an icon of Georgian patriotism, plays a crucial role. 'Georgian Dream, especially its grassroots supporters and local leaders in the regions, also plays a role in promoting this narrative,' he added. More than 70 years after his death, the debate over Stalin’s legacy remains a live issue in Georgia’s election. The European Union has frozen accession talks with the Georgian government, citing concerns over a slide towards autocracy. Last Friday, EU lawmakers approved a resolution that expressed regret over the 'growing cult of Stalin and the related increase in Soviet nostalgia in Georgia, supported by the ruling government, which underscores its closer alignment with Russia.' Georgian Dream strongly rejected that characterization. 'This is utter nonsense and absurd. No one is promoting the cult of Stalin in Georgia,' Samkharadze told VOA. 'I urge [EU lawmakers] to once again come to Georgia and show me the processes that supposedly contribute to promoting the cult of Stalin. This is especially offensive to me, considering I come from a family that was repressed by the Stalin regime.' The EU resolution, which calls for sanctions to be imposed on Ivanishvili, also suggested that the Georgian government was trying to bury the truth about what happened during Soviet times. 'Some of Georgia’s most important Soviet-era archives (including the archives of the former KGB and the former Central Committee of the Communist Party) have been completely closed since October 2023 without any explanation,' according to the EU parliament resolution. Giorgi Kandelaki of the Soviet Past Research Laboratory echoed that complaint. 'Since 2013, [the Georgian government] has implemented increasingly restrictive measures, gradually making it harder for researchers to access these archives. Today, it’s easier to study Soviet archives in Russia than it is in Georgia,' he said. Again, Georgian Dream denied those accusations. 'Regarding the archives, there are no restrictions, except for foreign citizens. Georgian citizens have no restrictions whatsoever,' Samkharadze told VOA. Georgian Dream insisted it intends to join the EU by 2030, an aspiration enshrined in the country’s constitution. The party denied it is pro-Russian, highlighting resolutions it has sponsored at the U.N. condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The party has held power since 2012 — but polls suggest it will struggle to retain its majority in the upcoming election. Aka Zarqua, the editor-in-chief of the website Realpolitika, said voters no longer trust Georgian Dream. 'The strategic ambiguity they tried to maintain over the years — claiming to support the EU and the West, while simultaneously taking anti-Western steps — has collapsed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-struggles-to-emerge-from-russian-shadow-ahead-of-crucial-election/7824935.html	2024-10-16T13:19:46-07:00	
Biden to travel to Germany this week, Angola in December for visits delayed by Hurricane Milton	Washington — President Joe Biden is heading to Germany Thursday and will visit Angola the first week in December, rescheduling visits that were postponed so he could remain in Washington to monitor the federal response to Hurricane Milton as it struck Florida. The White House confirmed Biden will depart for his quick trip to Berlin on Thursday. It will offer him the opportunity to huddle with his key ally, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, about their countries' support for Ukraine in its war with Russia as the conflict is at another critical moment. Biden's initial itinerary for the postponed trip included a meeting on the war in Ukraine with allied nations at an American military base in Germany before he was to continue on to Angola. The White House says that the gathering of representatives of the allied nations, partners in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, will instead take place virtually next month. Still, the war in Ukraine will loom large during Biden's time in Berlin this week. Biden spoke by phone Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but they will not meet while the president is in Germany. The two leaders discussed Zelenskyy's 'victory plan,' shortly after the Ukrainian leader presented it to his parliament . Zelenskyy is scheduled to present the five-point plan to the European Council on Thursday. Zelenskyy had previously spoken to Biden about the proposal. The plan includes an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO and permission to use Western-supplied longer-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russian territory — steps that have been met with reluctance by Kyiv's allies so far. The White House on Wednesday declined to comment about the plan. 'We're going to let the Ukrainians speak to their victory plan,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. 'What we're going to continue to do is show our support for the Ukrainians on the battlefield as they continue to beat back Russia.' Zelenskyy said in a statement following the call he also spoke to Biden about the U.S. and Ukraine potentially exploring ways to produce weapons together. The Biden administration also announced a further $425 million in military assistance to Ukraine, bringing its total to more than $64 billion in the two and a half years since Russia's invasion. Wednesday's package includes surface-to-air missiles to protect Ukrainian infrastructure from Russian attacks and long range rockets and artillery to help its war effort. Biden and Scholz recently spoke by phone to discuss the need for the countries to 'continue our strong collaboration on geopolitical priorities, including supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression,' according to the White House. Jean-Pierre said the trip was important to Biden, in part because of Germany's help with a complicated hostage swap with Russia. 'The president really wanted to make sure to go to Germany to thank Chancellor Scholz directly,' she said. Scholz in a speech before the German parliament on Wednesday said he was looking forward to Biden's visit. 'I would like to say that … President Biden stands for an incredible improvement in cooperation over recent years,' said Scholz, adding that he was grateful for the 'good collaboration' forged with the Democratic president. There's a significant measure of anxiety in Europe about what next month's U.S. presidential election could mean for Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has been in lockstep with Biden about the need to maintain robust economic and military support for Ukraine. Republican Donald Trump has said he would move to quickly to end the war the war with Russia should he regain the White House. Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has said that the plan would include establishing a 'demilitarized zone' and that Ukraine would not reclaim territory that Russia occupies and would agree not to join NATO. Scholz has been one of Biden's closest global allies. In addition to his robust support for Ukraine, Scholz played a critical role in helping free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, corporate security executive Paul Whelan, and others from Russian prisons in a multinational prisoner swap. As part of the biggest prisoner exchange in post-Soviet history, Scholz agreed to release Vadim Krasikov, a Russian who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Biden has not visited Africa since taking office in early 2021. Jean-Pierre said the coming visit to Luanda aims to 'recognize Angola's role as a strategic partner and regional leader, and discuss increased collaboration on security, health, and economic partnerships.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-travel-to-germany-this-week-angola-in-december-for-visits-delayed-by-hurricane-milton/7824926.html	2024-10-16T13:19:37-07:00	
US Navy fighter jet with two on board crashes during training in Washington state	The U.S. Navy searched Wednesday through mountainous terrain for two crew members who were aboard a fighter jet that crashed in Washington state during a routine training flight. The EA-18G Growler jet from the Electronic Attack Squadron crashed east of Mount Rainier at about 3:23 p.m. Tuesday, according to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. Search teams, including a U.S. Navy MH-60S helicopter, launched from NAS Whidbey Island to try to find the crew and examine the crash site. Navy searchers were joined by Yakima County tribal and local authorities as they pored over an area of about 48 kilometers (30 miles) west of Yakima in cloudy weather with low visibility, the Navy said. As of late Wednesday morning, they hadn't found the wreckage or crew, officials said in a news release. Navy officials said they didn't know if the two crew members managed to eject before the crash, which remains under investigation. The EA-18G Growler is similar to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and includes sophisticated electronic warfare devices. Most of the Growler squadrons are based at Whidbey Island. One squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. The 'Zappers' were recently deployed on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. The search Wednesday was happening in rainy and cloudy weather near Mount Rainier, a towering active volcano that is blanketed in snowfields and glaciers year-round. The first production of the Growler was delivered to Whidbey Island in 2008. In the last 15 years, it has operated around the globe supporting major actions, the Navy said. The plane seats a pilot in front and an electronics operator behind them. 'The EA-18G Growler aircraft we fly represents the most advanced technology in airborne Electronic Attack and stands as the Navy's first line of defense in hostile environments,' the Navy said on its website. Each aircraft costs about $67 million. Military aircraft training exercises and travel can be dangerous and sometimes result in crashes, injuries and deaths. In May, an F-35 fighter jet on its way from Texas to Edwards Air Force Base near Los Angeles crashed after the pilot stopped to refuel in New Mexico. The pilot was the only person on board in that case and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. Last year, eight U.S. Air Force special Operations Command service members were killed when a CV-22B Osprey aircraft they were flying in crashed off the coast of Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-fighter-jet-with-two-on-board-crashes-during-training-in-washington-state-/7824904.html	2024-10-16T13:19:29-07:00	
Defense contractor to pay $252M penalty to resolve Qatar bribery charges	NEW YORK — RTX Corporation, the defense contractor formerly known as Raytheon, has agreed to pay the U.S. government $252 million to resolve criminal charges alleging it paid bribes to secure contracts with Qatar, federal prosecutors said Wednesday. The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of violating the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corruption Practices Act and the Arms Export Control Act. It also agreed to pay a $52.5 million civil penalty to resolve a parallel Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and must forfeit at least $37 million to satisfy both probes. At a brief hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, lawyers for RTX waived their right to an indictment and pleaded not guilty to both counts. They did not object to any of the allegations in court documents filed in conjunction with the agreement. Under the agreement, the company will have to demonstrate good conduct for the next 3½ years and foster a culture of ethics and compliance with anti-corruption laws. Messages seeking comment were left for RTX Corporation and the Qatari Embassy in Washington. RTX said in a July regulatory filing that it set aside $1.24 billion to resolve pending legal and regulatory matters. The company's president and CEO, Christopher Calio, told investors that the investigations largely involved issues that predated the Raytheon-United Technologies merger that formed the current company in 2020. 'These matters primarily arose out of legacy Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins prior to the merger and acquisition of these companies,' Calio said. 'We've already taken robust corrective actions to address the legacy gaps that led to these issues.' According to court documents, Raytheon employees and agents offered and paid bribes to a foreign official between 2012 and 2016 to gain an advantage in obtaining lucrative business deals with the Qatar Emiri Air Force and Qatar Armed Forces. The company then succeeded in securing four additions to an existing contract with the Gulf Cooperation Council — a regional union of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — and a $510 million sole-sourced contract to build a joint-operations center for the Qatari military, the court documents said. Raytheon made about $36.7 million in profit from the Gulf Cooperation Council contract additions and anticipated making more than $72 million on the joint operations center, but the Qatari government ultimately did not go forward with the deal, prosecutors said. Wednesday's penalty is just the latest legal fallout from RTX's business dealings. According to court and regulatory filings, the company is expected to soon enter into another deferred prosecution agreement to resolve civil and criminal investigations in Massachusetts into defective pricing claims for Raytheon contracts dating from 2011 to 2017. In August, the company agreed to pay $200 million to the State Department after voluntarily disclosing more than two dozen alleged violations of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Among the allegations were that the company provided classified military aircraft data to China and that employees took company-issued laptops containing information about missiles and aircraft into Iran, Lebanon and Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/defense-contractor-to-pay-252m-penalty-to-resolve-qatar-bribery-charges/7824918.html	2024-10-16T13:13:16-07:00	
Listeria recall grows to 5.4 million kilograms of meat and poultry	A nationwide recall of meat and poultry products potentially contaminated with listeria has expanded to nearly 15.4 million kilograms (12 million pounds) and now includes ready-to-eat meals sent to U.S. schools, restaurants and major retailers, federal officials said. The updated recall includes prepared salads, burritos and other foods sold at stores including Costco, Trader Joe's, Target, Walmart and Kroger. The meat used in those products was processed at a Durant, Oklahoma, manufacturing plant operated by BrucePac. The Woodburn, Oregon-based company sells precooked meat and poultry to industrial, foodservice and retail companies across the country. Routine testing found potentially dangerous listeria bacteria in samples of BrucePac chicken, officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department said. No illnesses have been confirmed in connection with the recall, USDA officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not launched an outbreak investigation, a spokesperson said. The recall, issued on October 9, includes foods produced between May 31 and October 8. The USDA has posted a 342-page list of hundreds of potentially affected foods, including chicken wraps sold at Trader Joe's, chicken burritos sold at Costco and many types of salads sold at stores such as Target and Walmart. The foods were also sent to school districts and restaurants across the country. The recalled foods can be identified by establishment numbers '51205 or P-51205' inside or under the USDA mark of inspection. Consumers can search on the USDA recall site to find potentially affected products. Such foods should be thrown away or returned to stores for refunds, officials said. Eating foods contaminated with listeria can cause potentially serious illness. About 1,600 people are infected with listeria bacteria each year in the U.S. and about 260 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria infections typically cause fever, muscle aches and tiredness and may cause stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Symptoms can occur quickly or to up to 10 weeks after eating contaminated food. The infections are especially dangerous for older people, those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant. The same type of bacteria is responsible for an outbreak tied to Boar's Head deli meat that has killed at least 10 people since May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/listeria-recall-grows-to-5-4-million-kilograms-of-meat-and-poultry/7824872.html	2024-10-16T12:42:25-07:00	
Two US radio stations end Russian-backed 'propaganda' programming	Washington — Russian-backed radio programmer Sputnik no longer broadcasts in the Washington market after years of criticism that its local radio station, WZHF, carries antisemitic content and false information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Political cartoonist Ted Rall, who described himself as a guest on Sputnik’s programming, posted a comment Tuesday on X: 'Biden/Harris say they're fighting for democracy. Yet: today Sputnik News US is being forced to shut down today due to Biden/Harris sanctions. My radio show and cartoons for them are being quashed. So are the other amazing shows. I go off the air with the station at noon.' Manila Chan, a self-described indie journalist, tweeted Tuesday that she and Rall would be relaunching their show on YouTube 'following sanctions that have shut down RT+Sputnik.' As first reported by The Desk, a news website on the business of streaming media, Sputnik stopped programming in its Washington-based market and three stations in the Kansas City, Missouri, area this week. Last month, the U.S. State Department introduced new sanctions on Russian-backed broadcasters, including television channel RT, for fundraising on behalf of the Russian military in opposition to Ukraine. The sanctions marked the first time the United States accused Russian broadcasters of providing direct and material military support. 'RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden. Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month. The sanctions did not specifically prohibit the content of the programming but made it more difficult for Sputnik to continue buying airtime on U.S. stations. 'As Foreign Missions Act-designated entities, Rossiya Segodnya, RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik will be required to notify the State Department of all personnel working in the United States. The entities will also be required to disclose all real property they hold within the United States,' said the State Department in a September 4 statement. RT and RT America, the TV and digital media company founded by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2005, directs Sputnik. Prior to this week, five U.S. radio stations carried Russian government-backed Sputnik programming. Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the National Association of Broadcasters said in a statement, 'While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, however, it does not prevent private actors from exercising sound, moral judgment. To that end, given the unprovoked aggression exhibited by Russia against the free and sovereign people of Ukraine, NAB calls on broadcasters to cease carrying any state-sponsored programming with ties to the Russian government or its agents.' 'While we know that airings of such programs are extremely limited, we believe that our nation must stand fully united against misinformation and for freedom and democracy across the globe,' said NAB. In January, Republican Representative Jack Bergman called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke the license of Radio Sputnik Washington affiliate WZHF (1390) and its translator W288BS at 105.5 FM. In the letter, Bergman cited a steady stream of antisemitic tropes and false information about the war in Ukraine. 'An FCC licensee clearly has a First Amendment right to broadcast. However, that right is tempered by its obligation to broadcast programming that is in the public interest and responsive to the needs of the local community,' Bergman wrote in the letter. He also argued the licensees 'have made no effort to ascertain the needs or interests of the local community' and that their programming decisions 'are based exclusively on monetary considerations.' In 2018, three Democratic members of Congress asked then-FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to investigate Sputnik’s alleged efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 'In Washington, D.C., listeners need only tune their radios to 105.5 FM to hear the Russian government’s effort to influence U.S. policy,' the letter from Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo, Mike Doyle and Frank Pallone said. 'Disturbingly, this means the Kremlin’s propaganda messages are being broadcast over a license granted by the FCC.' Pai — a Trump administration appointee — declined to investigate, saying the First Amendment prevented the FCC 'from interfering with a broadcast licensee’s choice of programming, even if that programming may be objectionable to many listeners.' A bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced the Identifying Propaganda on Our Airwaves Act in 2018. 'Foreign governments shouldn’t be able to hide behind shell companies to fund misinformation and propaganda on American airwaves,' said Democratic Senator Brian Schatz, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 'By giving the FCC the authority to require disclosure of this foreign propaganda, our bipartisan bill will help stop this practice and improve programming transparency on TV and the radio,' he said. The bill did not advance in Congress. Federal regulations already prevent foreign governments from holding U.S. broadcast licenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-us-radio-stations-end-russian-backed-propaganda-programming/7824863.html	2024-10-16T12:34:00-07:00

Trudeau calls India's alleged interference in Canada 'horrific mistake'	OTTAWA, CANADA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made 'a horrific mistake' by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada's sovereignty. Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country. The Canadian leader's comments were the strongest he has made in a yearlong dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low. 'The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,' he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics. Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians' security but declined to give details. India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trudeau-calls-india-s-alleged-interference-in-canada-horrific-mistake-/7824810.html	2024-10-16T11:51:27-07:00	
Former US president Jimmy Carter, 100, casts vote	washington — Fifteen days after turning 100, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter cast his ballot in the U.S. election on Wednesday, fulfilling an earlier declared wish to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris. The former Democratic leader 'voted by mail,' according to the Carter Center, the nonprofit he founded after he left the White House in 1981 to pursue his vision of world diplomacy. The centenarian — who left office under a cloud of unpopularity, but has seen his star rise ever since — took advantage of early voting in his home state of Georgia, where he is receiving hospice care. Carter had told his family earlier this year that living long enough to vote for Harris and help defeat her Republican rival, Donald Trump, was more important to him than his centennial, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. He reached both milestones. More than 420,000 people have cast their ballot since early voting began Tuesday in Georgia, according to Gabriel Sterling, a state election official who posted the figures at midday. Election Day is November 5. Carter, a one-term president, has been receiving end-of-life care in his hometown of Plains in Georgia since February last year. He is the first former U.S. president to reach the century mark, another extraordinary milestone for the one-time peanut farmer who worked his way to the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-100-casts-vote-/7824686.html	2024-10-16T10:37:02-07:00

Israeli minister criticizes Macron over France defense show ban	Jerusalem — Israeli delegations taking part in the major defense show Euronaval in France next month will not be permitted to set up a stand or exhibit hardware following a decision by the French government, organizers said Wednesday, prompting outrage from Israel. The decision comes as tensions are rising between Israel and France following comments by President Emmanuel Macron criticizing the civilian casualties in the Israeli campaigns against Shiite militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The French leader last week insisted that stopping the export of weapons used by Israel in both operations was the only way to halt the two conflicts. 'The French government informed Euronaval of its decision to approve the participation of Israeli delegations at Euronaval 2024, without any stand or exhibition of equipment,' said the organizers of the show which is due to start on November 4 in Paris. Following the decision, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant slammed Macron, calling the move a 'disgrace'. 'Macron's actions are a disgrace to the French nation and the values of the free world, which he claims to uphold. The decision to discriminate against Israeli defense industries in France a second time - aids Israel's enemies during war,' Gallant said in a post on X. 'We will continue defending our nation against enemies on 7 different fronts, and fighting for our future - with or without France,' Gallant added. Euronaval, a biennial event that attracts naval defense exhibitors from around the world, said seven Israeli companies are affected by the decision. 'In accordance with the French government's decision, Israeli companies and citizens who wish to attend will be welcomed at the show under the conditions listed above,' it added. At the end of May, the presence of Israeli defense manufacturers at the Eurosatory land defense and security exhibition was banned by the government, before finally being authorized by the French courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-minister-criticizes-macron-over-france-defense-show-ban/7824606.html	2024-10-16T09:51:57-07:00	
Mozambique’s ruling party candidate poised for presidential victory	Maputo — Daniel Chapo, the presidential candidate of Mozambique’s ruling party, is comfortably leading the vote count in nine of the country's provinces and appears set to become the country’s next president. His closest challenger was running a distant second Wednesday as vote counting from last week’s election continued. Preliminary results from Wednesday’s election announced so far show Chapo leading with over 50% of the vote in nine of Mozambique’s 11 provinces. In the capital, Maputo, Chapo is ahead with over 53 percent, followed by independent candidate Venancio Mondlane at just under 34 percent. Chapo has led at every polling station counted, according to the chairperson of the Maputo Provincial Election Commission, Lucilia Sitoe. She said, 'Daniel Franscisco Chapo, 656,056, which corresponds to 68.02. Venancio Antion Bila Mondlane, 260,792, which corresponds to 27.04%.' The two other presidential candidates, Ossufo Momade of the opposition Renamo party, polled 9.6% of the vote in Maputo, followed by Lutero Simango of Mozambique Democratic Movement, MDM with 2.86%. A similar scenario is also occurring in the central province of Zambezia, traditionally an opposition stronghold. There, Chapo is leading with 73%, with Mondlane a distant second with 14.7%. In Sofala province, another longtime opposition stronghold, Chapo held 65% of the vote. Turnout in Wednesday’s election was relatively low, less than 50%. According to data shared by electoral bodies, close to 9 million of Mozambique’s 17 million registered voters did not vote. In the northern province of Nampula, the largest constituency in the country, more than 2 million voters stayed home and tens of thousands cast blank ballots – a common form of protest in Mozambique, showing dissatisfaction with all the candidates. The numbers were similar in Zambezia, the country’s second-largest constituency. In Cabo Delgado province, plagued by an insurgency by Islamist militants for several years, 925,000 people did not vote, 35,000 cast blank ballots and another 18,000 votes were spoiled. The chairman of Mozambique’s national elections commission vowed that every ballot cast will be counted. He said, 'Every vote will be counted definitely, we are ready for that. The counting system is participatory because all the political parties are represented at polling stations so every vote will count and we just hope for the best.' Final results are expected in about two weeks. Independent political analyst Dercio Alfazema said the next president faces high expectations from the public. 'Our expectations are number one, is to be well governed, so we have a challenge to obtain a better result, the people want the end of corruption, we are looking for more security, we are looking for more health service and the quality of education, the extension of the services such as infrastructure. We also have the problem of terrorism in the north, the kidnappings; the young people are looking for jobs and some opportunities,' said Alfazema. The president-elect will be sworn into office in January, when current President Filipe Nyusi, who is barred by the constitution from running again, steps down at the end of his second five-year term.

EU, Gulf leaders meet for first summit as Mideast turmoil churns	BRUSSELS — The leaders of the European Union and six Gulf nations met for an inaugural summit on Wednesday against a backdrop of turmoil in the Middle East and struggles to find a unified position on the war in Ukraine and relations with Russia. The summit was expected to last just a few hours and encompass topics ranging from visas and trade to the situation in the Middle East. It was unlikely to yield more than general commitments to improve cooperation. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said that the summit was 'long overdue' and that 'the economic ties between the European Union and the Gulf countries need to be strengthened.' 'They are there, but they have the potential to be developed much, much further,' he said. Officials said the EU would also raise human rights issues with their visitors, which include Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The United States, United Nations and others have alleged that aides of Mohammed and other Saudi officials killed U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose columns for The Washington Post were critical of the crown prince. 'Our outrage and revulsion at this horrific violation of human rights cannot be set aside for the sake of quick deals with dictators. EU leaders must confront brutal authoritarianism wherever it exists,' EU Greens legislator Daniel Freund said. The 27-nation EU has long had relations with the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council of Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait. The nations of the European Union already find it challenging to find full alignment on Israel's wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, and it will be difficult to find a strong common statement with GCC leaders, officials familiar with the meeting said. EU members are also in disagreement regarding relations with Russia and Ukraine, with nations such as Hungary and Slovakia holding vastly different views on Moscow's actions than much of the other EU states. At the same time, several GCC nations have much better contact with Moscow compared to EU members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-gulf-leaders-meet-for-first-summit-as-mideast-turmoil-churns/7824518.html	2024-10-16T08:49:54-07:00

European airlines voice concern over Chinese counterparts 'unfair advantages'	Calls are growing among European airline carriers to address what they say is an unfair advantage enjoyed by their Chinese counterparts, who can fly directly over Russia to Europe and offer customers shorter travel times and cheaper ticket prices. Many European carriers have been banned from Russia's airspace in response to sanctions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Additional environmental costs make it harder for European airlines to compete against Chinese carriers. Speaking at an industry press conference on Wednesday in Brussels, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr urged changes that would require all flights into Europe to avoid Russian airspace. 'We are not allowed to cross Russia but Chinese carriers are. If you want a level playing field, we need to ensure any airline landing in Europe avoids Russian airspace. Until that happens there will be enormous advantages to Chinese carriers,' Spohr said, according to Reuters. Bloomberg reported that according to sources familiar with the matter, Air-France KLM, a Paris-headquartered airline group, is lobbying the French government to add a cap to the number of flights to Europe from Chinese carriers to protect European airlines from unfair competition. Earlier this month, Marjan Rintel, CEO of KLM, called on Europe to take measures against what she said is an unlevel playing field, when speaking with Dutch public broadcaster Nederlandse Publieke Omroep, or NPO. 'Europe can at least look at how we can prevent that unfair playing field by pricing it or looking at it in a different way,' Rintel said. European airlines have not flown over Russian territory since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukraine’s airspace has also been closed. The remarks from Lufthansa’s CEO are not the first time that flights from China have aroused concerns from other countries. During the COVID pandemic, the United States took action to limit the number of Chinese airlines flying into the country which ultimately resulted in both Washington and Beijing creating caps on flight numbers. Some European airlines have already canceled routes to China. Later this month, Lufthansa will cancel its Frankfurth to Beijing flight and Air China will become the sole airline flying between the two cities. In July, Virgin Atlantic canceled its London to Shanghai flight, its only route to China. The EU and China have been at odds over various issues regarding trade, technology and national security in recent years. Some fear recent tit-for-tat actions between China and the EU could lead to a trade war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-airlines-voice-concern-over-chinese-counterparts-unfair-advantages-/7824457.html	2024-10-16T07:51:24-07:00	
Nebraska's high court says people with felony records can register to vote	OMAHA, Neb. — Nebraska's top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election. In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences. Evnen's order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska's Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play. In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins. Given the Omaha district's history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups. The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is Oct. 25 and must be done in person at a voter's county election commission office. Election Day is Nov. 5. Hilgers' opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons. Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans. The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences. The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen's directive. Because Evnen's move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed. Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote. In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights. Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU. Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nebraska-s-high-court-says-people-with-felony-records-can-register-to-vote/7824406.html	2024-10-16T07:25:24-07:00

Pakistan pushes for expansion of China’s BRI plans	Islamabad — Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif advocated expanding China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on Wednesday, saying it would enhance regional trade cooperation and promote 'the vision of a connected Eurasia.' He delivered the remarks at the annual heads of government meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Islamabad. Beijing and Russia established the SCO in 2001 as a way to counterbalance Western alliances in the areas of security, politics, and economics. In his inaugural speech to the SCO huddle, Sharif hailed China’s investments in infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, and called for its expansion. 'Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor…should be expanded, focusing on developing road, rail, and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region,' he stated. 'Let us not look at such projects through the narrow political prism, and [instead] invest in our collective connectivity capacities, which are crucial to advancing the shared vision of an economically integrated region,' Sharif asserted, noting that 40% of the world’s population lives in SCO member countries. Beijing launched the ambitious $1 trillion BRI, a global infrastructure and energy network, a decade ago to connect Asia, Africa, and Europe through new land and maritime routes. The United States and other Western critics see the plan as a tool for China to expand its geopolitical and economic influence. They also criticize the Chinese investments, alleging they are burdening developing countries with unsustainable debt, charges Beijing rejects as politically motivated. Last year, through the G7 framework, Western nations unveiled a $600 billion initiative to establish an alternative infrastructure development plan for connectivity. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, known as CPEC, is a key BRI extension into Pakistan, building road networks, mostly coal-fired power plants and a deep-water port as well as an airport in the coastal city of Gwadar. Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin were among the leaders from the 10-member grouping who attended Wednesday’s gathering, including host Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and Iran. An official Chinese statement quoted Premier Li as stating during the SCO gathering in Islamabad that China 'looks forward to working with all parties' to implement the outcomes of summits and 'deepen cooperation in various fields, and promote the cohesion of the SCO, so as to make greater contributions to advancing regional peace, stability, and development.' Analysts remain skeptical whether the SCO meetings have produced outcomes that would address the needs of member states, noting that Western alliances like NATO or the European Union offer members privileges such as mutual defense and economic integration. Afghanistan Pakistani authorities placed Islamabad under a security lockdown for the SCO meeting, deploying around 10,000 security forces, including troops, in and around the city to protect the high-profile event due to a recent surge in deadly militant attacks. Islamabad says fugitives linked to anti-Pakistan terrorist groups orchestrate the violence from sanctuaries in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Sharif used his speech Wednesday to press the Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, to address regional terrorism concerns, noting that stability in Afghanistan was essential for SCO member states to realize regional connectivity and trade opportunities fully. 'While the international community must extend the needed assistance to help the Afghan interim government in staving off the humanitarian crisis and preventing an economic meltdown, it must also demand from the Afghan Interim government to take concrete measures to promote political inclusivity, as well as to ensure that its soil is not used for terrorism against its neighbors, by any entity,' he stated. Militant and separatist attacks have claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Pakistani civilians and security forces so far this year alone. Last week, two Chinese engineers were killed and another was injured when a suicide car bombing hit their convoy in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. The slain Chinese nationals were staff at a CPEC-built power plant. The Taliban have repeatedly denied charges that foreign militants are using Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries. They also dismissed international calls for giving representation to all ethnic and political groups in Afghanistan in their administration, called the Islamic Emirate. The Tabliban say they are governing the country in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-pushes-for-expansion-of-china-s-bri-plans/7824296.html	2024-10-16T06:17:32-07:00	
China says unidentified foreign company conducted illegal mapping services	BEIJING — China's state security ministry said that a foreign company had been found to have illegally conducted geographic mapping activities in the country under the guise of autonomous driving research and outsourcing to a licensed Chinese mapping firm. The ministry did not disclose the names of either company in a statement on its WeChat account on Wednesday. The foreign company, ineligible for geographic surveying and mapping activities in China, 'purchased a number of cars and equipped them with high-precision radar, GPS, optical lenses and other gear,' read the statement. In addition to directly instructing the Chinese company to conduct surveying and mapping in many Chinese provinces, the foreign company appointed foreign technicians to give 'practical guidance' to mapping staffers with the Chinese firm, enabling the latter to transfer its acquired data overseas, the ministry alleged. Most of the data the foreign company has collected have been determined to be state secrets, according to the ministry, which said state security organs, together with relevant departments, had carried out joint law enforcement activities. The affected companies and relevant responsible personnel have been held legally accountable, the state security ministry said, without elaborating. China has strictly regulated mapping activities and data, which are key to developing autonomous driving, due to national security concerns. No foreign firm is qualified for mapping in China and data collected by vehicles made by foreign automakers such as Tesla in China has to be stored locally. The U.S. Commerce Department has also proposed prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns. Also on Wednesday, a Chinese cybersecurity industry group recommended that Intel products sold in China should be subject to a security review, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has 'constantly harmed' the country's national security and interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-unidentified-foreign-company-conducted-illegal-mapping-services-/7824277.html	2024-10-16T05:59:17-07:00	
US police urged to embrace prevention to head off mass shootings, attacks	The U.S. agency charged with protecting the life of the president of the United States and other high-ranking officials wants state and local law enforcement to do more to stop potential threats from escalating into violence. And it is trying to show police agencies across the country exactly how to do it. The U.S. Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) on Wednesday issued a new guide, encouraging law enforcement agencies to create specific units to address threatening behavior in cases where there are significant concerns, even though no laws have been broken. The guide specifically calls for police agencies to set up what NTAC calls behavioral threat assessment units that can assess potential dangers and then provide resources to make sure individuals get help before they resort to violence. 'What our research has continuously found is that in many cases of mass violence or other forms of targeted violence, the attacker's behavior was witnessed by community bystanders, some of whom sought to report their concerns to public safety officials,' said Lina Alathari, NTAC director, briefing reporters ahead of the guide's release. 'Unfortunately, many communities lack the structured systems to receive, evaluate and respond to these reports in a way that would reduce the likelihood of a violent or tragic outcome,' she said. NTAC's plea for law enforcement agencies to find ways to be more proactive is not new. A January 2023 report that analyzed 173 mass attacks carried out over a five-year period urged communities to make it easier for witnesses to report concerns and allow for earlier intervention from crisis counselors and social services. But the latest guidance comes as national security officials are bracing for potential violence. The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 annual threat assessment, issued last month, warned, 'The terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high. 'The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors,' it added. The Secret Service has itself responded to two unrelated attempts to assassinate former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, coming under criticism for its failure to prevent one of the would-be assassins from firing eight shots and injuring Trump before he was stopped. Investigators in that case have said the now dead 20-year-old gunman had spent months researching assassinations and saw the former president as a 'target of opportunity.' The new guide, issued Wednesday, aims to show police agencies how to spot warning signs more quickly and find ways to intervene. 'We have seen historically that law enforcement in the United States may at times feel limited in what they can do when responding to reports of threats or other concerning behavior, particularly when that behavior does not involve criminal activity,' said NTAC Assistant Chief Steven Driscoll. 'This publication represents the most comprehensive guidance ever produced on how to adapt and operationalize the Secret Services Behavioral Threat Assessment model for use by state and local law enforcement agencies,' he said. Some state law enforcement agencies have already adopted the Secret Service model. North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation set up a behavioral analysis threat assessment unit following a 2018 shooting that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. The unit works with other state agencies and the state's university system to prevent potential attacks. The state of Hawaii has likewise created a team to intervene in cases of potential violence. And there is a similar program in Washington, the U.S. capital. 'Behavioral threat assessment methodology has been proven effective in safeguarding community time and again,' Driscoll said. 'Prevention happens successfully every day, and thankfully, these are stories that we never hear about, when everybody goes home safely.' As an example, Driscoll pointed to a 2021 NTAC study that looked at 67 incidents in which attacks on schools were averted due to students and community members reporting warning signs so authorities could intervene before anyone got hurt. Despite such successes, NTAC said it does not have any data on how many communities have behavioral threat assessment units. And officials worry that too many state and local law enforcement agencies lack access to programs that allow them to step in when a threat has been identified but no law has been broken. Some federal funding, though, is available. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it has awarded almost $90 million through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program since 2020. And NTAC's Alathari said the specialized units can be effective, even when people and resources are scarce. 'Behavioral assessment units are able to vary in size,' she said in response to a question from VOA. 'An agency with limited resources to establish this kind of unit could begin with just a single designated violence prevention officer who maintains the responsibility of gathering information, information to manage situations that might revolve around potential violence.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-police-urged-to-embrace-prevention-to-head-off-mass-shootings-attacks-/7824207.html	2024-10-16T04:59:09-07:00	
Impeachment proceedings against Kenyan deputy president are constitutional, court says	NAIROBI — Kenya's senate began impeachment hearings against Kenya's deputy president on Wednesday, hours after a court said the proceedings were constitutional, clearing the way for a vote on his dismissal this week. Kenya's National Assembly voted on Tuesday last week to impeach the deputy president, Rigathi Gachagua, on 11 charges which included corruption, undermining the government and stirring ethnic hatred. Gachagua has denied all charges. Gachagua has said the impeachment motion, backed by opposition lawmakers and allies of President William Ruto, was based on falsehoods that constituted a political lynching, according to court documents seen by Reuters. As the senate opened proceedings on Wednesday, Gachagua denied the 11 charges read out by senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye. 'Not guilty,' Gachagua said in response to each one. Gachagua had launched a legal challenge against the impeachment proceedings in the high court, but Judge Erick Ogolla said the process could go ahead. 'At this stage, the process is a lawful, constitutional process, and the Senate will conduct a trial where all the issues being raised before the court will be raised and determined at the moment,' the judge said in court. 'The application at this stage is premature and anticipatory,' he said, referring to Gachagua's legal challenge. The deputy president was Ruto's running mate in their 2022 election win, helping secure vital votes from the populous central Kenya region. But the men have since fallen out and political alliances have shifted. Ruto fired most of his Cabinet and appointed members of the opposition to what he called a unity government after nationwide protests against tax increases in which more than 50 people were killed. During Wednesday's session, members of parliament seeking Gachagua's removal are expected to present their case to the senators. Gachagua is expected to defend himself on Thursday before the vote. A two-thirds majority would be needed to dismiss him. The court also said it would decide on Oct. 29 whether Ruto can nominate a new deputy if Gachagua is dismissed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-proceedings-against-kenyan-deputy-president-are-constitutional-court-says/7824186.html	2024-10-16T04:20:59-07:00	
Italy delivers first migrants to Albania under new deal	SHENGJIN, Albania — A ship carrying the first group of migrants to be processed in Albania under a deal with Italy arrived in the port of Shengjin on Wednesday morning, setting in motion Rome's controversial plan to process thousands of asylum seekers abroad. Italy has built two reception centers in Albania, in the first scheme by a European Union nation to divert migrants to a non-E.U. country. The plan aims to deter irregular arrivals to Italy, but has been criticized by rights groups who say it restricts migrants' right to asylum. The Libra, an Italian navy ship, docked at Shengjin, Reuters footage showed. Sixteen migrants were escorted into a newly built processing center at the port, which was ringed by a high metal fence and adorned with Italian and E.U. flags. Rising tension in Europe over migration issues has seen many E.U. nations, including Germany and Poland, propose or adopt tougher policies. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said this week that her country was setting an example for the rest of Europe with the Albanian scheme. A small group of protesters gathered at the port on Wednesday. 'The European dream ends here,' one banner read. 'These immigrants who have done long, dangerous journeys to make it to Europe are now rerouting to Albania so that they will go back to their home countries... It's ending for us [the concept of] Europe as a place of democracy, of values, of human rights,' said Arilda Lleshi, an Albanian human rights activist. The group of migrants taken to Albania comprised 10 Bangladeshis and six Egyptians who were picked up at sea on Sunday aboard boats that had set sail from Libya. After processing in Shengjin, they will be taken inland to the village of Gjader, a 15-minute drive away, where they will be accommodated until their papers are finalized. They will then be sent to Italy if their asylum request is granted, or sent to their home country if rejected. The facilities in Shengjin and Gjader will be staffed by Italian personnel. Under the deal, the total number of migrants present at one time in Albania cannot be more than 3,000. Italy has said only 'non-vulnerable' men coming from countries classified as safe would be sent to Albania, to a limit of 36,000 migrants a year. At present there are 21 such nations on the Italian list. Last year, 56,588 migrants arrived in Italy from just four of them — Bangladesh, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Tunisia. Most abscond from reception centers and head to wealthier northern Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-delivers-first-migrants-to-albania-under-new-deal-/7824147.html	2024-10-16T03:52:41-07:00	
Nigeria fuel tanker explosion kills almost 100	Kano, Nigeria — A fuel tanker explosion in northern Nigeria has killed almost 100 people and left 50 injured, police said on Wednesday. Many of the victims had been trying to collect fuel spilt on the road after the tanker crashed in northern Jigawa state late on Tuesday, police spokesman Lawan Shiisu Adam told AFP. The tanker had veered to avoid colliding with a truck in the town of Majia, he said. 'We have so far confirmed 94 people dead and around 50 injured,' he said, warning the death toll could rise. Following the crash, residents crowded around the vehicle, collecting fuel that had spilt on the road and in drains, Adam said. He said the residents had 'overwhelmed' officers trying to stop them. The Nigerian Medical Association has urged doctors to rush to nearby emergency rooms to help with the influx of patients. Fuel tanker explosions are common in Africa's most populous nation, where roads can be poorly maintained and residents often look to siphon off fuel following accidents. Fuel has become an even more precious commodity as Nigeria suffers its worst economic crisis in a generation. The price of petrol has soared fivefold since President Bola Ahmed Tinubu scrapped subsidies last year, and there are often shortages. Desperation rose further last week after the state oil company hiked prices for the second time in just over a month. Dangerous roads Accidents involving tankers are frequent in the country, with the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) recording 1,531 in 2020, causing 535 deaths. Last month, at least 59 people died when a fuel tanker collided with a truck carrying passengers and cattle in northwestern Niger state. The FRSC said more than 5,000 people died in road accidents in Nigeria in 2023, compared to nearly 6,500 the previous year. But according to the World Health Organization, the figures do not include accidents that are not reported to the authorities. It estimates annual road accident deaths in Nigeria to be closer to 40,000, it said in a report published last year. Deadly fires and explosions also take place across fuel and oil infrastructure in Nigeria, one of the continent's largest crude producers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-fuel-tanker-explosion-kills-almost-100-/7824153.html	2024-10-16T03:52:16-07:00	
Chinese cyber association calls for review of Intel products sold in China	BEIJING — Intel products sold in China should be subject to a security review, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) said on Wednesday, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has 'constantly harmed' the country's national security and interests. While CSAC is an industry group rather than a government body, it has close ties to the Chinese state and the raft of accusations against Intel, published in a long post on its official WeChat group, could trigger a security review from China's powerful cyberspace regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). 'It is recommended that a network security review is initiated on the products Intel sells in China, so as to effectively safeguard China's national security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese consumers,' CSAC said. Last year, the CAC barred domestic operators of key infrastructure from buying products made by U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc after deeming the company's products had failed its network security review. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company's shares were down 2.7% in U.S. premarket trading.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-cyber-association-calls-for-review-of-intel-products-sold-in-china-/7824133.html	2024-10-16T03:22:01-07:00	
Saudi cartoonist gets 23-year prison sentence: rights group	Dubai, United Arab Emirates — A Saudi artist has been sentenced to more than two decades in prison over political cartoons that allegedly insulted the Gulf kingdom's leadership, his sister and a rights group said this week. The case against Mohammed al-Hazza, 48, adds to concerns about freedom of expression under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest crude oil exporter -- seeks to open up to tourists and investors after years of isolation. The father of five was arrested in February 2018 in Saudi Arabia during 'a violent raid' in which security forces entered his home and ransacked his studio, the London-based Sanad Human Rights Organization said in a statement. A court document seen by AFP says the charges against him concern 'offensive cartoons' he produced for the Qatari newspaper Lusail as well as social media posts that were allegedly 'hostile' to Saudi Arabia and supportive of Qatar. Hazza's arrest came less than a year after Saudi Arabia and several allies cut ties with Qatar, claiming it supported extremists and was too close to Iran -- allegations that Doha denied. The countries mended ties in January 2021. Saudi Arabia's Specialized Criminal Court, set up in 2008 to deal with terrorism-related cases, initially sentenced Hazza to six years in prison. But this year, as Hazza was preparing to be released, the case was re-opened and he was sentenced to 23 years, his sister Asrar al-Hazza told AFP by phone from the United States. 'He was almost there... He almost left the prison. But then out of nowhere it was opened again and it was 23 years,' she said. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the case on Wednesday. Sanad said in its statement that Hazza worked for Lusail mostly before the 2017 boycott 'and only briefly afterward' and that most of his cartoons concerned domestic Qatari issues. The group said prosecutors failed to provide evidence of cartoons that were offensive to Saudi Arabia or social media posts that backed Qatar during the boycott. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia has been criticized for what activists describe as a fierce crackdown on even vaguely critical online speech. In the past two years the Saudi judiciary has 'convicted and handed down lengthy prison terms on dozens of individuals for their expression on social media,' human rights groups Amnesty International and ALQST said in April. Saudi officials say the accused committed terrorism-related offences. 'The case of Mohammed al-Hazza is one example of the suppression of freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia, which has not spared anyone, including artists,' Sanad operations manager Samer Alshumrani told AFP. 'This is supported by the politicized, non-independent judiciary in Saudi Arabia.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-cartoonist-gets-23-year-prison-sentence-rights-group/7824085.html	2024-10-16T01:49:35-07:00	
Georgia's leaders stoke fears of Russian war ahead of pivotal election	Tbilisi, Georgia — The Republic of Georgia, which was part of the Soviet Union until independence in 1991, is preparing for a crucial election on October 26 in a vote widely seen as a choice between a future aligned with the West or Russia. The United States and the European Union accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of backsliding on democracy and of tacking closer to Moscow, which party officials deny. Polls suggest Georgian Dream may struggle to win a parliamentary majority and retain power, although it's not clear if opposition parties would be able to form a coalition to oust the government. Fear of conflict With Russia's invasion of Ukraine looming over the election campaign, Georgian Dream has sought to shore up its support by capitalizing on voters' fears of renewed conflict with Moscow. Russian forces still occupy 20% of Georgian territory following their 2008 invasion of the country. Georgian Dream's election posters seek to present a stark choice for voters. On one side, there are photographs of the destruction from Russia's war on Ukraine; on the other, idyllic images of a prosperous Georgia. The captions read: 'No to war! Choose peace.' Georgian Dream accuses its rivals of being part of what it calls the 'global war party.' 'Since the war began, Georgian Dream's rhetoric has been based on the idea that they are the party of peace, while the opposition is the party of war,' said Ghia Nodia, a political analyst at Ilia State University in Tbilisi. 'They claim the opposition would drag the country into war with Russia and that the opposition is, in this sense, an agent of the West, part of the 'global war party.'' 'The fear of war exists in society, largely because of the experience of 2008. And in some ways, this message has been successful. But from my observations, this message has now worn out,' Nodia told VOA. 'Global war party' Opposition parties have expressed disgust at the Georgian Dream campaign. Several of the billboards and TV advertisements feature photographs of alleged Russian atrocities, such as the strike on the Mariupol theater in March 2022, which is thought to have killed several hundred civilians. Kyiv has described the images as 'unacceptable.' Georgian Dream stands by its campaign. 'What we have said is that some individuals — whether politicians, businesspeople, or other actors — might support ongoing wars, including entangling Georgia in war. No leader of Georgian Dream has ever labeled the EU, the U.S., or any Western nation as part of the global war party,' said Nikoloz Samkharadze, a member of Georgian Dream and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in parliament. West vs. Russia To many Georgians — including the country's president, Salome Zourabichvili, a critic of the government — the election presents a choice on Georgia's future path: Align with the West, or with Moscow. 'It's a choice about what kind of country we want to live in. The West represents democracy, while Russia stands for authoritarianism,' said analyst Nodia. Georgian Dream rejects accusations that it is seeking closer relations with Moscow. 'We sponsored multiple United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's aggression [on Ukraine]. We supported Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe due to the war. We co-sponsored similar resolutions in the OSCE, and we filed a lawsuit at the International Criminal Court on behalf of Ukraine against Russia for war crimes. 'All of this demonstrates Georgia's clear, principled diplomatic and legal stance on Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,' said Samkharadze. EU future Georgia's aspiration to join the EU is enshrined in the country's constitution. Polls suggest more than 80% of Georgians want to join the bloc. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December last year as part of an effort by Brussels to offer political support to former Soviet states in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But relations have soured fast. Brussels effectively froze membership talks after Georgia reintroduced a so-called foreign agent law in April, which the West says mimics Russian legislation used to clamp down on political opposition, civil society and free media. A violent crackdown on subsequent anti-government protests in Tbilisi prompted the U.S. and EU to impose sanctions on Georgian officials. EU lawmakers accuse the government of pivoting toward Russia and have called for the European Commission to impose sanctions on Georgian Dream's billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, along with other party officials. Speaking on Monday, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Georgia's EU accession process was 'de facto halted.' 'The ruling party's recent actions, statements and electoral promises take the country away from the European path and signals a shift towards authoritarianism,' Borrell told reporters following an EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg. Georgian Dream insists EU membership is still on track. 'It's crucial for us to prepare Georgia to become a member of the EU by 2030,' Samkharadze told VOA. 'I think these issues are temporary, and we can find common ground with both the EU and the U.S. on these matters, provided there's mutual will.' Coalition building For the first time, lawmakers will be elected by full proportional representation. Most opposition parties have united under four broad coalition blocs to ensure they exceed the 5% threshold required to avoid disqualification. Polls suggest no single party or bloc will gain a majority amid public distrust of the entire political class. Can the opposition coalesce to oust Georgian Dream? Giga Bokeria, a former secretary of the National Security Council and founder of the new Federalist Party, which is not taking part in the election, believes there is public and political will to force a change of government. 'A significant part of society has legitimate reasons to mistrust the political class, particularly certain representatives. This is a serious problem. But … I believe there are still more than enough arguments to build a consensus around the need to change the government, despite this mistrust,' Bokeria said. Election aftermath According to Ilia State University's Nodia, Georgian Dream stands little chance of winning 'in a free and fair election,' but there are concerns the party may not willingly relinquish power. 'There is still a fear within society that even if Georgian Dream loses, they won't recognize the results and will declare themselves the winners. I think this fear is exaggerated, but we can't say anything for sure,' Nodia said. Georgian Dream insists it will respect democracy. 'We will accept the people's decision, whatever it may be,' said Samkharadze. 'At the same time, I want to emphasize that we are confident the vast majority of Georgians will support Georgian Dream.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-leaders-stoke-fears-of-russian-war-ahead-of-pivotal-election-/7824081.html	2024-10-16T01:38:14-07:00	
Grand museum displaying Egypt's ancient treasures opens for trial run	CAIRO — The Grand Egyptian Museum will open 12 halls with exhibits about ancient Egypt in its main galleries starting this week in a trial run ahead of the still-unannounced official opening, officials said Tuesday. The museum, a mega-project near the famed Giza Pyramids which has cost well over $1 billion so far, will open the halls for 4,000 visitors per day starting Wednesday, said Al-Tayeb Abbas, assistant to the minister of antiquities. The museum has been under construction for more than a decade, and an overall opening date has not yet been set, having been repeatedly delayed for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Some sections have been open since 2022 for limited tours. More than 100,000 artifacts of Egypt’s ancient treasures will be displayed in the world’s largest archaeological museum, according to the Egyptian state information website. Abbas told the AP that the trial run starting Wednesday would help prepare for the full opening by identifying operational issues, including which parts of the museum might become overcrowded. The displays across the 12 halls tap into issues related to society, religion, and doctrine in ancient Egypt, he added. The open-style halls have been classified by dynasty and historical order and will showcase thousands of artifacts. Eras that will be exhibited in the main galleries include the Third Intermediate Period (about 1070-664 B.C.), Late Period (664-332 B.C.), Graeco-Roman Period (332 B.C.-395 A.D.), New Kingdom (1550-1070 B.C.), Middle Kingdom (2030-1650 B.C.), and Old Kingdom (2649-2130 B.C.). One of the halls displays statues of 'Elite of the King,' members of the royal family and high-ranking officials who worked in the army, priesthood, and the government. Limited tours have been allowed in parts of the site since late 2022 to test visitors’ experience and the museum’s operational preparedness. Aude Porcedde, a Canadian tourist who visited several sections, told the AP she was amazed by the museum, adding that Egyptian civilization is important for her and for the world to know more about. 'There is a lot of history and a lot of things we are not aware of, especially coming from the other side of the world, and seeing everything here and learning from the locals has been great,' said Costa Rican tourist Jorge Licano. The grand staircase, six stories high and with a view of the pyramids, and the commercial area are open to the public, showcasing monuments and artifacts that include sarcophagi and statues. Other parts of the museum, including the King Tutankhamun treasure collection, are set to open at later dates. All halls are equipped with advanced technology and feature multimedia presentations to explain the lives of the ancient Egyptians, including the kings, according to Eissa Zidan, director-general of preliminary restoration and antiquities transfer at the museum. One of the halls will use virtual reality to explain the history of burial and its development throughout ancient Egypt. 'The museum is not only a place to display antiquities, but it also aims to attract children to learn about ancient Egyptian history ... The museum is a gift to all the world,' Zidan told the AP.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grand-museum-displaying-egypt-s-ancient-treasures-opens-for-trial-run/7824076.html	2024-10-16T01:18:16-07:00	
Spiraling Sudan bloodshed sparks refugee surge into Chad	GENEVA — Nearly three million people have fled Sudan after 18 months of war in a still-growing exodus, the U.N. warned, with 25,000 fleeing to neighboring Chad in the first week of October alone. Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N.'s Sudan regional refugee coordinator, told AFP that the three-million mark will likely be crossed in the next two to three weeks. That the figure is approaching three million is a 'disaster' directly linked to the increasing brutality of the conflict, he said in an interview on Tuesday during a visit to Geneva. War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. Both sides have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians and blocking humanitarian aid. The conflict has left tens of thousands dead and some 26 million people facing severe food insecurity, with famine declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in Sudan's western Darfur region. Some 11.3 million people have been forced to flee, including nearly 2.95 million who have fled across the country's borders, according to the latest figures from UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. Strain on Chad In a sign of the worsening conflict in Darfur, some 25,000 people — 80% of whom were women and children — crossed into eastern Chad in the first week of October, a record number for a single week in 2024. And more than 20,270 crossed into Chad in the whole of September. Chad is host to 681,944 Sudanese refugees — more than any other country. However, it is also one of the poorest countries in the world and is lacking the basic services to accommodate such numbers, said Balde, while highlighting the generosity shown by Chadians towards their fleeing neighbors. 'When we see 25,000 arriving, it's enormous,' he said. He called for greater support from international donors. A UN appeal for $1.51 billion to support Sudanese refugees and their hosts in the region through the end of the year remains just 27% funded. 'It's not enough, because the number of refugees continues to grow,' said Balde, who also serves as the UNHCR's East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes regional director. Balde said he expected 'very unfortunately, in the coming weeks, to have many more refugees in Chad,' due to both the conflict intensifying in Darfur and the drop in water levels as the rainy season ends. Aid still limited With the drier conditions, the UN hopes to be able to deliver more aid to Sudan — if the parties to the conflict allow it. Several rounds of negotiation efforts have so far failed to end the fighting. In late August, following talks outside Geneva convened by the United States, the two factions committed to ensuring safe and unhindered access for humanitarians along two key corridors. 'This has helped us save lives,' but 'not all the commitments made, have been respected' — and the flow of aid remains 'limited,' said Balde, deploring the persistent 'barriers at the administrative level.' In Geneva this week for the UNHCR's annual executive committee meeting, he chaired a discussion on Sudan, during which he asked for support to help Sudanese refugees get into the jobs market and thereby reducing their reliance on humanitarian assistance. 'We are asking development actors to mobilize to complement' such aid, he explained, while stressing the need for peace in Sudan. Balde warned it would be 'a big mistake' to think the flow of displaced people will be limited to Sudan and the wider region. 'There are more and more who are coming towards Italy, Europe and southern Africa,' and 'there are some who will go towards the Gulf countries too,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spiraling-sudan-bloodshed-sparks-refugee-surge-into-chad/7824072.html	2024-10-16T01:04:35-07:00	
Xi says China willing to be a partner, friend with the US	BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle, according to state media on Wednesday. 'China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world,' Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report. Xi pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter. The two countries have been at odds over national security concerns, ongoing trade spats as well as China's actions in the South China Sea and intensified military drills around Taiwan. Trade relations soured over the past year and have centered around issues including restrictions on electric vehicles and advanced semiconductors. 'China has always handled China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other,' Xi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-says-china-willing-to-be-a-partner-friend-with-the-us/7824068.html	2024-10-16T00:54:04-07:00	
Former Malaysian PM Mahathir, 99, hospitalized with respiratory infection	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been admitted to hospital for a respiratory infection, his office said on Wednesday after media reported the ex-premier missed a court hearing in a defamation case he has lodged. The 99-year-old Mahathir, who served as prime minister for more two decades, has a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgeries. He has been in and out of hospital in recent years, and was last hospitalised in July. Mahathir had been due in court on Wednesday for a defamation case he had filed against the current deputy prime minister, but local media reported the hearing was postponed after his lawyer said he had been admitted to the National Heart Institute. An aide of Mahathir told Reuters he was hospitalized on Tuesday evening for coughing due to a lower respiratory tract infection, and would be on medical leave until Oct. 25. Mahathir served as prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He returned as premier in 2018 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win, but his government collapsed in less than two years due to infighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-malaysian-pm-mahathir-99-hospitalized-with-respiratory-infection/7824039.html	2024-10-15T23:31:56-07:00	
Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs	Israeli forces carried out airstrikes Wednesday on Beirut’s southern suburbs, sending plumes of smoke rising from at least two neighborhoods. The Israel Defense Forces said its fighter jets struck a Hezbollah underground weapons warehouse. The attacks followed Israel’s latest evacuation order that warned people to leave areas in Beirut that the Israeli military said were near Hezbollah facilities. Israel also reported more than 50 projectiles were fired from Lebanon Wednesday, while Hezbollah said it launched missiles at an area in northern Israel. The latest Israeli strikes in the area of Lebanon’s capital came a day after the United States said it expressed concerns about such attacks to Israeli officials. 'When it comes to the scope and nature of the bombing campaign that we saw in Beirut over the past few weeks, it's something that we made clear to the government of Israel we had concerns with and we were opposed to,' State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters. Meanwhile, the United States is demanding that Israel boost its humanitarian aid to famished Palestinians in Gaza within the next month or face the possibility that the United States would cut its military aid supporting Israel's year-long war against Hamas militants. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told top Israeli officials in a letter Sunday that Washington has 'deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.' Miller said the message was meant to be a private diplomatic communication but confirmed its veracity. For months, even as Israel's fight against Hamas has raged on, the U.S. has repeatedly pressed Israel to ramp up its humanitarian assistance — food, water, medical supplies, fuel and other goods — to Palestinian civilians. But the humanitarian effort has waxed and waned, the effort hampered by the theft of goods by the militants, continued fighting near drop-off sites and disputes over entry points into Gaza. While some left-wing U.S. lawmakers have urged the administration of President Joe Biden to cut off military aid to Israel to pressure it to reach a cease-fire deal to halt fighting, the United States has continued to supply it, most recently on Sunday when Biden said he ordered the Pentagon to send Israel an advanced missile defense system and deploy about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. The new U.S. effort to boost humanitarian aid into Gaza comes as Israel has both ramped up attacks on Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and renewed its assaults on Hamas in northern Gaza. Both Hezbollah and Hamas, designated as terror groups by the U.S., are financially and militarily supported by Iran. At the same time, Israel has ordered about 400,000 Palestinians remaining in the northern third of Gaza to leave the region and move south out of harm's way. But humanitarian aid remains a distinct concern. The U.S. told the U.N. Security Council last week that Israel needs to urgently address 'catastrophic conditions' among Palestinian civilians in the besieged Gaza Strip and stop 'intensifying suffering' by limiting aid deliveries. Blinken and Austin, in the letter to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, listed specific steps Israel must take within 30 days to satisfy the U.S., including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks to enter Gaza each day through four crossings into Gaza and open a fifth entry point, instituting pauses in fighting to allow aid delivery and rescinding evacuation orders to Palestinian civilians when there is no operational need. 'Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for U.S. policy ... and relevant U.S. law,' the letter said. The Blinken-Austin letter cited the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibits military aid to countries that impede delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance. It also cited Biden's National Security Memorandum issued in February that requires the State Department to report to Congress on whether it finds Israel's assurances credible that its use of U.S. weapons does not violate U.S. or international law. U.S. officials earlier this year said Israel may have violated international humanitarian law using U.S.-supplied weapons during its military operation in Gaza. Over several months, the amount of humanitarian aid being dispatched into Gaza has dropped more than 50%, and the quantity delivered in September 'was the lowest of any month during the past year,' Blinken and Austin said. The Hamas attack on Israel a year ago killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,300 Palestinians, with more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., U.K, EU and others.

EU AI Act checker reveals Big Tech's compliance pitfalls	LONDON — Some of the most prominent artificial intelligence models are falling short of European regulations in key areas such as cybersecurity resilience and discriminatory output, according to data seen by Reuters. The EU had long debated new AI regulations before OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in late 2022. The record-breaking popularity and ensuing public debate over the supposed existential risks of such models spurred lawmakers to draw up specific rules around 'general-purpose' AIs. Now a new tool designed by Swiss startup LatticeFlow and partners, and supported by European Union officials, has tested generative AI models developed by big tech companies like Meta and OpenAI across dozens of categories in line with the bloc's wide-sweeping AI Act, which is coming into effect in stages over the next two years. Awarding each model a score between 0 and 1, a leaderboard published by LatticeFlow on Wednesday showed models developed by Alibaba, Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Mistral all received average scores of 0.75 or above. However, the company's 'Large Language Model (LLM) Checker' uncovered some models' shortcomings in key areas, spotlighting where companies may need to divert resources in order to ensure compliance. Companies failing to comply with the AI Act will face fines of $38 million or 7% of global annual turnover. Mixed results At present, the EU is still trying to establish how the AI Act's rules around generative AI tools like ChatGPT will be enforced, convening experts to craft a code of practice governing the technology by spring 2025. But LatticeFlow's test, developed in collaboration with researchers at Swiss university ETH Zurich and Bulgarian research institute INSAIT, offers an early indicator of specific areas where tech companies risk falling short of the law. For example, discriminatory output has been a persistent issue in the development of generative AI models, reflecting human biases around gender, race and other areas when prompted. When testing for discriminatory output, LatticeFlow's LLM Checker gave OpenAI's 'GPT-3.5 Turbo' a relatively low score of 0.46. For the same category, Alibaba Cloud's 9988.HK 'Qwen1.5 72B Chat' model received only a 0.37. Testing for 'prompt hijacking,' a type of cyberattack in which hackers disguise a malicious prompt as legitimate to extract sensitive information, the LLM Checker awarded Meta's 'Llama 2 13B Chat' model a score of 0.42. In the same category, French startup Mistral's '8x7B Instruct' model received 0.38. 'Claude 3 Opus,' a model developed by Google-backed Anthropic, received the highest average score, 0.89. The test was designed in line with the text of the AI Act, and will be extended to encompass further enforcement measures as they are introduced. LatticeFlow said the LLM Checker would be freely available for developers to test their models' compliance online. Petar Tsankov, the firm's CEO and cofounder, told Reuters the test results were positive overall and offered companies a roadmap for them to fine-tune their models in line with the AI Act. 'The EU is still working out all the compliance benchmarks, but we can already see some gaps in the models,' he said. 'With a greater focus on optimizing for compliance, we believe model providers can be well-prepared to meet regulatory requirements.' Meta declined to comment. Alibaba, Anthropic, Mistral, and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While the European Commission cannot verify external tools, the body has been informed throughout the LLM Checker's development and described it as a 'first step' in putting the new laws into action. A spokesperson for the European Commission said: 'The Commission welcomes this study and AI model evaluation platform as a first step in translating the EU AI Act into technical requirements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-ai-act-checker-reveals-big-tech-s-compliance-pitfalls/7824029.html	2024-10-15T22:58:41-07:00	
Ukraine destroys 51 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it shot down 51 drones that Russia used to target the country in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Serhii Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said air raid alerts lasted for two hours in the Ukrainian capital, but that air defenses destroyed all of the drones that targeted the area. There were no reports of damage or casualties, Popko said on Telegram. Russia also fired two missiles as part of its attack. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported Wednesday that its air defenses destroyed two Ukrainian aerial drones over the Belgorod region and another drone over Voronezh.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-destroys-51-russian-drones/7824025.html	2024-10-15T22:38:14-07:00	
Age of electricity' to follow looming fossil fuel peak, IEA says	LONDON — The world is on the brink of a new age of electricity with fossil fuel demand set to peak by the end of the decade, meaning surplus oil and gas supplies could drive investment into green energy, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. But it also flagged a high level of uncertainty as conflicts embroil the oil and gas-producing Middle East and Russia and as countries representing half of global energy demand have elections in 2024. 'In the second half of this decade, the prospect of more ample – or even surplus – supplies of oil and natural gas, depending on how geopolitical tensions evolve, would move us into a very different energy world,' IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release alongside its annual report. Surplus fossil fuel supplies would likely lead to lower prices and could enable countries to dedicate more resources to clean energy, moving the world into an 'age of electricity,' Birol said. In the nearer term, there is also the possibility of reduced supplies should the Middle East conflict disrupt oil flows. The IEA said such conflicts highlighted the strain on the energy system and the need for investment to speed up the transition to 'cleaner and more secure technologies.' A record-high level of clean energy came online globally last year, the IEA said, including more than 560 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity. Around $2 trillion is expected to be invested in clean energy in 2024, almost double the amount invested in fossil fuels. In its scenario based on current government policies, global oil demand peaks before 2030 at just less than 102 million barrels/day (mb/d), and then falls back to 2023 levels of 99 mb/d by 2035, largely because of lower demand from the transport sector as electric vehicle use increases. The report also lays out the likely impact on future oil prices if stricter environmental policies are implemented globally to combat climate change. In the IEA’s current policies scenario, oil prices decline to $75 per barrel in 2050 from $82 per barrel in 2023. That compares to $25 per barrel in 2050 should government actions fall in line with the goal of cutting energy sector emissions to net zero by then. Although the report forecasts an increase in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 145 billion cubic meters (bcm) between 2023 and 2030, it said this would be outpaced by an increase in export capacity of around 270 bcm over the same period. 'The overhang in LNG capacity looks set to create a very competitive market at least until this is worked off, with prices in key importing regions averaging $6.5-8 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to 2035,' the report said. Asian LNG prices, regarded as an international benchmark are currently around $13 mmBtu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/age-of-electricity-to-follow-looming-fossil-fuel-peak-iea-says/7824017.html	2024-10-15T21:57:39-07:00	
China says it will not renounce use of force over Taiwan	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China will not promise to renounce the use of force over Taiwan but this is aimed at external interference and a small minority of separatists, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Wednesday following the country's latest war games around the island. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, staged a day of large-scale drills around the island on Monday it said were a warning to 'separatist acts' following last week's national day speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. 'We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and endeavor,' Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular press briefing in Beijing. 'But we will never commit ourselves to renouncing the use of force,' he said. That is, however, aimed at the interference of 'external forces' - a reference to the United States and its allies - and the very small number of Taiwan separatists not the vast majority of Taiwan's people, Chen said. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. Speaking to reporters in Taipei earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Ming-yen said China's drills had backfired given the international condemnation they generated, especially from Washington. 'The Chinese communists' military exercise has created a negative effect in that it made the international community more supportive of Taiwan,' he said. Lai, in his Oct. 10 speech, said China has no right to represent Taiwan, but the island was willing to work with Beijing to combat challenges like climate change, striking both a firm and a conciliatory tone which Taiwan officials said was a show of goodwill towards Beijing. Chen, the Chinese spokesperson, said Lai had stuck to his 'stubborn separatist position.' 'There was no goodwill to speak of,' he added. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed. China's military on Monday held open the possibility of more drills around Taiwan depending on the level of 'provocation.' Tsai said the government remained on alert for further military actions. 'We cannot rule out any possibilities,' he added. China has over the past five years sent warships and warplanes in the waters and skies around Taiwan on an almost daily basis. On Wednesday morning, in its daily update of Chinese activities in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had detected 22 Chinese military aircraft and five navy ships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-will-not-renounce-use-of-force-over-taiwan/7824008.html	2024-10-15T21:15:23-07:00	
Georgia judge blocks ballot counting rule and says county officials must certify election results	ATLANTA — A judge has blocked a new rule that requires Georgia Election Day ballots to be counted by hand after the close of voting. The ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law. The State Election Board last month passed the rule requiring that three poll workers each count the paper ballots — not votes — by hand after the polls close. The county election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta’s suburbs, had filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five others recently passed by the state board invalid, saying they exceed the state board’s authority, weren’t adopted in compliance with the law and are unreasonable. In a ruling late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote, that the so-called hand count rule 'is too much, too late' and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the case. McBurney on Monday had ruled in a separate case that 'no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.' While they are entitled to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, 'any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.' Georgia law says county election superintendents — generally multimember boards — 'shall' certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election, or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year. The two rulings came as early in-person voting began Tuesday in Georgia. They are victories for Democrats, liberal voting rights groups and some legal experts who have raised concerns that Donald Trump’s allies could refuse to certify the results if the former president loses to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in next month’s presidential election. They have also argued that new rules enacted by the Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board could be used to stop or delay certification and to undermine public confidence in the results. In blocking the hand count rule, McBurney noted that there are no guidelines or training tools for its implementation and that the secretary of state had said the rule was passed too late for his office to provide meaningful training or support. The judge also wrote that no allowances have been made in county election budgets to provide for additional personnel or expenses associated with the rule. 'The administrative chaos that will — not may — ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair legal, and orderly,' he wrote. The state board may be right that the rule is smart policy, McBurney wrote, but the timing of its passage makes implementing it now 'quite wrong.' He invoked the memory of the riot at the U.S. Capitol by people seeking to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6, 2021, writing, 'Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.' During a hearing earlier Tuesday, Robert Thomas, a lawyer for the State Election Board, argued that the process isn’t complicated and that estimates show that it would take extra minutes, not hours, to complete. He also said memory cards from the scanners, which are used to tally the votes, could be sent to the tabulation center while the hand count is happening so reporting of results wouldn’t be delayed. State and national Democratic groups that had joined the suit on the side of the Cobb election board, along with the Harris campaign, celebrated McBurney's ruling in a joint statement: 'From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it.' The certification ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Julie Adams, a Republican member of the election board in Fulton County, which includes most of the city of Atlanta and is a Democratic stronghold. Adams sought a declaration that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to 'full access' to 'election materials.' Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results. Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argued county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued county election officials could certify results without including certain ballots if they suspect problems. Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, state law says a county election official's 'concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.' The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia had joined the lawsuit as defendants with the support of Harris' campaign. The campaign called the ruling a 'major legal win.' Adams said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election officials 'cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties.' A flurry of election rules passed by the State Election Board since August has generated a crush of lawsuits. McBurney earlier this month heard a challenge to two rules having to do with certification brought by the state and national Democratic parties. Another Fulton County judge is set to hear arguments in two challenges to rules tomorrow — one brought by the Democratic groups and another filed by a group headed by a former Republican lawmaker. And separate challenges are also pending in at least two other counties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-counting-rule-and-says-county-officials-must-certify-election-results/7824005.html	2024-10-15T21:07:05-07:00	
North Korea says 1.4 million young people apply to join army	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean state media said on Wednesday around 1.4 million young people had applied to join or return to the army this week, accusing Seoul of a provocative drone incursion that had brought the 'tense situation to the brink of war.' The young people, including students and youth league officials who had signed petitions to join the army, were determined to fight in a 'sacred war of destroying the enemy with the arms of the revolution,' the KCNA report said. Photographs published by KCNA showed what it said were young people signing petitions at an undisclosed location. North Korea's claim of having more than one million young people volunteering to enlist in the country's Korean People's Army in just two days comes at a time when tensions on the Korean peninsula are running high. North Korea has made similar claims in the past when there have been heightened tensions in the region. Last year, state media reported on 800,000 of its citizens volunteering to join the North's military to fight against the United States. In 2017, nearly 3.5 million workers, party members and soldiers volunteered to join or rejoin its army, the reclusive state's state media said at that time. It is very difficult to verify the North's claims. According to data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), North Korea has 1.28 million active soldiers and about 600,000 reservists. The IISS also said it had 5.7 million Worker/Peasant Red Guard reservists with many units unarmed. In the latest sign of the growing tensions, North Korea blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas on Tuesday, prompting South Korea's military to fire warning shots. Pyongyang had said last week it would cut off the inter-Korean roads and railways entirely and further fortify the areas on its side of the border as part of its push for a 'two-state' system, scrapping its longstanding goal of unification. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. North Korea has also accused Seoul of sending drones over its capital and the two Koreas have clashed over balloons of trash floated since May from North Korea. Pyongyang has said the launches are a response to balloons sent by anti-regime activists in the South. South Korea's government has declined to say whether its military or civilians had flown the alleged drones over Pyongyang. 'If a war breaks out, the ROK will be wiped off the map. As it wants a war, we are willing to put an end to its existence,' the KCNA report said, referring to the South's official name the Republic of Korea. South Korea's defense ministry warned on Sunday 'if North Korea inflicts harm on the safety of our people, that day will be the end of the North Korean regime,' Yonhap news agency reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-1-4-million-young-people-apply-to-join-army/7824002.html	2024-10-15T20:56:50-07:00	
Troops kicked out under 'don't ask, don't tell' upgraded to honorable discharges	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday that more than 800 military personnel have seen their service records upgraded to honorable discharges after previously being kicked out of the military under its former 'don't ask, don't tell' policy. It is the latest development over the decades to undo past discrimination against LGBTQ service members. The 1951 Uniform Code of Military Justice's Article 125 had criminalized consensual gay sex. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton modified the military's policy to 'don't ask, don't tell,' which allowed LGBTQ troops to serve in the armed forces if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. That policy was repealed in 2011, when Congress allowed for their open service in the military. The 1951 UCMJ code was modified in 2013 to be limited to nonconsensual gay sex. President Joe Biden in June announced he was issuing pardons to service members convicted under repealed military policies. Under 'don't ask, don't tell,' thousands of service members still saw their military service ended without an honorable discharge, meaning they did not receive the military benefits they would have otherwise, such as education benefits, and it also could have affected their ability to apply for jobs or loans. Last year, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a review of cases of former service members who might have been affected by the policy. The Pentagon estimates about 13,500 service members were released from military service under 'don't ask, don't tell.' With the review and upgrades of the more than 800 troops announced Tuesday, the Pentagon said that about 96% of the 13,500 personnel affected by the policy had received an honorable discharge. Not every case of the 13,500 needed review. Some of those personnel did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits, were released with an honorable discharge at the time, already had their discharges upgraded through other means, or did not qualify for an upgrade due to other violations. 'We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country,' Austin said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/troops-kicked-out-under-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-upgraded-to-honorable-discharges/7823990.html	2024-10-15T19:43:32-07:00	
Voting rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages	madison, wisconsin — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in a state where they are ineligible. Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that 'thousands of young voters across Wisconsin' received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin. The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison. 'Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible,' the text said. Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes. At least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X. The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action 'the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting.' Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either at their home address or their one at school. 'But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party,' the letter said. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess 'what, if any, follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law.' University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can't determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn't received a formal complaint about it. However, he called the message 'concerning' and said it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message. 'We understand that these third-party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,' Vetterkind said. 'We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.' The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide. Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Wisconsin is one of the 'blue wall' states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-rights-groups-seek-investigation-into-wisconsin-text-messages-/7823623.html	2024-10-15T19:10:42-07:00	
Tech firms increasingly look to nuclear power for data center	As energy-hungry computer data centers and artificial intelligence programs place ever greater demands on the U.S. power grid, tech companies are looking to a technology that just a few years ago appeared ready to be phased out: nuclear energy. After several decades in which investment in new nuclear facilities in the U.S. had slowed to a crawl, tech giants Microsoft and Google have recently announced investments in the technology, aimed at securing a reliable source of emissions-free power for years into the future. Earlier this year, online retailer Amazon, which has an expansive cloud computing business, announced it had reached an agreement to purchase a nuclear energy-fueled data center in Pennsylvania and that it had plans to buy more in the future. However, the three companies' strategies rely on somewhat different approaches to the problem of harnessing nuclear energy, and it remains unclear which, if any, will be successful. Energy demand Data centers, which concentrate thousands of powerful computers in one location, consume prodigious amounts of power, both to run the computers themselves and to operate the elaborate systems put in place to dissipate the large amount of heat they generate. A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers currently consume between 1% and 2% of all available power generation. That percentage is expected to at least double by the end of the decade, even accounting for new power sources coming online. The study projected a 160% increase in data center power consumption by 2030. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that the largest data centers can consume more than 100 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 80,000 homes. Small, modular reactors Google's plan is, in some ways, the most radical departure — both from the current structure of the energy grid and from traditional means of generating nuclear power. The internet search giant announced on Monday that it has partnered with Kairos Power to fund the construction of up to seven small-scale nuclear reactors that, across several locations, would combine to generate 500 megawatts of power. The small modular reactors (SMRs) are a new, and largely untested, technology. Unlike sprawling nuclear plants, SMRs are compact, requiring much less infrastructure to keep them operational and safe. 'The smaller size and modular design can reduce construction timelines, allow deployment in more places, and make the final project delivery more predictable,' Google and Kairos said in a press release. The companies said they intend to have the first of the SMRs online by 2030, with the rest to follow by 2035. Great promise Sola Talabi, president of Pittsburgh Technical, a nuclear consulting firm, told VOA that SMR technology holds great promise for the future. He said that the plants' small size will eliminate many of the safety concerns that larger reactors present. For example, some smaller reactors generate so much less heat than larger reactors that they can utilize 'passive' cooling systems that are not susceptible to the kind of mechanical failures that caused disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant in 2011 and the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant in 1986. Talabi, who is also an adjunct faculty member in nuclear engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and University of Michigan, said that SMRs' modular nature will allow for rapid deployment and substantial cost savings as time goes on. 'Pretty much every reactor that has been built [so far] has been built like it's the first one,' he said. 'But with these reactors, because we will be able to use the same processes, the same facilities, to produce them, we actually expect that we will be able to … achieve deployment scale relatively quickly.' Raising doubts Not all experts are convinced that SMRs are going to live up to expectations. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told VOA that the Kairos reactors Google is hoping to install use a new technology that has never been tested under real-world conditions. 'At this point, it's just hope without any real basis in experimental fact to believe that this is going to be a productive and reliable solution for the need to power data centers over the medium term,' he said. He pointed out that the large-scale deployment of new nuclear reactors will also result in the creation of a new source of nuclear waste, which the U.S. is still struggling to find a way to dispose of at scale. 'I think what we're seeing is really a bubble — a nuclear bubble — which I suspect is going to be deflated once these optimistic, hopeful agreements turn out to be much harder to execute,' Lyman said. Three Mile Island Microsoft and Amazon have plotted a more conventional path toward powering their data centers with nuclear energy. In its announcement last month, Microsoft revealed that it has reached an agreement with Constellation Energy to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and to use the power it produces for its data operations. Three Mile Island is best known as the site of the worst nuclear disaster in U.S. history. In 1979, the site's Unit 2 reactor suffered a malfunction that resulted in radioactive gases and iodine being released into the local environment. However, the facility's Unit 1 reactor did not fail, and it operated safely for several decades. It was shut down in 2019, after cheap shale gas drove the price of energy down so far that it made further operations economically unfeasible. It is expected to cost $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online, and Microsoft has agreed to fund that investment. It has also signed an agreement to purchase power from the facility for 20 years. The companies say they believe that they can bring the facility back online by 2028. Amazon's plan, by contrast, does not require either new technology or the resurrection of an older nuclear facility. The data center that the company purchased from Talen Energy is located on the same site as the fully operational Susquehanna nuclear plant in Salem, Pennsylvania, and draws power directly from it. Amazon characterized the $650 million investment as part of a larger effort to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-firms-increasingly-look-to-nuclear-power-for-data-center/7823925.html	2024-10-15T19:08:59-07:00

Tech firms increasingly look to nuclear power for data center	As energy-hungry computer data centers and artificial intelligence programs place ever greater demands on the U.S. power grid, tech companies are looking to a technology that just a few years ago appeared ready to be phased out: nuclear energy. After several decades in which investment in new nuclear facilities in the U.S. had slowed to a crawl, tech giants Microsoft and Google have recently announced investments in the technology, aimed at securing a reliable source of emissions-free power for years into the future. Earlier this year, online retailer Amazon, which has an expansive cloud computing business, announced it had reached an agreement to purchase a nuclear energy-fueled data center in Pennsylvania and that it had plans to buy more in the future. However, the three companies' strategies rely on somewhat different approaches to the problem of harnessing nuclear energy, and it remains unclear which, if any, will be successful. Energy demand Data centers, which concentrate thousands of powerful computers in one location, consume prodigious amounts of power, both to run the computers themselves and to operate the elaborate systems put in place to dissipate the large amount of heat they generate. A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers currently consume between 1% and 2% of all available power generation. That percentage is expected to at least double by the end of the decade, even accounting for new power sources coming online. The study projected a 160% increase in data center power consumption by 2030. The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that the largest data centers can consume more than 100 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 80,000 homes.

South Korea steps up commitment to South China Sea, with limits	washington — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's tour of Southeast Asian countries shows Seoul has stepped up the country's role in supporting regional security, but there are limits to what it can do to help them push back against China's growing aggression, analysts say. Yoon made several pledges to support regional security during visits to the Philippines, Singapore and Laos, where he attended the closing ceremony of the ASEAN summit on Thursday. He promised South Korea's help in modernizing the Philippine military, agreed to South Korea's active participation in multilateral drills with ASEAN countries, and upgraded ties with ASEAN to a comprehensive strategic partnership. Yoon also affirmed the importance of maritime security and promoting freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. The pledges are seen by analysts as part of Yoon's plan to make South Korea a pivotal global state by demonstrating a greater commitment to the defense of a rules-based world order. Pivotal state A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson told VOA Korean on Tuesday that steps taken by Yoon during the trip reflect the country's 'willingness to strengthen cooperation with ASEAN countries across the board,' including 'bolstering cooperation on the defense sector.' The spokesperson added that South Korea will continue to help maintain maritime security based on the rules-based order in the South China Sea as it builds trust and enhances strategic communications with China. China claims most of the South China Sea as its sovereign maritime territory, and its vessels have repeatedly engaged dangerous maneuvers against the vessels of countries — such as the Philippines — that dispute that claim. South Korea 'can play a niche role in contributing towards the defense capabilities of regional countries to protect their maritime domain against China's intrusions,' said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow in the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute. 'South Korean weapons systems are cheaper than those of the U.S. and are being used by some NATO countries,' Yaacob said. 'Therefore, Seoul could be an important arms supplier to regional countries' as an alternative to U.S. weapons.' In a joint press conference with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. after their meeting on October 7, Yoon said Seoul will support Manila's military modernization plan. The Philippines is seeking to procure advanced fighter jets, submarines and missiles in its third phase of a five-year modernization plan that began in 2023. South Korea has sold FA-50 fighter jets, anti-ship cruise missiles, frigates and corvettes to the Philippines in the past decade. South Korea is also expected to deliver FA-50 fighter jets to Malaysia in 2026 after a deal was signed last year. Facing hurdles While these efforts are noteworthy, analysts say they are not enough to push back against China's growing military might. South Korea 'is unlikely to play an operationally or strategically meaningful role on the South China Sea beyond the occasional coordinated joint maritime cooperative activities,' said Evan Laksmana, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. South Korea has participated in multilateral military drills with Southeast Asian countries, such as the annual U.S.-led Cobra Gold held in Thailand in March and the Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training exercises held in Singapore and other participating countries in August. In delivering the 47th Singapore Lecture on October 9, Yoon said South Korea will actively participate in multilateral drills with ASEAN countries as it expands engagement with China to seek common interests based on a rules-based international order. 'Yoon has been more willing to increase South Korea's support for regional security' than his predecessor Moon Jae-in, 'but he has also recognized the need for restraint in calling out China directly,' said Terence Roehrig, professor of national security affairs and a Korea expert at the U.S. Naval War College. 'South Korea can help along the margins,' but 'offsetting China's strength is near impossible' in the region, Roehrig said. VOA contacted the Chinese Embassy in Washington for its comments on South Korea's efforts to increase security cooperation with ASEAN countries and was referred to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which has not yet replied. China and Russia on Friday blocked a joint declaration issued at the East Asian Summit in Laos, according to Reuters, citing an unnamed U.S. official. The participating countries comprised the 10 ASEAN countries and eight partners, including China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States. Beijing and Moscow objected to a clause that says the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 'sets out the legal framework' for carrying out all maritime activities. A U.N. tribunal ruled in 2016 that China was in violation by operating within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, a maritime area that extends 200 nautical miles beyond a nation's territorial sea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-steps-up-commitment-to-south-china-sea-with-limits-/7823614.html	2024-10-15T17:17:08-07:00	
British foreign secretary expected to visit Beijing, Shanghai	LONDON — British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is expected to visit Beijing and Shanghai, the highest-level trip to China since the Labour government came to power. Analysts say they will be watching the trip for signs of a possible reset in U.K.-China relations, which have been fraught in recent years. Reuters reported last week that Lammy is expected to meet with Chinese officials in Beijing and representatives of British companies in Shanghai. According to sources familiar with the matter, the trip will last two days. The U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson told VOA that the secretary's travel plans have not been publicly announced. At the same time, sources told Sky News that U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is considering a visit to China to resume an economic and financial dialogue that was interrupted in 2019. During this year's parliamentary election campaign, the Labour Party promised to conduct a comprehensive audit of U.K.-China relations to develop a 'long-term strategic approach' to the relationship. In August, during a phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that despite the differences, there was a need to have frank exchanges while promoting closer economic ties and global cooperation. Over the past decade, ties between the U.K. and China have been on a roller coaster. In 2015, then-Prime Minister David Cameron declared a 'golden age' in U.K.-China relations. However, by 2020, Boris Johnson's government was clashing with Beijing over issues such as the Hong Kong National Security Law and the coronavirus pandemic as well as the exclusion of Huawei from Britain's 5G network construction. James Jennion, an associate fellow of the British Foreign Policy Group and co-founder of the Labour Campaign for Human Rights, told VOA that he thinks the visit will focus mainly on cooperative aspects of the relationship. 'It's been made clear this visit is intended as a 'reset' of our relations with Beijing, so trade and investment will be front and center,' Jennion said. He also said cooperation cannot come at the cost of U.K. values and human rights responsibilities. 'Human rights issues, if discussed, will likely cover 'third-party' issues like the Middle East and Ukraine, where possible joint solutions will be discussed. Given the nature and purpose of the trip,' he added. 'I would be very surprised if controversial [to China] issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Taiwan are mentioned, as these have been the major friction points in previous years.' Observers say the business community generally wants to improve economic and trade relations with China, especially in the post-Brexit era, and note that Britain needs to open new markets. Human rights groups, however, have called for the U.K. not to compromise on human rights and national security. Megan Khoo, a policy adviser for Hong Kong Watch, a human rights NGO based in London, told VOA the group 'hopes that the Foreign Secretary uses his bilateral meetings to draw attention to the declining human rights situation in Hong Kong. This is especially important following the passage of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and the recent sentencing of two former Stand News editors under colonial-era sedition laws.' Khoo said Lammy should make it clear that Britain remains committed to the observance of human rights in Hong Kong, given its historical commitments to the city. 'The Foreign Secretary should also signal that the U.K. takes seriously its duty to protect the more than 150,000 Hong Kongers who are now living in the U.K. and wish to remain free from political repression,' she said. Luke De Pulford, executive director for the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said Beijing will test Lammy's resolve. 'Let's see if he measures up and sticks with his clear commitments he made to persecuted Uyghurs while in opposition,' De Pulford said, adding that he is not encouraged by the early signs. 'Lammy has an opportunity to show strength in defense of U.K. values, which are core to the national interest,' he said. China's recent military exercises around Taiwan could also be a topic of discussion. As an ally of the U.S., the U.K. has been concerned about the security situation in the Indo-Pacific region.

Voting rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages	madison, wisconsin — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in a state where they are ineligible. Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that 'thousands of young voters across Wisconsin' received the text message last week, including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at the University of Wisconsin. The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison. 'Don't vote in a state where you're not eligible,' the text said. Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes. At least one person who received the text posted it on the social media platform X. The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said that without prompt action 'the sender may continue its efforts to frighten eligible young voters into not voting.' Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either at their home address or their one at school. 'But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous party,' the letter said. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the request for an investigation and would assess 'what, if any, follow-up is appropriate based on the facts and the law.' University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can't determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn't received a formal complaint about it. However, he called the message 'concerning' and said it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message. 'We understand that these third-party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,' Vetterkind said. 'We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.' The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide. Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Wisconsin is one of the 'blue wall' states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7823623.html	2024-10-15T16:27:13-07:00	
Libya threatens legal action after Nigeria pulls out of football qualifier	Abuja, Nigeria — The Libyan Football Federation (LFF) is criticizing Nigeria's decision to withdraw from the 2025 AFCON qualifier in Libya and is threatening to take legal action. On Monday, Nigeria's national football team the Super Eagles walked off the fixture citing safety concerns after being stranded at a local airport in Libya without food and internet access for more than 16 hours. Tuesday's statement by the LFF accused its Nigerian counterpart, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) of not cooperating with local organizers. LFF said the flight diversion was possibly caused by routine aircraft protocols, security checks or logistical problems beyond their control, adding that Libyan players faced similar challenges in last week's reverse fixture in Nigeria. LFF said it will 'take all legal measures to preserve the interests of the Libyan national football team.' The Nigerian Super Eagles had been scheduled to take on the Mediterranean Knights of Libya on Tuesday to seal their qualification for the 2025 AFCON finals in Morocco. However, the Nigerian men's team pulled out of its Confederation of African Football, or CAF, qualifier in Libya and returned home in protest at being abandoned at an airport after their plane was diverted. The NFF said the team was taken to Al-Abraq International Airport three hours away from the venue of the match and that local authorities did not make alternative travel plans for the team. 'It is consistent with their … hostile attitude toward other Africans,' said Ademola Olajire, spokesperson of the NFF. 'We have filed a formal letter, the whole world is aware of what happened and how everything went, and we expect a reasonable and justifiable decision from CAF.' Libyan authorities also have rejected allegations of foul play or willful attempt to dampen the morale of the Nigerian players ahead of Tuesday's match. However, Nigerian sports analyst Daniel Aderiye said Libya has faltered many times in the past. 'Historical antecedents have put them in a very bad spot,' Aderiye said. 'It's the most hostile environment anybody can play football in. They should go ahead and threaten because as far as we're concerned, we will not be dimwitted. CAF has said they're going to intervene — a disciplinary board has been set up to that effect.' On Monday, the CAF said it was talking to both Nigeria and Libya and would take action if a member violated its rules. Local football club coach Fred Tebit said Nigeria's diminishing positive public image is to blame. 'We should not forget where we belong in the ranks of Africa — a national team of such caliber with players playing all over the top clubs in Europe will be treated as such, and I think CAF should take a tough stance on this,' he said. 'Our government is not helping matters, our country is full of corruption, embezzlement, so that's why the Libyans [think] they can measure shoulders with us.' Last Friday, Nigeria defeated Libya 1-0, securing seven points over three games in their group. The top two teams in each group will advance to the 24-team finals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/libya-threatens-legal-action-after-nigeria-pulls-out-of-football-qualifier/7823586.html	2024-10-15T15:52:02-07:00	
Chinese spamouflage campaign highlights US support for Israel	washington — U.S. support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has been heavily exploited by China-connected bots, a joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan's social media analytic firm DoubleThink Lab, or DTL, has found. Their postings on social media platform X depict Washington as a peddler of war and a disrupter of global peace. The investigation has tracked and analyzed content amplified in the past 12 months by three distinct spamouflage networks with a total of 140 accounts. Each account has been disguised to look like the work of an authentic user in order to spread pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation. Content within the networks originates with three main 'seeder' accounts and then is amplified by the others. The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation found that more than half of the content, totaling 399 posts in the last year, was about the war in Gaza. Most of those focused on U.S. military support for Israel and on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campuses in America and other Western countries. One such post showed what appeared to be an AI-generated photo of a baby wrapped in a blood-stained white blanket, lying on a table surrounded by a circle of chairs bearing the flags of the U.S., Israel, the U.K., France, Italy and Canada. 'Bloody feast' was written at the bottom of the photo. Some posts accused the U.S. of benefiting financially from the war in Gaza. Other posts slammed Washington for funding the war while refusing to provide its own people with free health care and education. Often, these criticisms were accompanied by conspiracy theories claiming the U.S. government is controlled by the Israeli government and Jewish cabals. One post tried to connect the wars in Gaza and Ukraine to Hurricane Helene, which recently ravaged parts of the Southeastern U.S., and accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, of neglecting domestic needs in order to fund foreign conflicts. 'FEMA, all Jews, refused to give humanitarian aid to American victims after the hurricane,' the post wrongly claimed. 'They gave all YOUR MONEY to 'migrants' and foreign countries. BECAUSE THEY HATE AMERICA!' The unfounded accusation, like the majority of the content amplified by the spamouflage networks, had already been circulating online. The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation found that these posts have reached few real users and have had only a limited impact on X. Two of the three seeder accounts cited in this article have been suspended by X. Echoing Beijing The VOA Mandarin-DTL investigation has not been able to link the spamouflage networks directly to the Chinese government, although disinformation experts and U.S. government officials have warned repeatedly of Beijing meddling in American politics through influence campaigns — something China has repeatedly denied. But the Chinese government has long been promoting the same narratives promoted by the spamouflage networks, which is that the U.S. is responsible for perpetuating the war in Gaza since October of last year. On October 7, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency released an article to mark the first anniversary of the violent conflict, criticizing Washington's military and diplomatic support of Israel. 'The United States' disheartening response to the conflict between Hamas and Israel has significantly tarnished its international standing in the Middle East,' the article asserted. In a post last week on X, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said this in a short post: 'The 'genocide' in Xinjiang? Reflect on your own history & what's happening in Gaza first.' Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA Mandarin that in addition to undermining the global image of the U.S., Beijing sees the conflict in Gaza as an opportunity to invalidate the West's criticism of its own human rights record. 'It portrays the U.S. as hypocritical,' he said. 'They're saying, 'Look, it's America that's helping Israelis commit genocide against the Palestinians and sending their weapons and protecting them at the [U.N.] Security Council.'' China has been accused of the mass detention of Uyghur Muslim minorities in its western Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. A 2022 U.N. report concluded that Beijing's actions in the region 'may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.' The U.S. government has labeled the alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang as genocide. Beijing denies the accusations and repeatedly has said its measures in Xinjiang are aimed at combating terrorism and extremism and ensuring regional security and development.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-spamouflage-campaign-highlights-us-support-for-israel/7823566.html	2024-10-15T15:47:55-07:00	
Report: Iran cyberattacks against Israel surge after Gaza war	Israel has become the top target of Iranian cyberattacks since the start of the Gaza war last year, while Tehran had focused primarily on the United States before the conflict, Microsoft said Tuesday. 'Following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Iran surged its cyber, influence, and cyber-enabled influence operations against Israel,' Microsoft said in an annual report. 'From October 7, 2023, to July 2024, nearly half of the Iranian operations Microsoft observed targeted Israeli companies,' said the Microsoft Digital Defense Report. From July to October 2023, only 10 percent of Iranian cyberattacks targeted Israel, while 35 percent aimed at American entities and 20 percent at the United Arab Emirates, according to the US software giant. Since the war started Iran has launched numerous social media operations with the aim of destabilizing Israel. 'Within two days of Hamas' attack on Israel, Iran stood up several new influence operations,' Microsoft said. An account called 'Tears of War' impersonated Israeli activists critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of a crisis over scores of hostages taken by Hamas, according to the report. An account called 'KarMa', created by an Iranian intelligence unit, claimed to represent Israelis calling for Netanyahu's resignation. Iran also began impersonating partners after the war started, Microsoft said. Iranian services created a Telegram account using the logo of the military wing of Hamas to spread false messages about the hostages in Gaza and threaten Israelis, Microsoft said. It was not clear if Iran acted with Hamas's consent, it added. 'Iranian groups also expanded their cyber-enabled influence operations beyond Israel, with a focus on undermining international political, military, and economic support for Israel's military operations,' the report said. The Hamas terror attack on October 7, 2023, resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures, including hostages killed in captivity. Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed 42,289 people, the majority civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. The U.N. has described the figures as reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-iran-cyberattacks-against-israel-surge-after-gaza-war/7823577.html	2024-10-15T15:06:38-07:00	
Hope, frustration as Bangladesh investigates enforced disappearances	In Bangladesh, an independent commission formed after the August ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is investigating enforced disappearances during her 15-year rule.

FEMA resumes door-to-door visits in North Carolina after threats tied to disinformation	Federal disaster personnel have resumed door-to-door visits as part of their hurricane-recovery work in North Carolina, an effort temporarily suspended amid threats that prompted officials to condemn the spread of disinformation. Over the weekend, reports emerged that workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be targeted by militia as the government responds to Hurricane Helene. A sheriff's office said Monday that one man was arrested during an investigation, but that the suspect acted alone. FEMA made operational changes to keep personnel safe 'out of an abundance of caution,' agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said at a briefing Tuesday. FEMA workers were back in the field Monday, accompanied by Criswell, and she said disaster-assistance teams helping survivors apply for FEMA aid as well as state and local assistance will continue to go door-to-door. She emphasized that the agency isn't going anywhere. 'The federal family has been here working side by side with the state since Day One. These are people who put their lives on hold to help those who have lost everything,' Criswell said. 'So let me be clear: I take these threats seriously.' North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said he directed the state's Department of Public Safety to coordinate law enforcement assistance for FEMA and other responders. He stressed the damage that internet rumors and falsehoods were causing and said officials may never know how many people won't apply for assistance because of bad information. 'There's still a persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation about recovery efforts in western North Carolina that can lead to threats and intimidation, breeds confusion and demoralizes storm survivors and response workers alike,' Cooper said at the briefing. 'If you're participating in spreading this stuff, stop it. Whatever your aim is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North Carolina who need help.' The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office said it received a call Saturday about a man with an assault rifle who made a comment 'about possibly harming' FEMA employees working in the hard-hit areas of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock in the North Carolina mountains. A man was charged with 'going armed to the terror of the public,' a misdemeanor, and was released after posting bond. The sheriff's office said it received initial reports that a 'truckload of militia' was involved in the threat, but further investigation determined the man acted alone. FEMA has faced rampant disinformation about its response to Helene, which hit Florida on September 26 before heading north and leaving a trail of destruction across six states. Asked what might be fueling disinformation, Cooper said social media has become more extreme, but he also pointed to politics. 'This is happening in the middle of an election where candidates are using people's misery to sow chaos for their own political objectives — and it's wrong,' he said. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on the storm's aftermath to spread false information about the Biden administration's response in the final weeks before the election. Their debunked claims include false statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants, that people accepting federal relief money could see their land seized and that FEMA is halting trucks full of supplies. Helene decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia, left millions without power, knocked out cellular service and killed at least 246 people. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. Terrie Daughtry, a volunteer handling therapy dogs Tuesday at a FEMA Disaster Recovery Center in Asheville, said threats and misinformation — including the militia rumors — made her feel unsafe for the first time in several trips to volunteer at disaster sites. 'I'm not coming to risk my life with it all, to be shot or hurt or trampled because of lunacy,' said Daughtry, who volunteers with Therapy Dogs International. She said she previously traveled to help in the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, floods in Virginia and tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. She and another volunteer have been using their therapy dogs to calm people waiting in line to make FEMA claims. They hand out candy, let people pet the dogs and talk to people about their experiences. Despite the extra stress from the 'absolutely ridiculous' threats and misinformation, Daughtry said she's seen some amazing moments of human spirit. At one point on Monday, someone in line started playing a guitar and singing about having no water, she said. Eventually, the whole line sang along. 'These are special people. They're singing in horrible adversity,' she said. 'It made me tear up being there, and it's making me tear up now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fema-resumes-door-to-door-visits-in-north-carolina-after-threats-tied-to-disinformation-/7823567.html	2024-10-15T14:54:57-07:00	
Thousands attend funeral service in Bosnia for 19 killed in floods	JABLANICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina — Several thousand mourners in southern Bosnia converged Tuesday around 19 caskets covered in traditional Islamic green cloth, part of a funeral service held for those killed during the destructive floods and landslides that hit the country in early October. Torrential rains and winds slammed four municipalities in central and southern Bosnia early on Oct. 4, catching people by surprise. Entire areas were cut off as flash floods swept away roads and bridges, and at least 26 people were reported dead. Authorities are still looking for one missing person. The 19 victims were from Donja Jablanica, a village outside the town of Jablanica where the Bosnian Islamic Community Grand Mufti Husein Kavazovic led the service. 'No words are necessary,' Kavazovic said, addressing the mourners as they stood outside Jablanica Mosque. 'Although the grief is deep and unbearable, we are aware that God decides about our lives. We are mortals.' Burials were to be held separately after the service ended. People from Donja Jablanica said they heard a thunderous roar before piles of rocks, mud and water descended on the village. Many houses were demolished and some families lost most of their members. Enes Dzino said his daughter-in-law's nine family members were killed in the floods, except for one child who has been hospitalized. 'It's hard, very hard to bear,' he said. 'They were all gone in a second, her entire family. All killed.' Bosnia's neighbors and European Union countries sent help. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-attend-funeral-service-in-bosnia-for-19-killed-in-floods-/7823542.html	2024-10-15T14:17:07-07:00	
Georgia judge rules county election officials must certify election results	ATLANTA, georgia — A Georgia judge has ruled county election officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law and cannot exclude any group of votes from certification even if they suspect error or fraud. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that 'no election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance.' While they have the right to inspect the conduct of an election and to review related documents, he wrote, 'any delay in receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results or abstaining from doing so.' Georgia law says county election superintendents, which are multimember boards in most counties, 'shall' certify election results by 5 p.m. on the Monday after an election — or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is this year. The ruling comes as early voting began Tuesday in Georgia. Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County election board, had asked the judge to declare that her duties as an election board member were discretionary and that she is entitled to 'full access' to 'election materials.' Long an administrative task that attracted little attention, certification of election results has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused to certify election results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election results. Adams' suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, argues that county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also argued that county election officials could certify results without including ballots that appear to have problems, allaying concerns of a board member who might otherwise vote not to certify. Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, the law says a county election official's 'concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.' Both sides in the fight over certification claimed McBurney's ruling as a victory. The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia, with the support of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, had joined the lawsuit as defendants and called the ruling a 'major legal win.' Adams has said she was not given access to county election documents with enough time to consider them before the certification vote for elections earlier this year. She said in a statement that McBurney's ruling has made it clear that she and other county election board members 'cannot be barred from access to elections in their counties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-judge-rules-county-election-officials-must-certify-election-results-/7823512.html	2024-10-15T13:53:22-07:00	
Beijing calls for urgency as Pakistan boosts security for Chinese projects	KARACHI, PAKISTAN — Pakistan has agreed to increase security for Chinese citizens and projects in the South Asian nation, a joint statement said on Tuesday, as Beijing called for urgent security measures following an escalation in militant threats in the country. China has pumped billions of dollars into Pakistan over the years building infrastructure under the Belt and Road Initiative, while also running a strategic port and a major mine in the country. But its citizens and projects have been attacked continuously by separatist militants fighting against what they call exploitation of the mineral-rich southwestern Balochistan province. 'The Chinese side underscored the need and urgency to take targeted security measures in Pakistan, to jointly create a safe environment for cooperation,' said a joint statement on the visit of Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Li arrived in Islamabad on Monday for a four-day visit — the first visit by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years — days after a suicide bombing in Karachi killed two Chinese engineers. It was the second attack on Chinese engineers in the country this year. The visit coincides with a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a Eurasian security and political group. The Pakistani side emphasized its firm commitment to enhancing security input and coordination as well as strengthening security measures, the statement, released by Pakistan's foreign office, said. Pakistan will make 'comprehensive efforts to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions,' the 30-point statement said. Islamabad is under tight security for the duration of the Chinese premier's visit, which concludes on Thursday. The joint statement also touched on regional, economic and diplomatic cooperation between the two countries. Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to an upgraded version of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a $65 billion investment in the South Asian country under Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-calls-for-urgency-as-pakistan-boosts-security-for-chinese-projects/7823509.html	2024-10-15T13:25:50-07:00	
Georgia’s leaders stoke fears of Russian war ahead of pivotal election	The republic of Georgia – which was part of the Soviet Union until independence in 1991 - is preparing for a crucial election on October 26th, which is widely seen as a choice between a future aligned with the West or Russia. Western powers accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of a backsliding of democracy. As Henry Ridgwell reports from the capital, Tbilisi, the party’s leaders are seeking ahead of the election to capitalize on Georgian voters’ fears of war.

WHO: Gaza polio campaign starts well, despite Israeli strikes	Geneva — The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it had been able to start its polio campaign in central Gaza and vaccinate tens of thousands of children despite Israeli strikes in the designated protected zone hours before. As part of an agreement between the Israeli military and Palestinian militant group Hamas, humanitarian pauses in the year-long Gaza war had been due to begin early on Monday to reach hundreds of thousands of children. However, hours before then, the U.N. humanitarian office said Israeli forces struck tents near al Aqsa hospital, inside in the zone, where it said four people were burned to death. The U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said one of its schools in the central Gazan city of Nuseirat, intended as a vaccination site, was hit overnight between Sunday and Monday, killing up to 22 people. WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva press briefing that over 92,000 children, or around half of the children targeted for polio vaccines in the central area, had been inoculated on Monday. 'What we have received from colleagues is that the vaccination went without a major issue yesterday, and we hope It will continue the same way,' he said. Other humanitarian agencies have previously voiced concerns about the viability of the polio campaign in northern Gaza, where an Israeli offensive is under way. Aid groups carried out an initial round of vaccinations last month, after a baby was partially paralyzed by the type 2 polio virus in August, in the first such case in the territory in 25 years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-gaza-polio-campaign-starts-well-despite-israeli-strikes/7823393.html	2024-10-15T12:14:05-07:00	
Conflict, climate change increase hunger and malnutrition across Africa	geneva — While the world’s farmers produce more than enough food to feed the planet’s nearly 8 billion people, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 'hunger and malnutrition are a fact of life' for billions. In a message in advance of World Food Day on October 16, Guterres said 733 million people globally are short of food because of 'conflict, marginalization, climate change, poverty and economic downturns.' The Food and Agriculture Organization was established 79 years ago on October 16 with a mandate to provide people with greater access to food that not only quelled hunger but also was safe, nutritious and culturally acceptable. But Dominique Burgeon, director of the FAO Liason Office in Geneva, told journalists Tuesday that 'We continue to witness severe imbalances across the world.' 'One in 11 people in the world go to bed hungry every day, over 2.8 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet. … We have also the issue of stunting and wasting. As we speak, about 148 million children under the age of 5 are too short for their age, and 45 million are too thin for their height,' he said. The U.N. children’s fund said children suffering from wasting, which is caused by a lack of nutritious and safe food and repeated bouts of disease, are dangerously thin and their immune systems are weak, 'leaving them vulnerable to growth failure, poor development and death.' UNICEF appealed for $165 million Tuesday to provide essential ready-to-use-therapeutic food for nearly 2 million severely malnourished children 'at risk of death' in the 12 hardest-hit countries — Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Pakistan and Uganda. 'Levels of severe wasting in children under 5 years remain gravely high in several countries, fueled by conflict, economic shocks and climate crises,' it warned. The International Committee of the Red Cross is among several humanitarian agencies expressing alarm at the escalating incidence of acute hunger and malnutrition across wide swathes of Africa. 'The consequences of armed conflict in the region of Lake Chad, compounded by the effect of climate change, continue killing people, and especially the most vulnerable, the young children,' said Yann Bonzon, head of the ICRC delegation for Nigeria. Speaking in Nigeria, he told journalists that 'Every day, doctors and nurses in health facilities we support in northeast Nigeria receive and treat severely malnourished kids. Desperate mothers tell us every day how healthy children become weak and fall sick, and how putting food on the table has turned into a daily struggle.' Underscoring the seriousness of the situation, he noted that the number of children treated for severe malnutrition in ICRC health facilities in northeast Nigeria has increased by 24% over the past year. Humanitarian organizations estimate that across the Lake Chad region nearly 6.1 million people, the highest number in the past four years, will suffer from food shortages in the coming months. 'Farmers tell us how the rampant insecurity due to conflict is preventing farmers from planting their crops' and climate shocks have damaged crops, 'contributing to a food crisis across Lake Chad in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria,' Bonzon said. A similar scenario is playing out in southern Africa. The United Nations warns a widespread drought in the region, triggered by an El Nino weather pattern could turn into a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe without international assistance. The World Food Program said the historic drought has devastated more than 27 million lives across the region, noting that some 21 million children are malnourished. 'For many communities, this is the worst food crisis yet,' said Tomson Phiri, WFP spokesperson for Southern Africa. 'October in Southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April,' he said. ' Crops have failed, livestock has perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day. The situation is dire, and the need for action has never been clearer.' The World Food Program said a record five countries – Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe – have declared the hunger crisis 'a state of disaster' and have called for international support. The agency noted that Angola and Mozambique also are severely affected. The U.N. food agency expressed concern that urgent appeals for international support are falling on deaf ears, noting that 'we have only received one-fifth of the $369 million needed to provide life-saving assistance to millions in southern Africa.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7823323.html	2024-10-15T11:32:21-07:00

DeSantis praises Milton recovery efforts as rising flood waters persist in Florida	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — While there's still more work to do, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday praised Hurricane Milton recovery efforts, saying power has never been restored to so many so quickly after a major storm. 'President (Ronald) Reagan used to say the most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.' There's a lot of wisdom in that, but I don't think The Gipper ever saw Florida respond to a natural disaster, because we get after it and we do make a difference,' DeSantis said at a news conference in front of a flooded road in Zephyrhills. There were still about 170,000 customers without electricity, rivers continued to rise in some flooded areas and the state was still providing free gas to residents struggling to top of their tanks. But DeSantis pointed out that more than 4 million customers had power restored less than a week after the Category 3 storm. At least 11 people died less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene inflicted major damage in Florida and other Southeastern states. The death toll from Helene is more than 240. While most gas stations were back up and running, the state still has 10 active fuel distribution centers providing free gas to residents. DeSantis said more than 2 million gallons had been distributed so far. As happened two years ago during Hurricane Ian, parts of central Florida on Tuesday were flooding almost a week after Milton made landfall due to the rising St. Johns River. In Seminole County, north of Orlando, crews closed roads along the shores of Lake Harney and Lake Jesup after several homes were flooded by the river. Since last Thursday, at least 15 people have been evacuated from homes in nearby Geneva and a neighborhood in Altamonte Springs located in a crook of the Little Wekiva River. Water levels along the St. Johns River were expected to crest later in the week. In Sumter County, home to the sprawling retirement community, The Villages, residents along the Little Withlacoochee River were being encouraged to evacuate as river levels rose. Residents who decided to evacuate were offered shelter at the Sumter County Fairgrounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desantis-praises-milton-recovery-efforts-as-rising-flood-waters-persist-in-florida/7823318.html	2024-10-15T11:15:06-07:00	
Africa’s farming future could include more digital solutions	NAIROBI, KENYA — More than 400 delegates and organizations working in Africa’s farming sector are in Nairobi, Kenya, this week to discuss how digital agriculture can improve the lives of farmers and the continent's food system. Tech innovators discussed the need for increased funding, especially for women. In past decades, African farmers have struggled to produce enough food to feed the continent. DigiCow is one of the tech companies at the conference that says it has answers to the problem. The Kenya-based company says it provides farmers with digital recordkeeping, education via audio on an app, and access to financing and marketing. Maureen Saitoti, DigiCow’s brand manager, said the platform has improved the lives of at least half a million farmers. 'Other than access to finance, it is also able to offer access to the market because a farmer is able to predict the harvest they are anticipating and begin conversations with buyers who have also been on board on the platform,' she said. 'So, this has proven to provide a wholesome integration of the ecosystem, supporting small-scale farmers.' Integrating digital systems into food production helps farmers gain access to seed, fertilizer and loans, and helps prevent pests and diseases on farms, organizers said. Innovation in agriculture technology is seen as helping reach marginalized groups, including women. Sieka Gatabaki, program director for Mercy Corps AgriFin, which is in 40 countries working with digital tool providers to increase the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers, said his organization stresses education and practical information. 'We also focus on agronomic advice that gives the farmers the right kind of skills and knowledge to execute on their farms, as well as precision information such as weather that enables them to make the right decisions [about] how they grow and when they should grow and what they should grow in different geomatic climates,' Gatabaki said. 'Then we definitely expect that those farmers will increase their productivity and income.' According to the State of AgTech Investment Report 2024, farming attracted $1.6 billion in funding in the past decade. But experts say the current funding is not enough to meet the sector's growing demands. David Saunder, director of strategy and growth at Briter Bridges, says funding systems have evolved to cope with problems faced by farmers and the food industry. 'Funding follows those businesses, those startups, that can viably grow and scale their businesses, and that's what we are trying to do with AgTech to increase the data and information on those,' he said. During the meeting, tech developers, experts and donors will also discuss how artificial intelligence and alternative data could be used to improve productivity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-s-farming-future-could-include-more-digital-solutions/7823294.html	2024-10-15T11:14:51-07:00	
Secret Venezuelan court recordings show injustice of trial, journalist says	MADRID — The recordings are not very clear but that is because they were taken clandestinely, in a Venezuelan courtroom. Jesus Medina Ezaine managed to record his appearances in court to try to prove his innocence against charges of inciting hate, money laundering, criminal association and obtaining illegal profits from the public administration. Medina, who denied all charges, faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. A journalist for Dolar Today — an independent daily that is critical of Venezuela’s government — Medina later published extracts from the court hearings on social media to show he had accurately described how the Venezuelan legal system denies basic rights. Medina, who went into exile last month, said he has been persecuted by the government of President Nicolas Maduro for six years. Authorities claim the case was connected to an allegation that the journalist faked his own kidnapping in 2017. But the charges did not mention it, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported. Medina’s story is typical of other journalists who have left Venezuela because of a crackdown by the Maduro government against the media and political activists after disputed presidential elections on July 28. Venezuela has arrested several reporters and canceled the passports of dozens of journalists and activists since the election in what campaigners say is an intensifying campaign of repression. In September, Medina fled Venezuela for Colombia by walking across the border. Three months earlier, a court had cleared Medina of charges including inciting hate. But the government then ordered a retrial. The journalist had already experienced what life is like in prison: He was jailed for nearly three years between 2017 and 2020 in a high-security military jail awaiting trial. With a retrial looming, he decided he had to leave his country, his girlfriend and family behind. Medina said he was a victim of an 'unjust' judicial system, which forced him to appear multiple times in court. Media are rarely allowed into courts to cover trials, even those that are public. But Medina and another journalist who spoke with VOA said that media also fear retaliation from authorities if they cover such cases. 'In Venezuela, all the judicial processes are unjust and more so when they are for political issues. For this reason, I decided to record all the hearings,' Medina told VOA. In one recording, a judge called Medina to give evidence in his defense. He took the stand and said that government officials accused him of inciting hate, which carries a prison sentence of between 10 and 15 years if convicted. 'In court, I said that the owner of a Venezuelan state television station threatened to plant a bomb to shut me up,' he told VOA. 'Later in the audio, my defense lawyer said there was no evidence of me inciting violence or hate. The judge then asked a government official if there was any evidence against me, and when he said no, the judge ordered that I should be cleared.' The judge recorded a verdict of not guilty, but the government appealed. 'I managed to record with hidden microphones the trial which the state of Venezuela carried out against me to publicly demonstrate my innocence, [to show] my triumph against the justice system,' Medina told VOA. He also detailed every step of his 'Kafkaesque' judicial ordeal. He faced one trial and 14 postponed preliminary hearings. Five times proceedings were interrupted, Medina said. In 33 hearings, government officials failed to turn up to give evidence, and they all were interrupted. Medina was ordered by the court to turn up to report at a police station every eight days. He did this 231 times during the entire judicial process. During the judicial process, he was banned from leaving Venezuela, prohibited from obtaining a new passport and opening a new bank account. The court also ordered that Medina’s name be withdrawn from some media, which meant that he could not get work. The Venezuelan government and the embassy in Madrid did not respond to requests from VOA for comment on Medina’s case. Carlos Correa, a lawyer, journalist and director of Espacio Publico, a civil association in Venezuela that defends the freedom of expression, said the government denied Medina legal rights guaranteed under international law. Medina 'was denied the right to a fair trial and denied the right to his liberty at different times. He was denied the right to justice of Venezuela and international human rights,' he told VOA. Watchdogs drew attention to the legal case, including statements from the Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a media watchdog in Venezuela that in 2022 said: 'The interpretation of judicial regulations in favor of the interests of those in power continues to violate the rights of Jesus Medina Ezaine. 'The political bias and arbitrariness of public institutions represent a threat to press freedom in this country,' the statement said. Those threats have increased since the July elections, watchdogs say. Electoral officials and Venezuela’s top court declared Maduro the winner of the election with just under 52% of the vote. But the opposition says voting machine receipts show a landslide victory for their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who fled to exile in Spain. Some Western governments, including the United States, have alleged electoral fraud. Media watchdogs note that journalists are being targeted. 'As protests condemning electoral fraud grip Venezuela, journalists have faced threats, censorship and arrests,' said Reporters Without Borders in a report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/secret-venezuelan-court-recordings-show-injustice-of-trial-journalist-says/7823159.html	2024-10-15T09:44:58-07:00	
US slaps sanctions on 'sham charity' fundraising for Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine	WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on what it said was a key international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which Washington has designated a terrorist organization. The U.S. Treasury Department, in action taken with Canada, said in a statement it imposed sanctions on the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, accusing it of being 'a sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser' for the PFLP. The PFLP, which has also taken part in the fight against Israel in Gaza, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. The Treasury said PFLP uses Samidoun to fundraise in Europe and North America. The group's activities were banned by Germany last year. 'Organizations like Samidoun masquerade as charitable actors that claim to provide humanitarian support to those in need, yet in reality divert funds for much-needed assistance to support terrorist groups,' Treasury's acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. The Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network did not respond immediately to a Reuters request for comment. A member of the PFLP's leadership abroad was also targeted with sanctions on Tuesday. Canada announced the listing of Samidoun as a terrorist entity on Tuesday. 'Violent extremism, acts of terrorism or terrorist financing have no place in Canadian society or abroad,' Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement announcing the listing. The Treasury said the PFLP remained active in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including participating in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, by Israeli tallies. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so far, according to Gaza's health authorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slaps-sanctions-on-sham-charity-fundraising-for-popular-front-for-liberation-of-palestine/7823098.html	2024-10-15T08:55:12-07:00	
As US presidential vote looms, newsrooms focus on how to stay safe	Washington/New York — On a rainy day in September, a group of journalists gathered in a nondescript office building outside Washington. Some were seasoned reporters, others still students. But they were all there to learn how to stay safe while covering elections and unrest. Organized by the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, the training session was part of a national campaign to teach journalists based in the United States how to stay safe on assignment, including while reporting on the presidential campaign. Over the past year, the IWMF has trained more than 620 journalists across 13 states. 'This safety tour has really been illuminating. Unfortunately, what we are hearing is quite alarming, and it’s not just about election reporting,' IWMF executive director Elisa Lees Munoz told VOA. 'What we’re understanding more and more is that literally every beat in America has become a polarizing beat, and therefore has become a dangerous beat.' Three times as many journalists have been arrested in the U.S. this year compared to last year, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. More journalists have been assaulted too, according to the group’s data. 'We’re seeing journalists still struggling every day to uphold that basic right of freedom of the press,' Kirstin McCudden, the Tracker’s managing editor, told VOA at the group’s office in Brooklyn. 'It’s a little alarming.' Many of the incidents took place during pro-Palestine protests. In one case, three photojournalists were arrested in Chicago in August while covering a protest on the outskirts of the Democratic National Convention. 'Police departments feel that they have the power to violate the rights of journalists. Then what ends up happening is it turns into a snowball effect. More police agencies crack down even harder,' said Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which publishes the Tracker. While press freedom is often a local issue, it also matters what presidential candidates are saying and how they treat the press, multiple analysts said. The campaign of former President Donald Trump has been punctuated by the same kinds of attacks against the media that characterized his presidency, the analysts who spoke with VOA said. Leading up to and during Trump’s presidency, Stephanie Sugars, a senior reporter at the Tracker, documented more than 2,000 anti-media posts by Trump on the social media platform X, then known as Twitter. The tenor of those posts evolved from targeting individual journalists to targeting specific news outlets to targeting the media industry writ large. 'A lot of that rhetoric is still in play and is part of his playbook,' Sugars said. She added that the Tracker would monitor anti-media posts from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if those kinds of posts existed. Sugars cautioned against solely blaming Trump for the increased hostility facing journalists in the U.S. But, she said, he hasn’t helped the situation either. 'If you sow distrust in these sorts of external sources and really encourage your followers, those who support you, to only believe what you specifically say, that’s a great way to maintain firm control over what the narrative is, what truth is understood to be, and that’s an incredible amount of power to have,' Sugars said. McCudden agreed. 'Rhetoric does matter, and it’s fuel to the fire,' she said. In response to VOA’s request for comment, Trump’s presidential campaign shared a statement that Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news site the Daily Caller. In it, Rogers described Trump as a 'champion for free speech' and said that 'everyone was safer under President Trump, including journalists.' Mitigating risk The hostile environment for journalists comes at a time when trust in media is already at a record low in the U.S., according to Gallup. Attacks or hostile rhetoric against the press only make the situation worse. So far, the Tracker has documented only a few violations directly related to the election. But, McCudden said, 'History tells us that we should be worried and aware.' She cited the January 6 insurrection on the Capitol, where 18 journalists were assaulted. It may take a few days for the election results to be confirmed, McCudden said. 'And in that time, tensions will be high. And journalists whose job it is to cover these tense times are also often in harm’s way,' she said. The IWMF’s safety training originally was directed at journalists in combat zones and dangerous regions. But following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when attacks on the media began to rise, the IWMF realized U.S. based journalists would benefit from them, too, according to Munoz. For Jennifer Thomas, a journalism professor at Howard University in Washington, the training offered her the tools to better help her students to stay safe. 'Back when I was reporting locally and then nationally and covering news, we didn't have to really be that concerned when we went out to cover an event,' said Thomas, who previously worked at CNN. 'Well, times have changed.' During the training, Thomas and the others were introduced to a range of resources on issues including covering riots and dealing with an arrest. Munoz thinks this information will become all the more important for journalists in the U.S. in years to come.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-presidential-vote-looms-newsrooms-focus-on-how-to-stay-safe/7822912.html	2024-10-15T08:07:21-07:00	
Chinese Pandas arrive in US, headed to National Zoo in Washington	Washington — The National Zoo's long dark panda drought is coming to an end. Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas — Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new pair of bears arrived in the United States on Tuesday. They will be transported from Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia to the zoo. A pair of three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan before being flown to Washington, according to a statement by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. 'Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots, as well as water and medicine,' the statement said, adding that the partnership will 'make new contributions in protecting global biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two countries.' It's unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period before they are introduced to the public. On Monday evening, the zoo's website posted an alert that the entire facility would be closed Tuesday, without giving a reason. The lead article on the site still said the pandas would be coming sometime before the end of the year. Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities. The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic tensions. Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China last week. That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco. In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May, zoo director Brandie Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year. The Chinese announcement said the National Zoo had sent 'three experienced keepers and veterinary experts' to China to assist the transport and accompany the bears. Zoo officials on Monday declined to confirm the Chinese announcement. Zoo spokesperson Jennifer Zoon said in an email, 'For the safety of animals and staff, we are not able to confirm any details at this time.' But signs at the zoo and on its social media site have heralded the planned return of the pandas and panda-themed merchandise still dominates the gift shops. 'The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story, both for locals and incoming travelers alike,' said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. 'The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.' The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China before they reach age four. Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation's capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following President Richard Nixon's historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements, giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely vulnerable. 'The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,' Liu said in an email. 'We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-pandas-arrive-in-us-headed-to-national-zoo-in-washington/7822991.html	2024-10-15T07:50:47-07:00	
Kenya's High Court rejects move to stop deputy president's impeachment debate	NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya's High Court on Tuesday rejected an application by the deputy president's lawyers to stop the senate from debating an impeachment motion against him after parliament voted to remove him from office last week. Justice Chacha Mwita ruled that parliament will be allowed to proceed with its constitutional mandate and the court won't 'interfere.' Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua's impeachment motion was approved by a 281-44 vote in parliament last week and forwarded to the senate, which will begin hearings on Wednesday. Gachagua is facing impeachment over corruption and other irregularities, including allegations that he supported anti-government protests in June. He denies all the charges against him. Under the Kenyan Constitution, the removal from office is automatic if approved by both chambers, though Gachagua can challenge the action in court — something he has said he would do. The chief justice on Monday approved a three-judge panel to hear six petitions filed against the impeachment process. The debate surrounding his fate has extended beyond parliament — supporters and opponents of the motion clashed last week in public forums after the ruling alliance brought the motion before parliament. President William Ruto has yet to publicly comment about the impeachment, but is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying that he wouldn't publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, during their second term in office. The senate requires a two-thirds majority to approve the impeachment motion. If approved, it would be the first time that a sitting deputy president is impeached in Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-high-court-rejects-move-to-stop-deputy-president-s-impeachment-debate-/7822968.html	2024-10-15T07:34:58-07:00	
Shootout with Haitian, Kenyan police injures gang leader	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A leader of one of Haiti's most powerful gangs was injured in a shootout with Haitian and Kenyan police in their first major incursion into gang-controlled territory since a United Nations-backed mission began earlier this year, police said Tuesday. The second-in-command of the Kraze Barye gang, known simply as 'Deshommes,' was shot in Torcelle, a community the gang controls in the southeast region of the capital, Port-au-Prince, Haiti National Police said in a statement Tuesday. Some 20 other gang members were killed during the police operations, which occurred on Saturday and Monday, officials said, adding that they confiscated firearms, munitions, phones and 'sensitive materials and equipment.' Nobody was detained in the operations, and police didn't say how they know that Deshommes was injured. Police said the incursions would continue until the gang and its top leader, Vitel'Homme Innocent, could be neutralized. In a statement, the Kenyans who are leading the mission called on Innocent to 'stop committing atrocities against innocent Haitians.' '[The mission] is sending a strong warning to key gang leaders to stop the barbarous acts of rapes, extortion, kidnapping, blackmail and killings,' they said. Innocent has been sanctioned by the U.S., the European Union and the U.N. Security Council, with the U.S. offering a $2 million reward for information leading to his capture. He has been indicted in the U.S. for the armed kidnapping of 16 Christian missionaries in 2021 and the slaying of missionary Marie Franklin and kidnapping of her husband in 2022. In a recent video, Innocent stands near an armored vehicle set on fire that police said they were forced to abandon due to engine failure during one of their operations. Innocent claimed the gang was not giving police any problems and accused them of 'hurting too many innocent people.' He also said the gang has the power to decide who enters and leaves the community it controls. Kraze Barye is an ally of the G-Pep gang federation, an enemy of G9 Family and Allies, a different federation led by former elite police officer Jimmy Cherizier, best known as Barbecue. Kraze Barye has about 600 members and controls the community of Tabarre as well as parts of Petionville and Croix-des-Bouquets. The gang is accused of killings, drug and weapon trafficking, rapes, robberies and other crimes, according to the U.N., which called it 'one of the most powerful gangs' in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area. Kenyan officials pledged that 'the pressure will be sustained on the gangs until or unless they surrender to the authorities.' They also noted that operations are still ongoing in the central town of Pont-Sonde, where at least 115 people were killed by another gang earlier this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shootout-with-haitian-kenyan-police-injures-gang-leader/7822947.html	2024-10-15T07:18:43-07:00	
Pakistan hosts regional leaders for SCO summit under tight security	Islamabad — Leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization of Eurasian countries gathered in Pakistan Tuesday for an annual, two-day meeting to discuss ways to enhance regional security, stability, and development cooperation. Authorities have placed Islamabad under a security lockdown for the SCO gathering, deploying thousands of forces, including troops, in and around the Pakistani capital to protect the high-profile event due to a recent surge in deadly militant attacks. China and Russia established the SCO in 2001 as a way to counterbalance Western alliances in the areas of security, politics, and economics. Other members of the 10-state alliance are Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, India and Iran. Officials said that Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin are among several heads of government who will attend the meeting, which will be presided over by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the organization's current chair. Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the first vice president of Iran will represent their respective countries at the meeting. Jaishankar is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Islamabad in nearly a decade. Pakistan and India have both ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks during Jaishankar’s visit, emphasizing that the SCO is a 'multilateral' gathering, and neither side has requested such a meeting. Officials stated that Sharif would host a welcome dinner for SCO delegates on Tuesday. The summit proceedings will commence on Wednesday morning. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that Premier Li 'will have an in-depth exchange of view' with leaders of the participating countries on advancing the SCO’s 'practical cooperation,' among other issues. 'China believes that this meeting will produce positive outcomes and give a stronger boost to the security, stability, and development of regional countries,' Mao told reporters in Beijing. Analysts remain skeptical whether the SCO meetings have produced outcomes that would address concerns of member states, noting that Western alliances like NATO or the European Union offer members privileges such as mutual defense and economic integration. Security concerns surrounding Tuesday’s SCO meeting in Pakistan stem from a recent surge in militant attacks in the country. However, the deadly violence has primarily affected southwestern Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan. The Pakistani government has declared a three-day public holiday in Islamabad and the adjoining garrison city of Rawalpindi as part of security measures. Last week, two Chinese engineers were killed and another was injured when their convoy was hit by a suicide car bombing in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province. A separatist group from Balochistan claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. The slain foreigners were staff at a Chinese-funded coal-fired power plant under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure development bilateral collaboration stemming from Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative. Despite the deadly attack, Premier Li arrived in Islamabad Monday and held wide-ranging bilateral talks with Sharif before participating in the SCO meeting. The leaders also virtually inaugurated a CPEC-funded airport in Balochistan’s coastal city of Gwadar, which also houses a Chinese-run deep-water port on the Arabian Sea. Security concerns reportedly prompted the virtual inauguration of what officials described as Pakistan's second-largest airport, which China gifted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-regional-leaders-for-sco-summit-under-tight-security/7822956.html	2024-10-15T07:14:11-07:00

Microsoft: Cybercriminals increasingly help Russia, China, Iran target US, allies	WASHINGTON — Russia, China and Iran are increasingly relying on criminal networks to lead cyberespionage and hacking operations against adversaries such as the United States, according to a report on digital threats published Tuesday by Microsoft. The growing collaboration between authoritarian governments and criminal hackers has alarmed national security officials and cybersecurity experts. They say it represents the increasingly blurred lines between actions directed by Beijing or the Kremlin aimed at undermining rivals and the illicit activities of groups typically more interested in financial gain. In one example, Microsoft's analysts found that a criminal hacking group with links to Iran infiltrated an Israeli dating site and then tried to sell or ransom the personal information it obtained. Microsoft concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make money. In another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from Russia. Marriage of convenience For nations such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, teaming up with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues for profit and the promise of government protection. 'We're seeing in each of these countries this trend toward combining nation-state and cybercriminal activities,' said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust. So far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China and Iran are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber 'mercenaries' shows how far America's adversaries will go to weaponize the internet. Microsoft's report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June 2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations use hacking, spear phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a target's system. The company says its customers face more than 600 million such incidents every day. Russia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to enter military and government systems and spreading disinformation designed to undermine support for the war among its allies. Ukraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline. US elections targeted Networks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is working to oppose former President Donald Trump. Iran has also hacked into Trump's campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the war in Gaza. Russia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said. China, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue to target Taiwan and other countries in the region. Denials from all parties In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless and accused the U.S. of spreading its own 'disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.' In a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that 'our position is consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cybertheft in all forms.' Russia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they're using cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives of those three nations and North Korea were not returned Monday. Efforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response. Federal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures. But investigators at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be replaced. Within one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybercriminals-increasingly-help-russia-china-iran-target-us-allies-/7822907.html	2024-10-15T06:56:00-07:00	
UN: Drought from El Nino to blame for Southern Africa's worst hunger crisis in decades	CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Months of drought in southern Africa triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon have had a devastating impact on more than 27 million people and caused the region's worst hunger crisis in decades, the United Nations' food agency said on Tuesday. The World Food Program warned it could become a 'full-scale human catastrophe.' Five countries — Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have declared national disasters over the drought and resultant hunger. The WFP estimates that some 21 million children in southern Africa are now malnourished as crops have failed. Tens of millions in the region rely on small-scale agriculture that is irrigated by rain for their food and to make some money to buy provisions. Aid agencies warned of a potential disaster late last year as the naturally occurring El Nino led to below-average rainfall across the region, while its impact has been exacerbated by warming temperatures linked to climate change. 'This is the worst food crisis in decades,' WFP spokesperson Tomson Phiri said. 'October in southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April. 'Crops have failed, livestock have perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day.' The five countries that declared drought-related disasters have pleaded for international aid, while Angola on the west coast of Africa and Mozambique on the east coast are also 'severely affected,' Phiri said, showing the extent to which the drought has swept across the region. 'The situation is dire,' Phiri said. He said the WFP needs around $369 million to provide immediate help but has only received a fifth of that amid a shortfall in donations. The WFP has begun helping with food assistance and other 'critical support' on the request of various governments in the region, he said. Phiri noted southern Africa's crisis came at a time of 'soaring global needs' with humanitarian aid also desperately required in Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere. Other aid agencies have said this drought in southern Africa was especially harsh, with the United States aid agency, USAID, saying in June it was the most severe drought in 100 years during the January to March agricultural season, wiping out swathes of crops and food for millions. El Nino, a naturally occurring weather phenomenon which warms parts of the central Pacific, has different impacts on weather in different parts of the world. The latest El Nino formed in the middle of last year and ended in June. It was blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather. In southern Africa, food prices have risen sharply in many areas affected by the drought, increasing the hardship. The drought has also had other damaging effects. Zambia has lost much of its electricity and been plunged into hours and sometimes days of power blackouts because it relies heavily on hydroelectric power from the huge Kariba Dam. The water level of the dam is so low that it can hardly generate any power. Zimbabwe shares the dam and is also experiencing regular power outages. Authorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe have resorted to killing wildlife, including elephants, to provide meat for hungry people. Scientists say sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change because of a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Millions of African livelihoods depend on the climate, while poor countries are unable to finance climate-resilience measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-drought-from-el-nino-to-blame-for-southern-africa-s-worst-hunger-crisis-in-decades-/7822872.html	2024-10-15T06:40:14-07:00	
Frontex: Irregular EU border crossings fell 42% this year	Warsaw, — Detected irregular crossings into the European Union fell 42 percent in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, EU border agency Frontex said on Tuesday. Frontex released its latest statistics shortly before a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels later this week, where immigration is among topics high on the agenda. The number of detected crossings into the EU 'fell by 42 percent to 166,000 in the first nine months of this year,' Frontex said. It said the biggest falls were along the routes through the Western Balkans and Central Mediterranean. Nearly 17,000 would-be asylum seekers crossed into the 27-member EU via the Western Balkans, a 79-percent drop. Some 47,700 entered via the Central Mediterranean, a fall of 64 percent. By contrast, Frontex said crossings via the Western African route had doubled, reaching over 30,600 in the first nine months of the year. The biggest rise was registered at the EU's eastern land borders, including into Poland. Almost 13,200 crossings were detected, a 192-percent increase on January-September 2023. Poland and its Central European neighbor, the Czech Republic, called last week for EU restrictions that are tougher than those in the bloc's new pact on migration and asylum, which is due to come into force in 2026. The rules, adopted in May, aim to share the responsibility for hosting asylum seekers across the 27 countries in the EU and to speed up the deportation of people deemed ineligible to stay.	https://www.voanews.com/a/frontex-irregular-eu-border-crossings-fell-42-this-year/7822786.html	2024-10-15T04:53:34-07:00	
EU energy ministers discuss Ukraine energy crisis, Russian LNG	BRUSSELS — EU energy ministers met in Luxembourg on Tuesday to discuss the bloc's rising Russian liquified natural gas imports, Ukraine's energy shortages ahead of winter and how to balance energy prices across member states, officials said. The EU agreed on a 14th package of sanctions in June including a ban on transshipments of Russian gas as of March 2025 but stopped short of an outright ban. Since then, Belgium and the Netherlands have seen a sharp increase in imports. In a letter on Monday, France and nine other countries asked the European Commission to propose stricter reporting obligations on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) for storage companies and suppliers. 'Belgium will file and we will support an initiative to ban and track LNG imports from Russia more structurally,' Kai Mykkanen, Finland's climate and environment minister, told reporters ahead of the meeting. Soon after Moscow began its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU announced an effort towards phasing out Russian fossil fuels 'as soon as possible' without setting a date. 'We have seen in Belgium a doubling of LNG volumes. These are probably destined for security of supply within Europe but we have difficulty implementing this [14th] package that's why we are calling for a tracking system,' said Tinne van der Straeten, Belgium's energy minister. After the major Nord Stream pipeline was blown up in 2022, Russian LNG imports to the EU increased, while piped gas still flows via Ukraine and Turkey to central Europe. 'Some countries have internal issues clouding their judgment preventing a fast switch but it's been two and a half years so it's time to find an alternative,' Krzysztof Bolesta, Poland's state energy minister, said. The contract between Ukraine and Russia for gas flows via Ukraine is due to end in December. Ukraine ahead of winter The International Energy Agency said Ukraine's winter electricity shortfall could reach six gigawatts (GW), exacerbated by the end of the Russian pipeline deal. The Commission will update countries on Tuesday on efforts to extend the Russia-Ukraine pipeline deal. Ukraine said it does not want to continue while Russia said it is willing. The ministers will also look at practical ways to help Ukraine through the winter. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Russia had knocked the 'power equivalent of the three Baltic states' and aims to restore about 15% of Ukraine's needs. Poland said it was in talks with Ukraine's transmission companies to raise exports while Lithuania has dismantled a power plant, which is being rebuilt in Ukraine. The ministers will discuss former ECB bank governor Mario Draghi's competitiveness report, on which the incoming Commission is expected to draft its new Clean Industrial Deal. Europe's gas and power prices are higher than in the United State and elsewhere, and they vary considerably across the bloc. In September, the Greek prime minister asked the EU to urgently respond to soaring power prices in central and eastern Europe. Draghi advocated a faster deployment of cheaper green energy solutions. However, aging power grids, red tape, and limited cross-border infrastructure have hampered efforts. 'There is work to do on simplifying the authorization of grid projects, mobilizing funding and do more integrated planning,' EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-energy-ministers-discuss-ukraine-energy-crisis-russian-lng-/7822749.html	2024-10-15T04:25:48-07:00	
Russia, China bolster defense ties at 'substantive' talks	Russia and China held 'substantive' defense and military talks to bolster ties, Russia's defense minister said on Tuesday, as Moscow and Beijing cement a 'no limits' partnership and step up criticism of U.S. efforts to extend its influence in Asia. 'The military departments of Russia and China are united in their assessments of global processes, and they have a common understanding of what needs to be done in the current situation,' a post on the Russian defense ministry's Telegram messaging app cited Defense Minister Andrei Belousov as saying. Belousov said he met with China's central military commission vice chairman, Zhang Youxia for 'very substantive' talks. China's Defense Ministry said after the meeting that both sides hope to deepen and expand military relations and maintain high-level exchanges. Belousov's visit to Beijing took place as China's military vowed to take further action against Taiwan if needed after staging a day of war games it said were a warning to 'separatist acts' and which drew condemnation from the Taiwanese and U.S. governments. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' partnership in February 2022 when President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing less than three weeks before his forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, triggering the deadliest land war in Europe since World War II. In May this year, Putin and China's Xi Jinping pledged a 'new era' of partnership between the two most powerful rivals of the United States, which they cast as an aggressive Cold War hegemon sowing chaos across the world. Putin and Xi also agreed to deepen their 'strategic partnership,' Belousov said, without providing detail, adding he is confident that 'fruitful work and the adoption of significant, weighty decisions are ahead.' Russia said last week it was standing alongside China on Asian issues, including the criticism of the U.S. drive to extend its influence and 'deliberate attempts' to inflame the situation around Taiwan. The U.S. says China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine by supplying so-called dual use goods, including microelectronics, that can help it build weapons. China says it has not provided weaponry to any party, and that normal trade with Russia should not be interrupted or restricted.

Leaf-peepers are flocking to see New England's brilliant fall colors	MEREDITH, N.H. — New England leaf-watching season is in full swing, as people from as far as Florida and Berlin flock to the region for scenic drives, train rides and bus tours to soak in the splendid hues of red, orange and bronze. With quaint towns and covered bridges scattered through swaths of changing forest, the rural Northeast provides an ideal setting to view nature's annual show. 'Leaf-peeping is one of the most accessible tourism things that you can do,' said Teddy Willey, the general manager of the Frog Rock Tavern in Meredith, New Hampshire. 'You don’t have to have the athleticism to be a hiker, you don’t have to have the money to own a boat.' You just need to be able to jump in a car and head north, he said. 'Once you’re there, you just take it in,' Willey said. He spoke just after his tavern was flooded with tourists from Indiana who had stepped off a sightseeing bus. Among them was Vicky Boesch, of Fort Wayne, who had made the trip with her sisters. 'We came out to the Northeast to see the beautiful foliage and the colorful leaves,' she said, adding the she was impressed with Vermont. 'The leaves were very pretty on the mountains because the sun was out yesterday, and so that makes them pop more,' she said. It wasn't only the fall colors that provided a contrast with Indiana, she said, but also the region's distinctive architecture, lakes and towns. Gordon Cochran, of Lake View, Iowa, said he was in New Hampshire to visit his daughter and had a 'beautiful ride' on the slow-moving Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad. Weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf-peeping seasons. One problem is that global warming has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before they can reach their colorful peak. Willey acknowledges that he's not a leaf guy. 'Personally, no. I grew up here, so I think it loses its luster a little bit,' he said with a chuckle, adding that the season still has its moments. 'I’ll be driving somewhere around the Lakes Region, and all of a sudden, you're like, ‘You know what, there’s a reason why people come here and there’s a reason I live here. It really is quite beautiful,’' he said, referring to a scenic part of eastern New Hampshire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/leaf-peepers-are-flocking-to-see-new-england-s-brilliant-fall-colors-/7822688.html	2024-10-15T02:10:18-07:00	
Summit in Australia urges science to do more to embrace First Nations climate knowledge	SYDNEY — An international conference in Australia of First Nations people is calling on scientists to engage with Indigenous experts to find solutions to climate change. Indigenous Australians consider the land to be the mother of creation. To them, it is a living, breathing mass that contains secrets and wisdom. Tribal leaders have gathered in Dubbo, 390 kilometers northwest of Sydney, to urge governments and scientists to do more to harness the knowledge of First Nations peoples to combat climate change. In an official video, Glen Wingfield of the Kokatha Aboriginal Corporation in South Australia said the conference is part of a growing movement. 'We get on top of this (and) try to slow this global warming and all that stuff and get the message out to young people,' Wingfield said. 'We need more and more voices. If there is one or two people, you go and knock at the door, they tell you to go away. If you are going to come with a big mob, now they are going to start listening.' Indigenous communities around the world have relied on a deep understanding of their environments to survive. Kyle Whyte, professor of Environmental Justice at the University of Michigan, is attending the summit as a science envoy for the U.S. State Department. He has said previously that First Nations people around the world have already been through an environmental 'apocalypse' because of the theft of customary lands. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Tuesday that the impact of dispossession continues to this day. 'Going back several centuries it was Indigenous peoples’ lands that were first sacrificed to make way for mining and other industries that we now know are responsible for human-caused climate change,' he said. The Canadian government has set up a partnership with Indigenous people to help tackle climate change. In 2023, the Ottawa government said, 'First Nations, Inuit, and Métis in Canada are at the forefront of efforts to…adapt to the impacts of our changing climate.' In New Zealand, authorities have acknowledged that for many Indigenous Maori, climate change 'is not an isolated risk' but is 'intrinsically linked to other issues, such as social development needs, housing, environmental degradation…and poverty.' Indigenous elders have said that the First Nations people of Australia, who make up about 3% of the national population, contribute the least to climate change, 'yet the impacts of climate change are affecting us most severely.' The climate summit in Dubbo runs Oct 14-18 and is jointly run by the local Tubba-Gah Wiradjuri Aboriginal Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/summit-in-australia-urges-science-to-do-more-to-embrace-first-nations-climate-knowledge-/7822681.html	2024-10-15T01:54:34-07:00	
Iran condemns EU, UK sanctions on Tehran, denies providing ballistic missiles to Russia	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran condemned new EU and British sanctions on Tehran and denied providing ballistic missiles to Russia, spokesperson for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Esmaeil Baghaei, said in a post on X on Tuesday. The European Union agreed on Monday to impose sanctions on seven people and seven organizations, including airline Iran Air, for their links to Iranian transfers of ballistic missiles to Russia. The listings also include Saha Airlines and Mahan Air and Iran's Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari. At the same time, Britain added nine new designations under its Iran sanctions regime. Last month, the United States, citing intelligence it said had been shared with allies, said Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran for its war in Ukraine. Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson denied on Tuesday his country provided ballistic missiles to Russia. 'Some European countries and the UK have unfortunately claimed without evidence that Iran has militarily intervened in this conflict which is totally refuted,' Baghaei said, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war. Baghaei condemned the fresh sanctions saying that imposing new sanctions by the European Union and the UK on Iranian individuals and entities goes against international law. Also facing sanctions under the EU move are prominent officials from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and the managing directors of Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries and Aerospace Industries Organization. The sanctions include an asset freeze and a travel ban to the European Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-condemns-eu-uk-sanctions-on-tehran-denies-providing-ballistic-missiles-to-russia/7822672.html	2024-10-15T01:28:19-07:00	
Deadly Russian missile attack hits Mykolaiv	Officials in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region said Tuesday a Russian missile attack killed at least one person and injured 16 others. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram the attack damaged an infrastructure facility, restaurant and shopping areas, as well as residential buildings. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday that Russia’s overnight attacks included nine missiles and 17 drones, with Ukraine’s air defenses destroying 12 of the drones. The drone intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Poltava regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod, Kursk and Tula regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said an explosive device dropped from a drone hit a residential building and injured one person. NATO's secretary-general said Monday the alliance will continue to support Ukraine, despite threats from Russia. Speaking at NATO's Ukraine mission in Wiesbaden, Germany, Mark Rutte said the message for Russian President Vladimir Putin 'is that we will continue, that we will do what's necessary to make sure that he will not get his way. That Ukraine will prevail.' The NATO alliance is 'the strongest military alliance in world history, serving 1 billion people,' Rutte said. We stand ready to confront any threat. We will never get intimidated by our adversaries.' Monday was Rutte's first visit to the Ukraine mission known as NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, which will eventually take over the coordination of Western military aid to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address Monday that the Foreign Intelligence Service and the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine had delivered a 'quite detailed' report on 'the intentions of the Russians for the fall and winter' for their continuing invasion of Ukraine. The report included revelations about North Korea's involvement in the war and Russia's relationship with other countries that 'unfortunately, are investing in prolonging the war.' President Zelenskyy warned that 'whoever helps Russia, we will respond as toughly as necessary to defend Ukraine.' He said, 'There will be respective work with our partners to ensure that Russia's intentions do not work.' Zelenskyy added that this week, 'Ukraine will present to all our partners in Europe our strategy for compelling Russia to bring this war to a just end.' The strategy, known as the 'victory plan,' has not yet been made public. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-russian-missile-attack-hits-mykolaiv/7822668.html	2024-10-15T01:14:08-07:00	
Son of Singapore's founding PM Lee says plans to demolish family home	SINGAPORE — The youngest child of Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said on Tuesday he would apply to demolish the statesman's home in line with his wishes, following the death of Lee's daughter last week. Lee Kuan Yew's three children, one of whom is Singapore's third Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, were split on what to do with their father's home after his death in 2015, in a public spat that saw the siblings estranged. Eldest son Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down as Singapore's prime minister earlier this year, thought it should be up to the government to decide what to do with the property, including potentially retaining it as a heritage landmark. However his sister, Lee Wei Ling, who died on Oct. 9, and younger brother Lee Hsien Yang said the single-story bungalow, built in 1898 in central Singapore, should be demolished in accordance with their father's wishes. 'After my sister's passing, I am the only living executor of my father Lee Kuan Yew's estate,' Lee Hsien Yang wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. 'In his will, he wished for the house to be demolished 'immediately after' Wei Ling moved out of the house. It is my duty to carry out his wishes to the fullest extent of the law.' He said he would apply to demolish the house and planned to build a small private dwelling to be retained by the family, adding that it was time for the government to approve the demolition. The office of current Prime Minister Lawrence Wong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lee Kuan Yew told the Straits Times newspaper in 2011 that he wanted the house demolished because it would 'become a shambles' if it were opened to the public, and he hoped its removal would improve land values in the neighborhood. In 2018, a ministerial committee set up to consider the future of the house laid out three options, and said the decision would be left to a future government. The options were to retain the property by officially categorizing it as a national monument or for conservation, retain the basement dining room, which has the greatest historical significance and tear down the rest of the property, or allow the property to be fully demolished for redevelopment. At that time, Lee Hsien Loong said he accepted the committee's conclusion and the range of options laid out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/son-of-singapore-s-founding-pm-lee-says-plans-to-demolish-family-home/7822611.html	2024-10-14T23:27:18-07:00

Hong Kong policy address seen pivoting from security to economic growth	HONG KONG — Hong Kong is expected to announce measures to boost the city's economy in its annual policy address on Wednesday, including slashing liquor tariffs, as it seeks to revive the financial hub that has been struggling to recover since the pandemic. Hong Kong's small and open economy has felt the ripple effects of a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The city's economy expanded by 3.3% in the second quarter from a year earlier, and is forecast to grow 2.5-3.5% for the year. Although tourism numbers have rebounded since COVID, with 46 million visitors expected this year, consumption and retail spending remain sluggish, while stock listings have dried up and capital flight remains a challenge. In February, Hong Kong's financial secretary announced new measures spanning property, tourism and financial services, noting headwinds including a complex geopolitical environment and ballooning budget deficits. But in a meeting last month between China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Xia Baolong and Hong Kong leader John Lee, Xia emphasized a need for further 'reforms' to spur economic growth, in line with China's national strategy. He called on the Hong Kong government to 'unite and lead all sectors of society' to promote reforms, while urging businessmen to help in this drive. One commentator in the state-run China Daily said Xia's speech suggested a need for 'economic and social reforms.' Lee has said the focus this year would be on economic development and people's livelihoods. His government pushed through new national security laws in March which Lee said had improved stability. Some countries including the U.S. have criticized Lee for leading a years-long security crackdown that has jailed opposition democrats, shutdown liberal media outlets and curbed freedoms. Local media also reported possible plans to phase out some of Hong Kong's more squalid sub-divided flats, tiny cubicles that have been criticized as below acceptable living standards. Lee is also expected to push more tourism-related initiatives. On real estate, a key pillar of the economy, Lee is under pressure to do more to revive a market that has fallen around a fifth from its 2021 peak. Some market players, including Midland Realty's Hong Kong residential CEO Sammy Po, have called for further cutting of red tape to help Chinese buyers, including younger ones on talent schemes, to transfer capital and secure mortgages. Liquor taxes could also be slashed from the current 100% - one of the highest rates globally - to try to turn the city into a spirits trading hub in the way that it became an Asian wine trading hub after wine duties were abolished in 2008. The move may benefit local bars and restaurants that have struggled since COVID, with many local residents now opting to travel across the northern border to the Chinese city of Shenzhen to dine more cheaply. Retail sales were down 7.7% for the first eight months of 2024 compared with the same period a year before.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-policy-address-seen-pivoting-from-security-to-economic-growth-/7822593.html	2024-10-14T22:29:24-07:00	
Petronas' exploration in South China Sea will continue, Malaysia PM says	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday reiterated that state energy firm Petronas will continue to conduct oil and gas exploration activities in Malaysia's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, despite objections from China. This includes exploration activities in Petronas' Kasawari gas development off Sarawak state on Borneo, he told parliament. 'We will continue, but we will not close the door on discussions with any country,' Anwar said. He said Malaysia had territorial disputes with many of its neighbors, including Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, and said undue focus was placed on its differences with China. 'We have issues but these issues do not affect diplomatic relations. These issues do not affect trade relations and close friendships with our neighbors,' he said. Anwar said last month Malaysia's exploration activities were within its territory and were not intended to be provocative or hostile towards China, following the media leak of a diplomatic note from Beijing. In the note, carried by a Philippine news outlet, Beijing asserted that Malaysia's oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea breached its territory. China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has deployed a fleet of coast guards deep into Southeast Asia, including the EEZs of Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Vietnam, complicating those country's exploration efforts. China rejects a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague that Beijing's expansive claims had no basis under international law. Petronas's oil and gas projects in the South China Sea have had several encounters with Chinese vessels in recent years. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a U.S. think tank, said in a report this month that Chinese coast guard vessels have made frequent visits to Malaysian exploratory wells off Sarawak this year, passing as close as 1,000 meters from gas production platforms at Timi, Kasawari, and Jerun. Petronas' Kasawari field holds an estimated 10 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves and commenced first production in August this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/petronas-exploration-in-south-china-sea-will-continue-malaysia-pm-says/7822580.html	2024-10-14T21:53:12-07:00	
Beijing’s fiscal stimulus gets mixed responses in Chinese stocks	Taipei, Taiwan — China’s stock markets had a volatile day on Monday, showing mixed responses to the finance ministry’s latest fiscal policies, released during a closely watched briefing over the weekend. Hong Kong shares dropped 0.75% while its mainland peers rebounded, including the Shanghai Composite’s 2.07% gain, although the rally slowed. While some investors remained hopeful on Beijing’s promise of fiscal support, analysts warned that the fiscal measures, along with the central bank’s monetary easing in late September, are neither aggressive enough nor growth boosting although they are in 'the right direction' to address structural issues facing the world’s second-largest economy. Disappointing fiscal stimulus 'Markets conversation has already started to come up with the consensus that monetary injection or interest rate cuts cannot fix the fundamental problem,' Raymond Yeung, the Hong Kong-based chief economist of Greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, told VOA on Saturday. He added that investors in China were left guessing on the size of the government’s stimulus. Prior to the weekend briefing, investors were reportedly hoping for a 2 trillion to 10 trillion yuan ($283 billion-$1.4 trillion) stimulus package as China had pumped 4 trillion yuan ($564 trillion) to bail out its economy in 2008. China’s Finance Minister Lan Foan, however, stayed mum on the size of the stimulus package Saturday, although he pledged support to defuse local debt risks, bolster the country’s sagging property market and hinted at a deficit increase for additional fiscal support, if needed. That, Yeung said, was a 'very conservative approach' since Beijing probably doesn’t want 'a stock market bubble,' yet it wouldn’t help Chinese stock investors assess their trade this week. Stimulus can’t fix the economy He also expected market corrections to continue, as investors are concerned over whether Beijing’s stimulus plan can make the immediate growth-boosting impact to reverse high unemployment rates and the economic slowdown. The central bank’s monetary easing failed to reduce inflation in September, with both consumer and producer price growth falling short of expectations and deflationary pressures continuing to worsen. China’s consumer price index, a key gauge of inflation, grew lower-than-expected by 0.4% last month, compared to August’s increase of 0.6%, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday. Also, China’s producer price index, which measures the cost of goods at the factory gate, fell by 2.8% in September, marking the 24th consecutive month of decline. But the monetary policy helped push China’s stock prices higher for seven consecutive trading days before they took the biggest dive since 2020 last Wednesday due to a lack of new stimulus measures. Stock market correction to continue? On Saturday, while some users of the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, shared Lan’s optimistic views toward China’s economic outlook, others expressed disappointment, saying that they expect Chinese shares to see a weeklong free fall. A Weibo user in Hunan, named 'adrianolove1999,' wrote that he expects to ‘’bottom fish’’ this Friday. ‘’Why Friday? Because the shares will have a five-day losing streak.' He Jiangbing, an economist based in Hubei, China, said, by his estimate, the finance ministry is planning at least 3.2 trillion yuan ($451 trillion) worth of bond issuances, which await a final approval from the standing committee of the National People’s Congress when it meets later this month. Those will include 1 trillion yuan ($141 trillion) to replenish six major state-run bank’s capital for lending, another 1.2 trillion yuan ($169 trillion) as debt relief for local governments and the remaining 1 trillion yuan ($141 trillion) as subsidies to boost consumption or reserved for the under-privileged class, he added. Given the central government’s financial difficulty, He describes the size of the stimulus plan as 'good enough' to help ease liquidity or boost share prices. Putting the cart before the horse But such money-printing measures won’t address the root cause of China’s economic slowdown, he said. 'The [Chinese] economy won’t be revived by such fiscal policy, which can only keep the economy from collapsing. This is putting the cart before the horse. Printing money won’t solve any problem,' the economist told VOA by phone. China needs to improve its relations with the world’s major economies, which in turn will boost its exports and stop the exodus of foreign businesses, especially at a time when two thirds of China-based Japanese companies have left, he said. China also needs to reverse its emphasis on state-run businesses and its earlier course of tightening regulatory oversight, which has been threatening the survival of private enterprises, he added. Without addressing these root causes first, he argued, China’s economy won’t recover.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-s-fiscal-stimulus-gets-mixed-responses-in-chinese-stocks/7822576.html	2024-10-14T21:30:06-07:00	
North Korea blows up parts of inter-Korean roads as tensions with South Korea soar	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said North Korea blew up the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use on Tuesday, as the rivals are locked in rising animosities over North Korea's claim that South Korea flew drones over its capital, Pyongyang. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a brief statement that North Korea blew up parts of the roads on Tuesday. It said South Korea's military is bolstering its readiness and surveillance posture but gave no further details. The explosions came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called a meeting with his top military and security officials. During the meeting, Kim described the alleged South Korean drone flights as the 'enemy's serious provocation' and laid out unspecified tasks related to 'immediate military action' and the operation of his 'war deterrent' for defending the country's sovereignty, the North's state media reported earlier Tuesday. North Korea earlier put frontline artillery and other army units on standby to launch strikes on South Korea, if drones from South Korea are found over North Korea again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un's push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. During the previous era of inter-Korean detente in the 2000s, the two Koreas reconnected two road routes and two rail tracks across their heavily fortified border. But their operations later were suspended one by one as the Koreas wrangled over North Korea's nuclear program and other issues. Last week, North Korea said it would permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers and laying mines along the border since earlier this year. They said North Korea has also planted mines and removed lamps along its sections of the inter-Korean roads and taken out ties on the northern side of the railways.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-blows-up-parts-of-inter-korean-roads-as-tensions-with-south-korea-soar/7822568.html	2024-10-14T21:16:51-07:00	
Taiwan details record surge in Chinese warplanes involved in war games	Taipai, Taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry on Tuesday detailed the surge in Chinese warplane activity around the island during war games the previous day, saying it had detected a record 153 Chinese military aircraft. China held a single day of what it called 'Joint Sword-2024B' drills on Monday as a warning to 'separatist acts,' following last week's national day speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that Beijing denounced. In its daily update on Chinese military activity around the island in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defense ministry said it spotted 153 Chinese military aircraft, updating a figure given on Monday evening of 125 which it had already said was a record high for a single day. Of those aircraft, according to a map the ministry released, 28 crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, which had previously served as an unofficial barrier and which China says it does not recognize. Other areas of activity included off Taiwan's southeastern coast, home to a major Taiwanese air base, and to the southwest of Taiwan, at the top part of the South China Sea where the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands are located. There were also 14 Chinese navy ships and 12 'official ships' - which refers to the coast guard and other military adjacent vessels - spotted, the ministry said. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Premier Cho Jung-tai said the drills were not just a Taiwan issue. 'Any drills without prior warning will cause great disturbance to peace and stability in the entire region,' he said. 'China's drills not only affect Taiwan's neighborhood, but also seriously affect the entire international navigational rights and air and sea space, so attracted the attention of other countries.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's territorial claims, and says only the island's people can decide their future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-details-record-surge-in-chinese-warplanes-involved-in-war-games/7822564.html	2024-10-14T21:00:32-07:00

Ailing and silenced in prison, Belarus activist symbolizes the nation's repression	TALLINN, Estonia — The last time any of Maria Kolesnikova's family had contact with the imprisoned Belarusian opposition activist was more than 18 months ago. Fellow inmates at the penal colony reported hearing her plead for medical help from inside her tiny, smelly cell. Her father, Alexander Kolesnikov, told The Associated Press by phone from Minsk that he knows she's seriously ill and tried to visit her several months ago at the facility near Gomel, where she is serving an 11-year sentence, but has failed whenever he goes there. On his last attempt, he said the warden told him, 'If she doesn't call or doesn't write, that means she doesn't want to.' The 42-year-old musician-turned-activist is known to have been hospitalized in Gomel in May or June, but the outcome was unclear, said a former prisoner who identified herself only as Natalya because she feared retaliation from authorities. 'I can only pray to God that she is still alive,' Kolesnikov said in an interview. 'The authorities are ignoring my requests for a meeting and for letters — it is a terrible feeling of impotence for a father.' Kolesnikova gained prominence when mass protests erupted in Belarus after the widely disputed August 2020 election gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office. With her close-cropped hair, broad smile and a gesture of forming her outstretched hands into the shape of a heart, she often was seen at the front of the demonstrations. She became an even greater symbol of defiance in September of that year when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces in the neutral zone at the frontier and tore up her passport, then walked back into Belarus. She was convicted a year later of charges including conspiracy to seize power. Natalya, whose cell was next to Kolesnikova’s before being released in August, said she had not heard her talking to guards for six months. Other inmates heard Kolesnikova's pleas for medical assistance, she said, but reported that doctors did not come for 'a very long time.' In November 2022, Kolesnikova was moved to an intensive care ward to undergo surgery for a perforated ulcer. Other prisoners become aware of her movements because 'it feels like martial law has been declared' in the cellblock, Natalya said. 'Other prisoners are strictly forbidden not only to talk, but even to exchange glances with Maria.' Her sister, Tatiana Khomich, said she was told by former inmates that the 5 feet, 9 inches Kolesnikova weighed only about 45 kilograms (100 pounds). 'They are slowly killing Maria, and I consider that this is a critical period because no one can survive in such conditions,' said Khomich, who lives outside Belarus. The last time Kolesnikova wrote from prison was in February 2023. Letters to her 'are ripped up before her eyes by prison personnel,' her sister said, relaying accounts from other former inmates. Kolesnikova, who before the 2020 protests was a classical flutist who was especially knowledgeable about baroque music, is one of several major Lukashenko opponents to disappear behind bars. The prisons department of the Belarusian Interior Ministry refused to comment on Kolesnikova’s case. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has repeatedly demanded Belarusian authorities take 'urgent protective measures' in relation to Kolesnikova and other political prisoners held incommunicado. In September, the European Parliament demanded that Belarus release all political prisoners. Former inmates say Kolesnikova wore a yellow tag that indicates a political prisoner. That marks them for additional abuse by guards and officials, rights advocates say. The human rights group Viasna counts about 1,300 political prisoners in Belarus, including the group's Nobel Peace Prize-winning founder, Ales Bialiatsky. At least six have died behind bars. 'It was too late to save Alexei Navalny (from prison in Russia), and it was too late for six people in Belarus. We and the Western world don't have much time to save Maria's life,' Khomich said. Amnesty International has begun a campaign to raise awareness about Kolesnikova's fate, urging people to take up her plight with Western officials and politicians. Other prominent opposition figures who are imprisoned and have not been heard from in a year or more include Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 election but was imprisoned; his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, took his place on the ballot and was forced to leave the country the day after the vote. Aspiring opposition candidate Viktar Babaryka also was imprisoned before the election as his popularity among prospective voters soared. Kolesnikova was his campaign manager but then joined forces with Tsikhanouskaya. Prominent opposition figure Mikola Statkevich and Kolesnikova's lawyer, Maxim Znak, are imprisoned and have not contacted the outside world since the winter of 2023. Lukashenko denies Belarus has any political prisoners. At the same time, in recent months he has unexpectedly released 115 prisoners whose cases had political elements; those released had health problems, wrote petitions for pardons and repented. Belarus is deeply integrated with Russia, and some observers believe Lukashenko is concerned about the extent of his dependence on Moscow, hoping to restore some ties with the European Union by releasing political prisoners ahead of a presidential election next year. 'Minsk is returning to the practice of bargaining with the West to try to soften sanctions and achieve at least partial recognition of the results of the upcoming presidential election,' said Belarusian analyst Alexander Friedman. 'Lukashenko’s regime is interested in not becoming part of Russia and therefore wants at least some communication with the West, offering to talk about political prisoners.' Lukashenko’s critics and human rights activists say they see no real change in government policy since all leading pro-democracy figures are still behind bars and authorities have seized three times as many opposition activists to refill the prisons. 'It is difficult to consider these pardons as a real thaw since the repressions continue, but the West should encourage Lukashenko to continue releasing political prisoners,' Khomich said. 'The regime is sending clear signals to Western countries about its readiness to release people, and it's very important that [the signal] is heard, and the opportunity is seized.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ailing-and-silenced-in-prison-belarus-activist-symbolizes-the-nation-s-repression/7822524.html	2024-10-14T18:31:06-07:00	
Pakistan hosts major security meeting as it struggles against rising insurgent violence	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is hosting a major security meeting this week, with senior leaders from longtime ally China and archrival India among those attending. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was established in 2001 by China and Russia to discuss security concerns in Central Asia and the wider region. But it’s Pakistan’s own security that is under the microscope. An attack on a foreign ambassadors’ convoy, violent protests by supporters of an imprisoned former prime minister and a bombing outside Pakistan’s biggest airport are signs the country is struggling to contain multiplying threats from insurgents. The meeting, which begins Tuesday in Islamabad, comes at a crucial time for the government. Here’s why: Armed groups are outpacing the army Pakistan says it has foiled attacks through intelligence-based operations and preventative measures. It frequently vows 'to root out terrorism.' But the frequency and scale of the recent violence give the impression that the government isn’t in control and raises questions about its ability to protect key sites and foreigners, let alone Pakistanis. In the last few weeks, separatists from Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province have killed Chinese nationals in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, as well as more than 20 miners in an attack on housing at a coal mine and seven workers in another attack. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, is better at mobilizing fighters in different areas, and its operational capabilities have increased. The group wants independence for the province. It’s not interested in overthrowing the state to establish a caliphate, which is what the Pakistani Taliban want. But the two groups have a common enemy — the government. Analysts have said the BLA is getting support from the Pakistani Taliban. But, even without an alliance, attacks in the southwest are becoming more audacious and brutal, indicating that the BLA’s tactics are evolving and taking the security apparatus by surprise. The Pakistani Taliban continue their shootings and bombings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. It could be difficult for militants to hit the meeting, given the security around it and the areas where delegates will stay. But they could still wreak havoc. Vehicles are often just waved through street checkpoints in Islamabad. Aside from government buildings and top hotels, body searches and under-vehicle scanners are rare. 'At stake for the entire state is the only mission: how to hold such an event peacefully,' said Imtiaz Gul, executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies. 'How to get it done without any unpleasant incidents taking place. It’s going to be a formidable challenge for the government to disprove the notion of failures within the security apparatus.' Pakistan is paying the price for shutdowns Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said last week that the national economy suffered cumulative daily losses of more than $684 million on account of recent agitation. He was referring to supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan reaching the heart of the capital, despite a suspension of cellphone service and placement of shipping containers at access points to the city. The shutdown hit most business sectors, the gig economy, point-of-sale transactions, commuters, students, workers and more. Pakistan can’t afford to incur such losses or deepen people’s grievances. It relies on International Monetary Fund bailouts and multibillion-dollar deals and loans from friendly countries to meet its economic needs. There are regular protests over energy bills and the cost of living. Despite people's hardships, authorities have declared a three-day holiday surrounding the meeting. There have been reports of the government ordering the closure of wedding halls, restaurants, hotels, cafes and markets in Islamabad and the neighboring garrison city Rawalpindi for security reasons. Officials denied the reports, but not very strenuously. 'Generally, high-profile conferences are meant to promote connectivity, trade and improve a country’s image,' said Gul. But not in this case because Islamabad won't look like a normal city, he said. 'It seems they lack innovative thinking,' Gul said. 'They are unable to use smart approaches, and that’s why the easier way is to shut everything down.' A seat at the table and saving face The last time Pakistan hosted a major conference was in March 2022, a month before Khan was kicked out of office and a new cycle of upheaval started. The country's security situation and political instability are two factors that have prevented it from holding big international events. Even its best-loved sport, cricket, has suffered. There was a 10-year absence of test matches after terrorists ambushed a Sri Lanka team bus in 2009, killing eight people and injuring players and officials. The meeting is Pakistan’s chance to shine, especially in front of its neighbor China, to whom it is in hock by several billion dollars and whose nationals are prime targets for armed groups, as well as India, which is sending its foreign minister to the country for the first time since 2015. India and Pakistan have fought three wars and built up their armies but also developed nuclear weapons. China and India fought a war over their border in 1962. Pakistan, unused to hosting such a high-level meeting, will have to put its best face forward. Senior defense analyst Abdullah Khan said the government wants to show its international legitimacy amid the domestic crises. 'The presence of heads of state and other senior officials will itself be a success as Pakistan will come out of its so-called isolation,' said Khan. 'A peacefully held SCO will further improve the country’s image.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-hosts-major-security-meeting-as-it-struggles-against-rising-insurgent-violence/7822519.html	2024-10-14T17:51:14-07:00	
Europe's water security under threat, environment agency warns	Copenhagen, Denmark — Pollution, habitat degradation, climate change and overuse of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe, with only a third of its surface water in good health, the European Environment Agency warned Tuesday. 'The health of Europe's waters is not good. Our waters face an unprecedented set of challenges that threatens Europe's water security,' EEA executive director Leena Yla-Mononen said in a statement. Only 37% of Europe's surface water bodies achieved 'good' or 'high' ecological status, a measure of aquatic ecosystem health, the EEA report said. Meanwhile, only 29% of surface waters achieved 'good' chemical status over the 2015-21 period, according to data reported by EU member states. Europe's groundwaters — the source of most drinking water on the continent — fared better, with 77% enjoying 'good' chemical status. Good chemical status means the water is free of excessive pollution from chemical nutrients and toxic substances like PFAS and microplastics. Surface water is threatened by air pollution — such as coal burning and car emissions — as well as the agriculture industry, whose dumped waste contaminates the soil. 'European agriculture needs to increase its use of more sustainable organic and agro-ecological practices, accompanied by incentives and a change in our food and dietary habits,' the report said. The European agency analyzed 120,000 surface water bodies and 3.8 million square kilometers (1.5 million square miles) of groundwater body areas in 19 EU countries and Norway. It called on EEA member states to halve their use of pesticides by 2030. 'We need to redouble our efforts to restore the health of our valued rivers, lakes, coastal waters and other water bodies, and to make sure this vital resource is resilient and secure for generations to come,' Yla-Mononen said. Climate change effects, including extreme droughts and flooding, and the overuse of freshwater resources are putting a strain on Europe's lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwaters 'like never before,' the EEA said. Governments must prioritize reducing water consumption and restoring ecosystems, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-s-water-security-under-threat-environment-agency-warns-/7822511.html	2024-10-14T17:44:17-07:00	
North Korea's Kim holds security meeting as tensions with Seoul soar	SEOUL, SOuth Korea — North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un convened a top national security meeting Monday, state media reported, directing a plan of 'immediate military action' at a time of spiking tensions with the South. The meeting in Pyongyang was attended by the country's top security officials, including the army chief and other military officials, as well as the ministers of state security and defense. 'He set forth the direction of immediate military action and indicated important tasks to be fulfilled in the operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defense,' the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. The meeting comes as the nuclear-armed North has accused Seoul of flying drones over its capital and moved troops to its border, with South Korea saying Monday it was 'fully ready' to respond if fired upon. Officials at the meeting in Pyongyang heard a report on the 'enemy's serious provocation,' KCNA reported, an apparent reference to the drone flights. Kim 'expressed a tough political and military stand' at the meeting, state media said. The North has accused Seoul of being responsible for the drones, which dropped propaganda leaflets filled with 'inflammatory rumors and rubbish,' and warned on Sunday that it would consider it 'a declaration of war' if another drone was detected. Seoul's military initially denied it was behind the flights, with local speculation centered on activist groups in the South that have long sent propaganda and U.S. currency northward, typically by balloon. The United Nations Command, which oversees the armistice that ended active fighting in the 1950 to 1953 Korean War, said it was aware of the North Korean claim. 'The command is currently investigating the matter in strict accordance with the Armistice Agreement,' it said. The two Koreas remain technically at war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-holds-security-meeting-as-tensions-with-seoul-soar/7822509.html	2024-10-14T17:28:47-07:00

Britain to allow drones to inspect power lines, wind turbines	london — Britain's aviation regulator said Tuesday that it would allow drones to inspect infrastructure such as power lines and wind turbines, a move the authority has described as a significant milestone. The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had said earlier this year that it wanted to permit more drone flying for such activities as well as for deliveries and emergency services. It selected in August six projects to test it. Drones inspecting infrastructure will now be able to fly distances beyond remote flyers' ability to see them. 'While some drones have been flying beyond visual line of sight in the U.K. for several years, these flights are primarily trials under strict restrictions,' the CAA said. Under the CAA's new policy, some drones will be able to remain at low heights close to infrastructure where there is little or no potential for any other aircraft to operate. It will also reduce costs, the CAA said. Drones will inspect power lines for damage, carry out maintenance checks of wind turbines and even be used as 'flying guard dogs' for site security. The CAA will work with several operators to test and evaluate the policy, which according to the regulator's director, Sophie O'Sullivan, 'paves the way for new ways drones will improve everyday life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-to-allow-drones-to-inspect-power-lines-wind-turbines/7822493.html	2024-10-14T17:02:34-07:00	
UN: Over 400,000 children in Lebanon displaced in 3 weeks by war	BEIRUT — More than 400,000 children in Lebanon have been displaced in the past three weeks, a top official with the U.N. children’s agency said Monday, warning of a 'lost generation' in the small country grappling with multiple crises and now in the middle of war. Israel has escalated its campaign against the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group, including launching a ground invasion, after a year of exchanges of fire during its war with Hamas in Gaza. The fighting in Lebanon has driven 1.2 million people from their homes, most of them fleeing to Beirut and elsewhere in the north over the past three weeks since the escalation. Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director for humanitarian actions, has visited schools that have been turned into shelters to host displaced families. 'What struck me is that this war is three weeks old and so many children have been affected,' Chaiban told The Associated Press in Beirut. 'As we sit here today, 1.2 million children are deprived of education. Their public schools have either been rendered inaccessible, have been damaged by the war or are being used as shelters. The last thing this country needs, in addition to everything else it has gone through, is the risk of a lost generation.' While some Lebanese private schools are still operating, the public school system has been badly affected by the war, along with the country's most vulnerable people, such as Palestinian and Syrian refugees. ″What I’m worried about is that we have hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian children that are at risk of losing their learning,' Chaiban said. More than 2,300 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes, nearly 75% of them over the last month, according to the Health Ministry. In the last three weeks, more than 100 children were killed and over 800 were wounded, Chaiban said. He said displaced children are crammed into overcrowded shelters where three or four families can live in a classroom separated by a plastic sheet, and where 1,000 people can share 12 toilets. Not all of them work. Many displaced families have set up tents along roads or on public beaches. Most displaced children have experienced so much violence, including the sounds of shelling or gunshots, that they cower at any loud noise, Chaiban said. Then there is 'evacuation orders upon evacuation orders. We’re at the beginning, and already there’s been a profound impact,' he said. The escalation has also put over 100 primary health care facilities out of service, while 12 hospitals are either no longer working or partially functional. Water infrastructure has also come under attack. In the last three weeks, 26 water stations providing water to almost 350,000 people have been damaged, Chaiban said. UNICEF is working with local authorities to repair them. He called for civilian infrastructure to be protected. And he appealed for a cease-fire in Lebanon and in Gaza, saying there needs to be political will and a realization that the conflict cannot be resolved through military means. 'What we must do is make sure that this stops, that this madness stops, that there’s a cease-fire before we get to the kind of destruction and pain and suffering and death that we’ve seen in Gaza,' Chaiban said. With so many needs, he said, the emergency response appeal for $108 million in Lebanon has only been 8% funded three weeks into the escalation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-over-400-000-children-in-lebanon-displaced-in-3-weeks-by-war-/7822225.html	2024-10-14T16:24:16-07:00	
Kenya relocates 50 elephants to larger park, a sign poaching is under control	MWEA, Kenya — As a helicopter hovers close to an elephant, trying to be as steady as possible, an experienced veterinarian cautiously takes aim. A tranquilizer dart whooshes in the air, and within minutes the giant mammal surrenders to a deep slumber as teams of wildlife experts rush to measure its vitals. Kenya is suffering from a problem, albeit a good one: the elephant population in the 42-square-kilometer (16-square-mile) Mwea National Reserve, east of the capital Nairobi, has flourished from its maximum capacity of 50 to a whopping 156, overwhelming the ecosystem and requiring the relocation of about 100 of the largest land animals. It hosted only 49 elephants in 1979. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Erustus Kanga, the overpopulation in Mwea highlighted the success of conservation efforts over the last three decades. 'This shows that poaching has been low, and the elephants have been able to thrive,' Kanga said. Experts started relocating 50 elephants last week to the expansive 780-square-kilometer (301-square-mile) Aberdare National Park in central Kenya. As of Monday, 44 elephants had been moved from Mwea to Aberdare, with six others scheduled for Tuesday. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano oversaw the translocation of five of the elephants Monday, saying: 'This will go down in history as a record, as it is the biggest exercise of its kind. It is the first time we are witnessing the translocation of 50 elephants at a go.' The process started at dawn and involved a team of more than 100 wildlife specialists, with equipment ranging from specially fitted trucks to aircraft and cruisers. A fixed-wing aircraft conducted aerial surveillance to track down herds of elephants, which naturally move in small families of about five. The craft was in constant communication with two helicopters used to herd and separate the elephants to ensure they were relocated with their family units. Aboard one of the helicopters is a spotter, on the lookout for elephants, and a veterinarian with a tranquilizer gun. Once an elephant is sedated, a ground team of veterinary specialists and rangers rush to find it and clear thickets to make way for transport crews. Its vitals are monitored as another group of rangers works on lifting the massive animal, weighing hundreds of kilograms, onto specialized trucks, to be driven 120 kilometers (74 miles) to their new home. Kanga, the wildlife service director, said the relocation was also aimed at curbing human-wildlife conflict. Boniface Mbau, a resident of the area, said, 'We are very happy that the government has decided to reduce the number of elephants from the area. Due to their high numbers, they did not have enough food in the reserve, and they ended up invading our farms.' A second phase to relocate 50 other elephants is planned, but the date has not been disclosed. The project has cost at least 12 million Kenyan shillings ($93,000), the wildlife agency said. Kenya’s national parks and reserves are home to a variety of wildlife species and attract millions of visitors annually, making the country a tourism hotspot.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-relocates-50-elephants-to-larger-park-a-sign-poaching-is-under-control-/7822219.html	2024-10-14T16:05:47-07:00	
Half million still without power in Sao Paulo after Friday’s deadly storm	SAO PAULO, Brazil — Half a million consumers in Latin America's largest city are still without electricity three days after a violent gale knocked down power lines and caused a blackout, the distributor owned by Enel SpA said Monday. The delay in resumption of power supplies has led to criticism of the distributor from politicians and authorities, with calls to cancel the concession. Enel Sao Paulo said it would need time to restore parts of the electricity network that was damaged Friday night by winds of more than 100 kmh (62 mph). At least five people died in the storm that knocked over trees in the city's streets. Regulatory agencies Aneel and Arsesp said the company's response to the storm was 'much below expectations' and warned that they could recommend allowing Enel's contract to expire. Enel is facing similar criticism in Chile, whose government said in August it will study whether the Italian electricity distributor's local unit meets the terms of its concession to operate in the country after thousands of customers were left without power following a storm. According to Enel Sao Paulo, 537,000 consumers were still without electricity as of midday Monday. Blackouts that have occurred repeatedly since last year have angered Sao Paulo consumers and led authorities to fine the company for delays in restoring services. Enel's contingency plan calls for 2,500 people working to restore services in an extreme weather situation, but its field teams numbered 1,700 to 1,800 people 48 hours after the storm, Sao Paulo's state regulator for utilities Arsesp said. According to federal regulator Aneel, the company has been fined around 320 million reais ($57 million) since 2018, including 260 million reais ($46 million) related to extreme weather events since the end of last year, but payment was suspended by court order. The Ministry of Mines and Energy criticized Aneel for the current crisis, saying that the regulator had failed to supervise the distributor. Highlighting the weak response to the blackout, local media said more people were without electricity in Sao Paulo after the 15-minute storm than in Florida after Hurricane Milton.	https://www.voanews.com/a/half-million-still-without-power-in-sao-paulo-after-friday-s-deadly-storm/7822208.html	2024-10-14T15:46:30-07:00	
German secret services alarmed by Russian threat	berlin — Increased acts of espionage and sabotage, possible direct military confrontation with NATO as early as 2030: German secret services sounded the alarm Monday about the growing danger they believe Moscow's interference in Germany and Europe represents. It was a bleak picture that the three heads of the German intelligence services painted Monday during their annual hearing before MPs. 'It's burning almost everywhere,' said the head of the Federal Intelligence Service (BfV), Thomas Haldenwang, regarding threats from outside — Russia, China, Iran — as well as from within with radical Islam and the extreme right. Intelligence officials have been particularly vocal about Moscow's interference in Germany in the context of the war in Ukraine, where Germany is the second largest arms supplier after the United States. 'Whether we like it or not, we are in direct conflict with Russia,' said the head of the German intelligence and counterintelligence service (BND), Bruno Kahl. Package bomb? 'Russian espionage and sabotage are increasing in Germany, both quantitatively and qualitatively,' added Haldenwang. Germany has been rocked by several cases of alleged espionage for Russia, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In April, two men with Russian and German citizenship were indicted for planning acts of sabotage for Russia, including at a U.S. military base, to undermine German aid to Ukraine. Haldenwang accused Moscow of being behind the case of a parcel that caught fire at a DHL carrier center in Leipzig in July before its scheduled transport by plane. If the package 'had exploded on board during the flight,' he said, 'there would have been a crash and the debris could have affected all the people here in Germany who sympathize with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime, openly and secretly.' Haldenwang also mentioned disinformation campaigns and cases of use of spy drones. From a 'storm,' the Russian threat has 'become a real hurricane' which moves 'from east to west,' he added in a metaphor with the Baltic States and Poland, where Russian actions 'are much more brutal than they are currently here.' The head of the German military counterintelligence service (BAMAD), Martina Rosenberg, reported a 'significant increase in acts of espionage and sabotage' targeting the German army. Moscow is seeking to obtain information on 'deliveries of German arms to Ukraine' and to 'create a feeling of insecurity,' according to BAMAD. And the Kremlin 'is preparing for further escalation in hybrid and covert actions,' Kahl said. Red lines With these acts of interference of an 'unprecedented level,' the Kremlin wants to 'test the red lines of the West,' estimated the director of the secret services. For him, Russia will 'probably' be able 'to carry out an attack against NATO by the end of this decade.' 'A direct military conflict with NATO is becoming an option for Russia,' he added. Russia on Monday rejected the assertion by German's foreign intelligence chief that it would be able to attack NATO by the end of this decade, saying it was NATO that threatened Russia. Referring to successive waves of NATO expansion, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was NATO that had moved toward Russia, not the other way round. In an interview with the daily Handelsblatt, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser accused Moscow of acting 'in an ever more aggressive manner.' German services 'prevented possible explosive attacks' and 'demonstrated just a few months ago the seriousness of the Russian threat,' she also said. In July, the American channel CNN reported that the United States and Germany had foiled an assassination plot attributed to Russia against the head of the German industrial group Rheinmetall, which supplies arms to Ukraine. The accusations were rejected by Moscow. In August, fears of sabotage prompted security alerts at two military bases in Germany. The German government announced Wednesday parallel measures aimed at strengthening security controls, particularly on social networks, in the face of increased risks of espionage in ministries and sabotage of critical infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7822201.html	2024-10-14T15:28:42-07:00	
Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested outside New York Stock Exchange	NEW YORK — About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel's war in Gaza were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, police said. The protesters chanted 'Let Gaza live!' And 'Up up with liberation, down down with occupation!' in front of the stock exchange's landmark building in lower Manhattan. 'The reason we’re here is to demand that the U.S. government stop sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,' said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration. 'Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using U.S. bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices skyrocket.' A handful of counter protesters waved Israeli flags and tried to shout down the pro-Palestinian chants. None of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they sat down and waited to be taken into custody. A spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the protest. Police arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers. A police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not have details on the charges they faced. The protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of Hamas' surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and beyond. The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and it was not clear what the target was.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-pro-palestinian-protesters-arrested-outside-new-york-stock-exchange/7822191.html	2024-10-14T15:10:41-07:00	
Death toll in Bosnia's floods reaches 26	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina — The death toll from this month's devastating floods and landslides in Bosnia has reached 26 people, while rescue teams are searching for at least one more person still missing 10 days after a rainstorm caused havoc in the Balkan country, authorities said Monday. Torrential rains and winds hit four municipalities in central and southern Bosnia on October 4. Homes, roads and bridges were destroyed, leaving villages cut off without roads or power. Rescue teams have been sifting through the rubble for days, looking for those still missing. The hardest-hit area was in and around the southern town of Jablanica, where a village was buried in rocks from a quarry on a hill above. Local government said 19 people died in Jablanica, where a collective funeral will be held on Tuesday. Four people died in Konjic, east of Jablanica, and three more in Fojnica further north. Residents in the Jablanica area have said they heard a thundering rumble that woke them up in the middle of the night. They watched as houses disappeared before their eyes. The debris that was swept away from the flood-hit areas has clogged the otherwise perfectly clear, emerald green-colored Neretva River that is a favorite destination for visitors and locals alike. All kinds of debris, from pieces of wood to home appliances, has piled up by a hydroelectric dam on the Neretva, creating a virtual island of waste on the river and illustrating the devastation the floods have caused. Human-caused climate change increases the intensity of rainfall because warm air holds more moisture. This summer, the Balkans were also hit by long-lasting record temperatures, causing a drought. Scientists said the dried-out land has hampered the absorption of floodwaters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-bosnia-s-floods-reaches-26/7822187.html	2024-10-14T14:58:31-07:00	
Funeral held in Iraq for Iranian general killed by Israel with Nasrallah	Karbala, Iraq — A funeral procession took place Monday in the Shiite holy city of Karbala in central Iraq for General Abbas Nilforushan, who was killed in Lebanon along with the leader of the pro-Iranian Lebanese Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, during an Israeli strike on Beirut in late September, an AFP photographer noted. The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's ideological army, announced Friday that the body of General Nilforushan had been found, 'after continuous efforts,' at the site of the strike that targeted a Hezbollah stronghold in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sept. 27. His body was flown Monday from Beirut to Baghdad International Airport and then by ambulance to Karbala. The funeral procession headed to the Husseiniya shrine, where a representative of Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, led prayers in front of a large crowd. Participants waved flags of Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and the Iraqi armed faction Kataib Hezbollah, while chanting 'death to Israel.' The body will be transported to the holy city of Mashhad in Iran, according to the Sepah news agency, which is affiliated with the Guardians. Another ceremony will be held in Tehran on Tuesday, before a burial scheduled for Thursday in Isfahan, his hometown in central Iran, the agency said. Abbas Nilforushan was a top commander of the Quds Force, the elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards. The Revolutionary Guards had said that Iran's Oct. 1 strike of nearly 200 missiles on Israel was a retaliatory measure following the assassination of Nilforushan, Nasrallah and the leader of the Palestinian Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed on July 31 in Tehran in an attack attributed to Israel. Israel has vowed to retaliate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/funeral-held-in-iraq-for-iranian-general-killed-by-israel-with-nasrallah-/7822172.html	2024-10-14T14:39:25-07:00

Trump's campaign crowdfunded millions online in untraditional approach to emergency relief	NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump's campaign is using GoFundMe to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene's destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief. The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican nominee's national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million. They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts. Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed. But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party's presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical bills — to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes. 'It's pretty unusual and actually quite odd,' said Brett Kappel, a longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised both Republicans and Democrats. It's more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show U.S. Senator Tim Scott's 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane Ian hit South Carolina. Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the motivation arose from 'the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to give as much direct support as they can.' The finance team only got involved because of their 'great expertise in working with large accounts,' according to Hughes, and 'not one penny of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted.' Hughes said more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of Oct. 11. 'The president has an amazing movement of supporters,' Hughes told AP. 'With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a philanthropic effort from his supporters.' Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional salary for the Butler, Pennsylvania victims. Also contributing was The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025. GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust & Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith O'Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler, Pennsylvania, page, according to a company spokesperson. O'Rourke also provided a verified distribution plan, the GoFundMe spokesperson told AP, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients. Lawyer advises against It's not advisable for campaign finance officials to run crowdfunding pages 'at the same time they were writing your money for your camp,' said Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign finance. Because online crowdfunding is less regulated, he said, it would've been 'more palatable' to direct supporters toward a recognized nonprofit. 'But people get into trouble when they try to ascribe rationality or any degree of what we would generally consider best financial practices to campaigns,' Herman said. 'There's no black letter law that says they can't do this,' he added. 'Should they? Of course not.' The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made earlier this month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active, according to Hughes. The 'vast majority' has gone to the families of the three people shot, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he'd donated for the rally. Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four nonprofits. Samaritan's Purse spokesperson Gabrielle Bouquet said the Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump's 'steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus' name.' Bouquet declined to share the exact amount of the donation. Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the South Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations director Gregg Dinino did not specify the total. Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received $25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds were used to buy South Georgia businesses' gift cards because 'the best way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their hands.' 'Combustible dynamic' It makes sense that Trump's team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. The campaign 'has often been premised on a suspicion of institutions,' he said, and GoFundMe 'drew some of its attraction by serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving.' But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said. Crowdfunding pages don't have the same disclosure requirements as public charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings. Soskis said Trump's checkered philanthropic ventures have likely brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in 2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his interests. 'It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and charitable giving,' Soskis said. 'The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and Trump's own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that fire.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-campaign-crowdfunded-millions-online-in-untraditional-approach-to-emergency-relief-/7822163.html	2024-10-14T14:30:20-07:00

Italy sends 1st migrant ship to Albania, rights groups warn of 'dangerous precedent'	ROME — Italy is transferring the first group of migrants to Albania, the Interior Ministry said Monday, as part of a contentious plan to process thousands of asylum-seekers outside its borders. A naval ship departed from the island of Lampedusa with 16 men — 10 from Bangladesh and six from Egypt — who were rescued at sea after departing from Libya. The ship is expected to arrive Wednesday morning, a ministry spokesman said. Premier Giorgia Meloni's far-right government formally opened the two centers in Albania Friday where Italy plans to process thousands of male migrants requesting asylum after being intercepted in international waters while trying to cross to Europe. The centers can accommodate up to 400 migrants at first, with that expected to increase to 880 in a few weeks, according to Italian officials. Women, children, older people and those who are ill or victims of torture will be accommodated in Italy. Families will not be separated. The five-year deal was endorsed last year by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as an example of 'out-of-box thinking' in tackling the migration issue, but human rights groups say it sets a dangerous precedent. A spokesperson for the U.N. refugee agency, which has expressed serious concerns, said Monday that one of its teams was conducting an 'independent mission' on board the ship to monitor the screening process. The agency, also known as UNHCR, has agreed to supervise the first three months to help 'safeguard the rights and dignity of those subject to it.' The agreement, signed last year, calls for Albania to house up to 3,000 male migrants while Italy fast-tracks their asylum claims. The migrants will retain their right under international and EU law to apply for asylum in Italy and have their claims processed there. The two centers will cost Italy 670 million euros ($730 million) over five years. The facilities will be run by Italy and are under Italian jurisdiction, while Albanian guards will provide external security. Meloni and her right-wing allies have long demanded that European countries share more of the migration burden.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-sends-1st-migrant-ship-to-albania-rights-groups-warn-of-dangerous-precedent/7822127.html	2024-10-14T13:33:32-07:00	
Lilly Ledbetter, American icon of the fight for equal pay, dies at 86	New York — Lilly Ledbetter, an former Alabama factory manager whose lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, has died at 86. Ledbetter's discovery that she was earning less than her male counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter's case, years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous letter. Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue within 180 days of receiving each discrimination paycheck, not just the first one. 'Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,' Obama said in a statement Monday. 'Lilly did what so many Americans before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even higher for her children and grandchildren.' Ledbetter died Saturday of respiratory failure, according to a statement from her family cited by the Alabama news site AL.com. Ledbetter continued campaigning for equal pay for decades after winning the law named after her. A film about her life starring Patricia Clarkson premiered last week at the Hamptons International Film Festival. The team behind the film, 'LILLY,' issued a statement of condolence on social media. 'Lilly was an ordinary woman who achieved extraordinary things, and her story continues to motivate us all. We will miss her,' the team said. In January, President Joe Biden marked the 15th anniversary of the law named after Ledbetter with new measures to help close the gender wage gap, including a new rule barring the federal government from considering a person's current or past pay when determining their salary. Ledbetter had advocated for the measure in a January opinion piece for Ms. Magazine penned with Deborah Vagins, director of the Equal Pay Today advocacy group. But Ledbetter and other advocates for years have been frustrated that more comprehensive initiatives have stalled, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The sense of urgency among advocates deepened after an annual report from the Census Bureau last month found that the gender wage gap between men and women widened for the first time 20 years. In 2023, women working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared with men, down from 84 cents in 2022. Even before then, advocates had been frustrated that wage gap improvement had mostly stalled for the last 20 years despite women making gains in the C-suite and earning college degrees at a faster rate than men. Experts say the reasons for the enduring gap are multifaceted, including the overrepresentation of women in lower-paying industries and weak childcare system that pushes many women to step back from their careers in their peak earnings years. In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Ledbetter wrote a opinion piece in The New York Times detailing the harassment she faced as a manager at the Goodyear factory and drawing a link between workplace sexual harassment and pay discrimination. 'She was indefatigable,' said Emily Martin, chief program officer at the National Women's Law Center, which worked closely with Ledbetter. 'She was always ready to lend her voice, to show up to do a video, to write an op-ed. She was always ready to go.' Ledbetter was a manager at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, and had worked there 19 years when she received an anonymous note saying she was being paid significantly less than three male colleagues. She filed a lawsuit in 1999 and initially won $3.8 million in backpay and damages from a federal court. She never received the money after eventually losing her case before the Supreme Court. Although the law named after her didn't directly address the gender wage gap, Martin said it set an important precedent 'for ensuring that we don't just have the promise of equal pay on the books but we have a way to enforce the law.' 'She is a really an inspiration in showing us how a loss does not mean you can't win,' Martin said. 'We know her name because she lost, and she lost big, and she kept coming back from it and kept working until the day she died to change that loss into real gains for women across the country.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lilly-ledbetter-american-icon-of-the-fight-for-equal-pay-dies-at-86/7822132.html	2024-10-14T13:28:19-07:00	
12 killed, 33 injured in Egypt after bus with university students crashes	Cairo — A bus carrying university students crashed and overturned on a highway in northeastern Egypt, killing 12 people and injuring 33 others, the health ministry said Monday night. Students from the Suez-based Galala University, southeast of Cairo, were on board. Local media reported they were returning from their classes to their dormitory in Porto Sokhna resort, using the Ain Sokhna highway, when the accident happened, and that the driver was arrested as part of an investigation into the crash. The ministry didn't say what caused the accident. The statement said 28 ambulances rushed to the site and transported the injured to the Suez Medical Complex, but didn't disclose their condition. Deadly traffic accidents claim thousands of lives every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. Speeding, bad roads and poor enforcement of traffic laws mostly cause the collisions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-33-injured-in-egypt-after-bus-with-university-students-crashes-/7822133.html	2024-10-14T13:25:57-07:00	
Paris Motor Show opens during brewing EV trade war between EU, China	Paris — The Auto manufacturers competing to persuade drivers to go electric are rolling out cheaper, more tech-rich models at the Paris Motor Show, targeting everyone from luxury clients to students yet to receive their driving licenses. The biennial show has long been a major industry showcase, tracing its history to 1898. Chinese manufacturers are attending in force, despite European Union threats to punitively tax imports of their electric vehicles in a brewing trade war with Beijing. Long-established European manufacturers are fighting back with new efforts to win consumers who have balked at high-priced EVs. Here's a look at the show's opening day on Monday. More new models from China Chinese EV startups Leapmotor and XPeng showcased models they said incorporate artificial intelligence technology. Leapmotor, founded in 2015, unveiled a compact electric-powered SUV, the B10. It will be manufactured in Poland for European buyers, said Leapmotor's head of product planning, Zhong Tianyue. Leapmotor didn't announce a price for the B10 that will launch next year. Leapmotor also said a smaller electric commuter car it showcased in Paris, the T03, will retail from a competitive 18,900 euros ($20,620). Those sold in France will be imported from China but assembled in Poland, Zhong said. Leapmotor also announced a starting price of 36,400 euros ($39,700) in Europe for its larger family car, the C10. Sales outside of China are through a joint venture with Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker. Leapmotor said European sales started in September. Xpeng braces for tariff hit Attending the Paris show for the first time, the decade-old Chinese EV manufacturer XPeng unveiled a sleek sedan, the P7+. CEO He Xiaopeng said XPeng aims to deliver in Europe from next year. Intended European prices for the P7+ weren't given, but the CEO said they will start in China at 209,800 yuan, the equivalent of 27,100 euros, or $29,600. XPeng's president, Brian Gu, said the EU's threatened import duties could complicate the company's expansion plans if Brussels and Beijing don't find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline. Brussels says subsidies help Chinese companies to unfairly undercut EU industry prices, with Chinese-built electric cars jumping from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023. 'The tariff will put a lot of pressure on our business model. It's a direct hit on our margin, which is already not very high,' Gu said. Vehicles for young teens Manufacturers of small electric vehicles that can be driven in Europe without a license are finding a growing market among teens as young as 14 and their parents who, for safety reasons, prefer that they zip around on four wheels than on motorbikes. Several manufacturers of the two-seaters are showcasing in Paris, including France's Citroen. The starting price for its Ami, or 'Friend,' is just under 8,000 euros ($8,720). Launched in France in 2020, the plastic-shelled vehicle is now also sold in other European markets and in Turkey, Morocco and South America. 'It's not a car. It's a mobility object,' said Citroen's product chief for the Ami, Alain Le Gouguec. European legislation allows teenagers without a full license to drive the Ami and similar buggies from age 14 after an eight-hour training course. They're limited to a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour (28 mph). The vehicles are also finding markets among adults who lost their license for driving infractions or who never got a full license, and outside cities in areas with poor transport. Renault subsidiary Mobilize said that even in winter's energy-sapping cold its two-seater, no-license, plastic-shelled Duo can go 100 kilometers (over 60 miles) between charges. A phone app acts as its door and ignition key. Another French manufacturer, Ligier, sells its no-license two-seaters in both diesel and electric versions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paris-motor-show-opens-during-brewing-ev-trade-war-between-eu-china/7822118.html	2024-10-14T13:08:51-07:00	
Harris, Trump campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania Monday	Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will take their fight for Pennsylvania to opposite ends of the state on Monday, with Harris speaking in the northwest corner in Erie and Trump in the southeastern suburbs of Philadelphia. Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular appearances in what is the country's largest battleground state — it will be Harris' 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading. Pennsylvania's energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely topics as they compete for the fraction of the state's voters who have not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe Biden beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago. Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state's reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29. Harris plans to talk up early voting during her rally. And she'll stop by a Black-owned small business in Erie in advance of the rally to promote her proposals to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as Democrats try to energize the voting bloc. Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout among his supporters. Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday's scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns' public events. Michigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall' until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer. Democrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state's legislature is closely divided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-campaigning-in-battleground-pennsylvania-monday/7822096.html	2024-10-14T12:51:15-07:00	
NASA spacecraft rockets toward Jupiter's moon Europa, searching for keys to life	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a quest to explore Jupiter’s tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life. It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys. Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it. Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions. SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, floated off and called home. 'Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,' NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's flight director Pranay Mishra announced from Southern California. 'The science on this is really captivating,' NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean, 'and here we are looking that far out.' The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors. NASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated. Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission could proceed as planned. Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several days. 'What a great day. We’re so excited,' JPL Director Laurie Leshin said after liftoff. About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled, Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for gravity assists. The nearly 5,700-kilogram (13,000-pound) probe should reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030. Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to our own moon in size. The spacecraft will skim as low as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 15 kilometers to 24 kilometers (10 miles to 15 miles or more) thick. The ocean below could be 120 kilometers (80 miles) or more deep. The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034. 'Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be habitable, but they might be habitable today,' NASA’s Gina DiBraccio said on the eve of launch. If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean and geysers, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is another top candidate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacecraft-rockets-toward-jupiter-s-moon-europa-searching-for-keys-to-life/7822094.html	2024-10-14T12:48:16-07:00	
ICC prosecutor renews probe into alleged crimes in conflict-torn DR Congo	THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor said Monday he is renewing an investigation in Congo and focusing on allegations of crimes committed in the conflict-torn North Kivu province in the central African nation's east since early 2022. Eastern Congo has long been overrun by more than 120 armed groups seeking a share of the region’s gold and other resources as some carry out mass killings. The result is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced, many beyond the reach of aid. The most active rebel group has been M23, which rose to prominence more than a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal that it accuses Congo's government of not implementing. In August, clashes between the rebels and pro-government militias killed 16 villagers in a violation of the cease-fire announced in August to help millions displaced. The ICC first opened an investigation in Congo 20 years ago following years of armed conflict. Last year the Congolese government asked it to investigate alleged crimes in North Kivu by armed groups operating there since Jan. 1, 2022. In a statement, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said recent violence in North Kivu is 'interconnected with patterns of violence and hostilities that have plagued the region' since mid-2002. As a result, the more recent allegations fall into the ongoing investigation. Khan said his probe in North Kivu 'will not be limited to parties or members of specific groups. Rather, my office will examine holistically, independently and impartially the responsibility of all actors' allegedly committing crimes within the court's jurisdiction. The ICC previously convicted three rebels of crimes in Congo's eastern Ituri region, including a notorious warlord, Bosco Ntaganda, known as 'The Terminator' who was found guilty of crimes including murder, rape and sexual slavery. His convictions and 30-year sentence were upheld by appeals judges in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-renews-probe-into-alleged-crimes-in-conflict-torn-dr-congo/7822051.html	2024-10-14T12:36:31-07:00	
China urges caution in Israel-Iran tensions, calls for cease-fire	BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on all parties involved in tensions between Israel and Iran on Monday to exercise caution and avoid escalating the situation. In a phone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Wang also urged Israel to ensure the safety of personnel of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a foreign ministry statement said. He also reiterated Beijing's position on the Gaza conflict, calling for an immediate, complete and permanent cease-fire. Katz said that during the call he had 'clarified that Iran is the primary source for undermining stability in the Middle East' and said that Iran poses a direct threat through its proxies, including Hamas and Hezbollah. Katz said he had expected that China would express 'a balanced and fair position in relation to the war,' citing the economic cooperation ties between the two countries 'and the fact that approximately 20,000 workers from China continue to work in Israel during the ... war.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-caution-in-israel-iran-tensions-calls-for-cease-fire/7821998.html	2024-10-14T11:39:19-07:00	
Iran top diplomat meets senior Houthi official in Oman	Muscat, Oman — Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met a senior official from Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement in Muscat on Monday, according to his office, the latest stop in a wide-ranging diplomatic tour of the region. The Iranian foreign ministry released pictures of the talks with Mohammed Abdelsalam in the Omani capital as Araghchi consults with allies and other Middle East powers following Israel's vow to retaliate against an Iranian missile attack. Araghchi held a 'meeting and discussion with Mohammad Abdelsalam, the spokesman and chief negotiator of the Yemen National Salvation Government,' read the photo caption, referring to the Houthi administration. The Houthi-run Al Masirah television also reported the meeting without providing any details on the nature of the talks. Araghchi also met with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi to discuss developments in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip where Israel is fighting Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. They 'urged an immediate end to the Israeli regime's genocide and aggression in Gaza and Lebanon,' said Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei. Oman's foreign ministry said the two officials agreed on 'harnessing diplomacy as an essential tool for resolving disputes and conflicts' in the region. Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel on Oct. 1 in what it said was retaliation for the killing of Tehran-aligned militant leaders in the region and a general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Israel has since vowed to respond. Yemen's Houthis, along with the Palestinian Hamas group in Gaza and Hezbollah, are part of Iran's 'axis of resistance' of militant groups arrayed against Israel. Araghchi's visit to Muscat came after a trip to Baghdad. Last week, he visited Qatar and Saudi Arabia where talks mainly revolved around establishing a cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza as well as ways to contain the conflict from spreading across the region. On Sunday, Araghchi reiterated that Iran was 'fully prepared for a war situation ... but we do not want war, we want peace.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-top-diplomat-meets-senior-houthi-official-in-oman/7821979.html	2024-10-14T11:15:55-07:00	
Polish leader Tusk defends decision to suspend asylum law	Warsaw — Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday defended a plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as human rights and civil society organizations express concerns about the move. Poland has struggled since 2021 with migration pressures on its border with Belarus — which is also part of the European Union's external border. 'It is our right and our duty to protect the Polish and European border,' Tusk said Monday on X. 'Its security will not be negotiated.' Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of organizing the mass transfer of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to the EU's eastern borders to destabilize the West. They view it as part of a hybrid war that they accuse Moscow of waging against the West as it continues its nearly three-year full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some migrants have applied for asylum in Poland, but before the requests are processed, they travel across the EU’s border-free travel zone to reach Germany or other countries in Western Europe. Germany, where security fears are rising after a spate of extremist attacks, has recently responded by expanding border controls at all of its borders to fight irregular migration. Tusk called Germany’s move 'unacceptable.' Tusk announced his plan to temporarily suspend the right for migrants to seek asylum at a convention of his Civic Coalition on Saturday. It will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Dozens of nongovernmental organizations urged Tusk in an open letter to respect the right to asylum guaranteed by international conventions, which Poland signed, including the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and Poland's own constitution. They argued that fundamental rights and freedoms must be respected. 'It is thanks to them that thousands of Polish women and men found shelter abroad in the difficult times of communist totalitarianism, and we have become one of the greatest beneficiaries of these rights,' the letter said. It was signed by Amnesty International and 45 other organizations that represent a range of humanitarian, legal and civic causes. Tusk argued that Finland also suspended accepting asylum applications after facing migration pressure on its border with Russia. 'The right to asylum is used instrumentally in this war and has nothing to do with human rights,' Tusk said on X on Sunday. A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, acknowledged the challenge posed by Belarus, but also Russia, and didn't explicitly criticize Tusk’s approach. 'It is important and imperative that the union is protecting the external borders, and in particular from Russia and Belarus, both countries that have put in the past three years, a lot of pressure on the external borders,' Anitta Hipper said during a briefing Monday. 'This is something that is undermining the security of the EU member states and of the union as a whole.' But she also underlined that EU member countries are legally obliged to allow people to apply for international protection. Hipper noted that the commission intends to 'work on ensuring that the member states have the necessary tools to respond to these types of hybrid attacks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-leader-tusk-defends-decision-to-suspend-asylum-law/7821816.html	2024-10-14T09:06:16-07:00	
Taiwan's former President Tsai calls for release of publisher Jimmy Lai	Prague — Former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen is among the world leaders calling for the release of pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai from jail in Hong Kong, where he is standing trial on national security charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. 'They should release him,' Tsai told VOA about Jimmy Lai. She made the statement shortly after she delivered a speech at the Forum 2000 democracy conference in the Czech capital Prague on Monday. It was Tsai’s first international trip since leaving office in May. Tsai’s call for Lai’s release comes just weeks before Lai’s trial is set to resume on November 20, when he is expected to take the stand for the first time. Lai, the founder of Hong Kong’s now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. The 76-year-old British national is standing trial on charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition. The charges, which Lai rejects, are widely viewed as politically motivated. The British government recently asked to defer Tsai’s visit to the United Kingdom due to concerns that her visit would anger Beijing, according to media reports. British Foreign Minister David Lammy is expected to visit China next week in his first trip to the country as foreign secretary. A Foreign Office spokesperson told The Guardian: 'Ministerial travel will be confirmed in the usual way. We do not comment on speculation.' Jimmy Lai’s son Sebastien told VOA he hopes Lammy will raise his father’s case with the Chinese government during his upcoming visit. 'I’ll expect him to raise the case,' Sebastien said. 'At the end of the day, this is about saving my father’s life, and the foreign secretary is in a unique position to do that.' Although the United Kingdom has called for Jimmy’s release, the British government has faced criticism from rights groups and activists who say it isn’t doing enough to advocate on behalf of Jimmy, who is a British national. 'They’ve only been in power for four months,' Sebastien said, referring to Britain’s new Labour government. 'Dad’s been in jail for four years. So it’s not an excuse.' Sebastien spoke to VOA at Forum 2000, which he attended to advocate for his father’s release. 'Getting as much global attention on my father to put pressure on the government of Hong Kong so that they can’t keep essentially persecuting my father,' Sebastien said. Lai’s plight has come to symbolize the rapid deterioration of press freedom and other civil liberties in Hong Kong since China’s harsh national security law came into effect in 2020. Lai’s trial, which began in December 2023, was originally estimated to last around 80 days. Jonathan Price, a member of Jimmy’s international legal team, said he was concerned the trial could be delayed again. 'It doesn’t seem, to us, likely to finish anytime soon,' Price told VOA at Forum 2000. Price added that Lai’s trial highlights the lack of rule of law in Hong Kong. 'The proof about the rule of law in Hong Kong is in the pudding. If you’re shocked that there are 1,500 political prisoners in Russia, a country of 150 million people, you’d be staggered to learn that there are more political prisoners in Hong Kong,' Price said. The Washington-based Hong Kong Democracy Council estimates that there are more than 1,800 political prisoners in Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7.4 million. 'That itself is symptomatic of the total destruction of the rule of law,' Price said. Hong Kong's Security Bureau acknowledged receipt of VOA's email requesting comment for this story but did not provide a comment by time of publication. But in an October email to VOA, a Hong Kong government spokesperson denied that civil liberties and the rule of law have declined there. The spokesperson added that 'rights and freedoms are not absolute' anywhere in the world. 'In particular, journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticizing government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law,' the spokesperson said. Hong Kong authorities have also previously denied that Jimmy’s trial is unfair. Also at Forum 2000 in Prague, Miriam Lexmann, a Slovakian Member of European Parliament, told VOA that the European Union should do more to push for Lai’s release. 'It’s very important to talk about Jimmy Lai because it represents the case of Hong Kong very clearly. And what is absolutely vital now is that we address the issue of Hong Kong as Europeans,' said Lexmann, who also serves as co-chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, or IPAC. IPAC is a coalition of global lawmakers that is focused on relations with the Chinese government. Lai’s case is especially important, Lexmann said, because he could have left Hong Kong, but he decided to stay in order to stand up for freedom. 'He decided to stay and suffer just to show the case of what’s going on in Hong Kong,' Lexmann said. 'We have a moral responsibility to help those who fight for freedom worldwide. With his father’s trial set to resume shortly, Sebastien says now is an especially important time for governments to place more pressure on Hong Kong and China to release the publisher. 'We do see this as a critical time to raise attention for my father’s case,' Sebastien said. 'My goal is to release him as soon as possible because at his age, he could die at any moment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-former-president-tsai-calls-for-release-of-publisher-jimmy-lai/7821780.html	2024-10-14T08:42:38-07:00	
India recalls ambassador from Canada in growing dispute over assassination of Sikh activist	NEW DELHI — India said Monday it is recalling its ambassador and other diplomats from Canada, hours after it rejected a Canadian notification that the ambassador was a 'person of interest' in the assassination of a Sikh activist last year. India's foreign ministry said in a statement that it had also summoned the top Canadian diplomat in New Delhi and told him that 'the baseless targeting' of the Indian high commissioner, or ambassador, and other diplomats and officials in Canada 'was completely unacceptable.' 'We have no faith in the current Canadian Government's commitment to ensure their security,' it said. 'Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials.' In September last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were credible allegations that the Indian government had links to the assassination in that country of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India rejected the accusation as absurd. In Ottawa, messages left for Canada's foreign ministry, foreign minister and the prime minister's office seeking comment were not immediately returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-recalls-ambassador-from-canada-in-growing-dispute-over-assassination-of-sikh-activist-/7821760.html	2024-10-14T08:41:12-07:00	
EU targets Iran officials, airlines, for supplying drones, missiles to Russia	BRUSSELS — The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on Iran’s deputy defense minister, senior members of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and three airlines over allegations that they supplied drones, missiles and other equipment to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Defense Minister Seyed Hamzeh Ghalandari is one of seven senior officials now banned from traveling in Europe and whose assets in the bloc were frozen. The EU said he 'is involved in the development of Iran’s [drone] and missile program,' given his high-level defense role. Iran Air, Mahan Air and Saha Airlines had their assets frozen. The EU said their planes were 'used repeatedly to transfer Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles and related technologies to Russia, which have been used in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.' EU foreign ministers endorsed the sanctions at a meeting in Luxembourg. In March, the bloc had warned that 'were Iran to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology to Russia for use against Ukraine, the EU would be prepared to respond swiftly, including with new and significant restrictive measures.' EU member countries, except for Hungary, have been supplying weapons and ammunition as well as economic and other support to Ukraine worth some 118 billion euros ($129 billion) since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-targets-iran-officials-airlines-for-supplying-drones-missiles-to-russia-/7821710.html	2024-10-14T07:53:34-07:00	
French citizen convicted in Russia of collecting military information gets 3 years in prison	Moscow — A Russian court on Monday convicted a French citizen of collecting military information and sentenced him to three years in prison. Laurent Vinatier, who was arrested in Moscow in June, earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-tracked trial. His lawyers' asked the court to sentence him to a fine. In his remarks before the verdict, Vinatier, speaking Russian, reaffirmed that he fully recognized his guilt and asked the judge for clemency. 'I'm asking the Russian Federation to forgive me for failing to observe Russian laws,' he said in Russian. He said that he fell in love with Russia 20 years ago when he began studying the country and concluded his comments with a verse by Russian poet Alexander Pushkin about having patience that better days lie ahead. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia and its heavily politicized legal system since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier's arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following French President Emmanuel Macron's comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia's 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country's security. Vinatier is an adviser for the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. It said in June that it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The prosecutors charged that Vinatier had collected military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-22. The Russian citizens weren't named in the indictment. Vinatier's lawyers argued the sentence sought by prosecutors was too harsh and asked the judge to sentence him to a fine. They pointed at his career as a political scholar who focused on studying Russia and emphasized that his books and articles have been friendly to the country. While asking the judge for clemency, Vinatier pointed at his two children and his elderly parents he has to take care of. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-citizen-convicted-in-russia-of-collecting-military-information-gets-3-years-in-prison/7821709.html	2024-10-14T07:48:03-07:00	
World Bank cuts 2024 growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa over Sudan	Nairobi — The World Bank said on Monday it had lowered its economic growth forecast for sub-Saharan Africa this year to 3% from 3.4%, mainly due to the destruction of Sudan's economy in a civil war. However, growth is expected to remain comfortably above last year's 2.4% thanks to higher private consumption and investment, the bank said in its latest regional economic outlook report, Africa's Pulse. 'This is still a recovery that is basically in slow gear,' Andrew Dabalen, chief economist for the Africa region at the World Bank, told a media briefing. The report forecast next year's growth at 3.9%, above its previous prediction of 3.8%. Moderating inflation in many countries will allow policymakers to start lowering elevated lending rates, the report said. However, the growth forecasts still face serious risks from armed conflict and climate events such as droughts, floods and cyclones, it added. Without the conflict in Sudan, which devastated economic activity and caused starvation and widespread displacement, regional growth in 2024 would have been half a percentage point higher and in line with its initial April estimate, the lender said. Growth in the region's most advanced economy, South Africa, is expected to increase to 1.1% this year and 1.6% in 2025, the report said, from 0.7% last year. Nigeria is expected to grow at 3.3% this year, rising to 3.6% in 2025, while Kenya, the richest economy in East Africa, is likely to expand by 5% this year, the report said. Commodities The sub-Saharan Africa region grew at a robust annual average of 5.3% in 2000-2014 on the back of a commodity supercycle, but output started flagging when commodity prices crashed. The slowdown was accelerated by the COVID pandemic. 'Cumulatively, if that were to continue for a long time, it would be catastrophic,' Dabalen warned. Many economies in the region were starved of public and private investments, he said, and a recovery in foreign direct investments that started in 2021 was still tepid. 'The region needs much, much larger levels of investments in order to be able to recover faster... and be able to reduce poverty,' he said. Growth across the region is also hamstrung by high debt service costs in countries like Kenya, which was rocked by deadly protests against tax hikes in June and July. 'There are staggering levels of interest payments,' Dabalen said, attributing this to a shift by governments to borrow from financial markets in the last decade and away from the low-priced credit offered by institutions like the World Bank. Total external debt among economies has risen to about $500 billion from $150 billion a decade and a half ago, he said, with the bulk owed to bond market investors and China. Chad, Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia went into default in the last four years and have overhauled their debt under a G20 initiative Common Framework. Ethiopia is still working to restructure its debt while the others have completed their debt restructuring. 'As long as these debt issues are not resolved, there is going to be a lot of 'wait and see' games going on, and that is not good for the countries, and certainly not good for the creditors as well,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-cuts-2024-growth-forecast-for-sub-saharan-africa-over-sudan-/7821654.html	2024-10-14T07:34:14-07:00

Innocent' British nerve agent victim caught in global murder plot, inquiry finds	London — A British woman who died after being exposed to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok was unwittingly caught up in an 'illegal and outrageous international assassination attempt,' a public inquiry was told on Monday. Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three children, died in July 2018 after spraying herself with what she thought was perfume from a discarded bottle containing the deadly chemical weapon. Her death followed a failed poison attack against former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, southwest England. The U.K. government has said it was 'highly likely' Russia was behind the plot. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury in March 2018. They survived after intensive hospital treatment and now live under protection. At the start of public hearings into Sturgess's death in Salisbury, inquiry lawyer Andrew O'Connor said the perfume bottle contained enough Novichok to poison 'thousands' of people. 'It's no exaggeration to say the circumstances of Dawn Sturgess's death were extraordinary,' he told the hearing. 'When Ms Sturgess was poisoned by Novichok four months after the Skripal poisoning, the real possibility emerged that she had been caught — an innocent victim — in the crossfire of an illegal and outrageous international assassination attempt,' he added. U.K. authorities believe that agents targeting the Skripals threw the perfume bottle away, making the two cases 'inextricably interwoven'. The attempt to kill Skripal, on whom Russian President Vladimir Putin had sworn vengeance, plunged London-Moscow relations to a new low. Britain blames the Novichok attack on two Russian security service officers who allegedly entered the country using false passports. A third has been named as the operation's mastermind. All three are thought to be members of the GRU Russian intelligence agency. Russia, whose constitution does not allow extradition, has denied involvement and dismissed the inquiry as a 'circus.' Six years on, relations between the countries — already hit by claims that Russia was behind the 2006 radiation poisoning of former agent Alexander Litvinenko — remain in deep freeze. The Sturgess inquiry will include closed sessions to investigate 'private material' and intelligence related to the case. The Skripals will not give live evidence due to safety concerns. Sturgess's family was 'particularly concerned' about whether the U.K. government had taken appropriate steps to protect the Skripals and the wider public from collateral damage, according to O'Connor. International arrest warrants have been issued for the suspects, but Theresa May, who was prime minister at the time of the attack, warned justice was unlikely. She told the BBC last week that she hoped the inquiry would help 'the family and friends of Dawn Sturgess feel it has got to the truth.' But 'closure to all the people affected would only finally come with justice, and that justice is highly unlikely to happen,' May added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/innocent-british-nerve-agent-victim-caught-in-global-murder-plot-inquiry-finds/7821636.html	2024-10-14T06:57:51-07:00	
China’s Premier Li begins Pakistan visit amid rare strains in relations	ISLAMABAD — Chinese Premier Li Qiang began a four-day visit to Pakistan under tight security Monday for bilateral talks and to attend the heads of government meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) hosted in Islamabad this week. Pakistan is on high alert after a recent increase in deadly insurgent attacks nationwide, including a suicide car bomb attack in Karachi last week that targeted a Chinese convoy and resulted in the deaths of two Chinese engineers. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at a military air base outside the Pakistani capital before the two led their respective teams’ delegations to review bilateral trade and progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Popularly known as CPEC, the Chinese-funded multibillion-dollar bilateral project is a key extension of President Xi Jinping’s global Belt and Road Initiative. The Pakistani government has declared a three-day public holiday in Islamabad and the adjoining garrison city of Rawalpindi. Schools and businesses are closed, and troops and paramilitary forces have been deployed to ensure 'foolproof security arrangements' for the Li visit and the two-day SCO summit starting Tuesday. Officials said Li is also expected to virtually inaugurate the CPEC-built international airport in Gwadar, a coastal city housing a Chinese-controlled deep-water port on the Arabian Sea. Neither side has commented on the reason for the virtual inauguration, but diplomatic sources cited heightened security concerns, particularly following the Karachi attack. Li is the first Chinese premier to visit Islamabad in 11 years, with the Sharif administration saying the visit will help advance the development of CPEC and facilitate Chinese business expansion in the South Asian nation. China has invested nearly $25 billion over the past decade under CPEC, building large-scale infrastructure development projects in Pakistan, such as roads, highways, power plants, the Gwadar seaport, and the airport. However, critics are skeptical about whether the Chinese side would be keen to expand its business investments under CPEC, citing growing security threats to Chinese workers in Pakistan, among other challenges. Militant attacks have killed at least 21 Chinese nationals since 2017. Last week’s Karachi suicide bombing of Chinese engineers associated with a CPEC power plant prompted Beijing to ask its citizens not to visit Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Both sit on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan and witness almost daily insurgent attacks. On Monday, at least three police officers were killed when Islamist insurgents stormed a district police headquarters in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Authorities said that three assailants were also killed in the ensuing exchange of fire. Turning point Mushahid Hussain, a former senator and head of the Islamabad-based Pakistan China Institute, cautioned that the latest deadly attack on Chinese nationals was a severe blow and could be a 'turning point' for the 'strategic partnership' between the two countries. 'China has huge investments in strife-torn Nigeria and Congo, but never have we witnessed…murders of Chinese engineers and technicians… as we see these recurring in Pakistan,' Hussian noted. Hussian described the Karachi attack as a 'blatant breach of security' and echoed Chinese calls for Pakistani authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice urgently. 'China, our best friend, has been badly let down with their confidence shaken' despite Islamabad promising 'foolproof security' for its Chinese guests, he stated. Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the October 6th attack in Karachi, the capital of the southern Sindh province. The group has been waging deadly attacks in Balochistan, accusing China of helping Pakistan to exploit the region’s natural resources, charges both countries reject as unfounded. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters Monday that their government was doing all it could to ensure the security of the Chinese nationals in Pakistan. He stated that recent attacks on Chinese workers, including the Karachi bombing, 'are being probed, and the prime minister is personally looking into it.' In their post-attack meetings with Pakistani counterparts, Chinese officials appeared 'furious' and pressed the host nation to 'severely punish' the perpetrators and urgently enhance the security of Chinese nationals and projects, according to diplomatic sources privy to the discussions. Husnain Javed, a Beijing-based Pakistani researcher, told VOA that CPEC-related debt and capacity payments for Chinese-built coal-fired power plants are the main hurdles in moving the project forward. 'Pakistan is looking to defer these payments for a period of 3 years with interest and penalty amount…We are far from CPEC phase 2,' he stated in written comments. Javed noted that growing security concerns for thousands of Chinese workers in Pakistan have added to the bilateral project challenges. 'The recent attack, I think, is the final nail in the CPEC coffin as it heavily damaged the trust between the two countries…It's important to consider that these were no ordinary engineers,' the researcher noted. The Chinese foreign ministry said last week that a high-level team was sent to Islamabad after the attack. It 'asked the Pakistani side to properly handle ensuing matters…conduct thorough investigations, bring all the perpetrators to justice, and step up security measures to ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-premier-li-begins-pakistan-visit-amid-rare-strains-in-relations-/7821554.html	2024-10-14T06:17:10-07:00	
Historic Jersey Shore amusement park closes after generations of family thrills	OCEAN CITY, N.J. — For generations of vacationers heading to Ocean City, the towering 'Giant Wheel' was the first thing they saw from miles away. The sight of the 140-foot-tall (42-meter) ride let them know they were getting close to the Jersey Shore town that calls itself 'America's Greatest Family Resort,' with its promise of kid-friendly beaches, seagulls and sea shells, and a bustling boardwalk full of pizza, ice cream and cotton candy. And in the heart of it was Gillian’s Wonderland Pier, an amusement park that was the latest in nearly a century-long line of family-friendly amusement attractions operated by the family of Ocean City’s mayor. But the rides were to fall silent and still Sunday night, as the park run by Ocean City’s mayor and nurtured by generations of his ancestors, closed down, the victim of financial woes made worse by the lingering aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Superstorm Sandy. Gillian and his family have operated amusement rides and attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk for 94 years. The latest iteration of the park, Wonderland, opened in 1965. 'I tried my best to sustain Wonderland for as long as possible, through increasingly difficult challenges each year,' Mayor Jay Gillian wrote in August when he announced the park would close. 'It's been my life, my legacy and my family. But it's no longer a viable business.' Gillian did not respond to numerous requests for comment over the past week. Sheryl Gross was at the park for its final day with her two children and five grandchildren, enjoying it one last time. 'I've been coming here forever,' she said. 'My daughter is 43 and I've been coming here since she was 2 years old in a stroller. Now I'm here with my grandchildren.' She remembers decades of bringing her family from Gloucester Township in the southern New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia to create happy family memories at Wonderland. 'Just the excitement on their faces when they get on the rides,' she said. 'It really made it feel family-friendly. A lot of that is going to be lost now.' There were long lines Sunday for the Giant Wheel, the log flume and other popular rides as people used the last of ride tickets many had bought earlier in the year, thinking Wonderland would go on forever. A local non-profit group, Friends of OCNJ History and Culture, is raising money to try and save the amusement park, possibly under a new owner who might be more amenable to buying it with some financial assistance. Bill Merritt, one of the non-profit's leaders, said the group has raised over $1 million to help meet what could be a $20-million price tag for the property. 'Ocean City will be fundamentally different without this attraction,' he said. 'This town relies on being family-friendly. The park has rides targeted at kids; it's called ‘Wonderland’ for a reason.' The property's current owner, Icona Resorts, previously proposed a $150-million, 325-room luxury hotel elsewhere on Ocean City's boardwalk, but the city rejected those plans. The company's CEO, Eustace Mita, said earlier this year he would take at least until the end of the year to propose a use for the amusement park property. He bought it in 2021 after Gillian's family was in danger of defaulting on bank loans for the property. At a community meeting last month, Gillian said Wonderland could not bounce back from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the pandemic in 2020 and an increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage that doubled his payroll costs, leaving him $4 million in debt. Mita put up funds to stave off a sheriff's sale of the property, and gave the mayor three years to turn the business around. That deadline expired this year. Mita did not respond to requests for comment. Merritt said he and others can't imagine Ocean City without Wonderland. 'You look at it with your heart, and you say ‘You’re losing all the cherished memories and all the history; how can you let that go?'' he said. 'And then you look at it with your head and you say, ‘They are the reason this town is profitable; how can you let that go?’'	https://www.voanews.com/a/historic-jersey-shore-amusement-park-closes-after-generations-of-family-thrills-/7821517.html	2024-10-14T05:13:18-07:00	
UN refugee chief urges states to drop border controls even as displacement crises worse	Geneva — The head of the U.N. refugee agency warned on Monday that displacement crises in Lebanon and Sudan could worsen, but said tighter border measures were not the solution, calling them ineffective and sometimes unlawful. Addressing more than 100 diplomats and ministers in Geneva at UNHCR's annual meeting, Filippo Grandi said an unprecedented 123 million people are now displaced around the world by conflicts, persecution, poverty and climate change. 'You might then ask: what can be done? For a start, do not focus only on your borders,' he said, urging leaders instead to look at the reasons people are fleeing their homes. 'We must seek to address the root causes of displacement, and work toward solutions,' he said. 'I beg you all that we continue to work — together and with humility — to seize every opportunity to find solutions for refugees.' Without naming countries, Grandi said initiatives to outsource, externalize or even suspend asylum schemes were in breach of international law, and he offered countries help in finding fair, fast and lawful asylum schemes. Western governments are under growing domestic pressure to get tougher on asylum seekers and Grandi has previously criticized a plan by the former British government to transfer them to Rwanda. In the same speech he warned that in Lebanon, where more than one million people have fled their homes due to a growing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the situation could worsen further. 'Surely, if airstrikes continue, many more will be displaced and some will also decide to move on to other countries.' He called for a drastic increase in support for refugees in Sudan's civil war, saying lack of resources was already driving them across the Mediterranean Sea and even across the Channel to Britain. 'In this lethal equation, something has got to give. Otherwise, nobody should be surprised if displacement keeps growing, in numbers but also in geographic spread,' he said. The UNHCR response to the crisis that aims to help a portion of the more than 11 million people displaced inside Sudan or in neighboring countries is less than 1/3 funded, Grandi said. The number of displaced people around the world has more than doubled in the past decade. Grandi, set to serve as high commissioner until Dec. 2025, said the agency's funding for this year had recently improved due to U.S. support but remained 'well below the needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-refugee-chief-urges-states-to-drop-border-controls-even-as-displacement-crises-worse/7821495.html	2024-10-14T04:49:58-07:00	
Pro-European President Maia Sandu: a force for change in Moldova	Chisinau, Moldova — For many Moldovans, President Maia Sandu has become a symbol of change as she seeks to chart a new pro-European path for the former Soviet Republic. Since Moscow invaded Moldova's neighbor Ukraine, Sandu has lobbied for the West to support her country and hear its concerns that it could be the Kremlin's next target. She is now running for a second term on October 20 after defeating a Moscow-backed incumbent in 2020. Applying for Moldova to join the EU in 2022, Sandu, 52, has laid out wide-ranging reforms to fight graft and bring in investment. In stirring speeches, she has warned of a tough but worthy road ahead for one of Europe's poorest countries, with a population of 2.6 million. 'Joining the European Union is Moldova's Marshall Plan,' Sandu said in a speech last month, referring to the economic recovery plan put in place after World War II to rebuild Europe. 'Rollercoaster journey' Born in the village of Risipeni near the Romanian border before Moldova gained independence in 1991, Sandu obtained a master's degree in international relations in Chisinau and another in public policy after studying at Harvard University in the United States. After a stint in the economy ministry, she worked as an economist at the World Bank's office in Chisinau for more than seven years and later as an adviser of the executive director to the World Bank in Washington. After two years in Washington, in 2012, she received an 'unexpected' offer from Moldova's government to return and become education minister, kicking off what she has described as a 'rollercoaster journey' that ended up in her becoming the country's first woman president. 'The resistance to change, the overwhelming problems in the education sector, the hate speech I was confronted with, all made my life really difficult,' she recalled in a 2022 speech at Harvard University, describing how this built her 'resilience.' In her drive to rid her country of corruption, Sandu founded her own party in 2016, the center-right Action and Solidarity Party (PAS). 'It took quite some thought and ultimately a leap of faith to go into politics, instead of choosing a different, quiet and comfortable career path,' she said in her speech at Harvard. She ran for president in 2016, but failed to win. In 2019, she was Moldova's prime minister before trying for the post of president again, this time defeating Moscow-backed incumbent Igor Dodon. 'Chance for Moldova' Landlocked between Ukraine and EU member Romania, Moldova had long been divided over closer ties with the European Union or maintaining Soviet-era relations with Moscow. When Sandu was elected president, her promises of honesty and competence resonated with many Moldovans following political crises and corruption scandals. Sandu vowed balanced ties with the West and Russia, but relations with Moscow have increasingly soured since Russia invaded Ukraine, with Sandu accusing Moscow of meddling in her country's politics. Fluent in Romanian, English and Russian, Sandu enjoys the 'respect and recognition' of international leaders, according to Armand Gosu, a Romanian historian who specializes in former Soviet countries and Russia. Sandu is 'a huge chance for Moldova,' he said, noting she was likely the first Moldovan leader 'of such international stature.' Her critics accuse her of lobbying the West while having failed to manage the country's struggling economy and high inflation or to push forward judicial reforms. Sandu has been able 'to unite a large base of voters,' but also 'a relatively large core of disappointed people,' Florent Parmentier, a political scientist at French political studies school Sciences Po, told AFP. 'The main criticism of her is regarding her ability to listen' to opposing views, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-european-president-maia-sandu-a-force-for-change-in-moldova-/7821490.html	2024-10-14T04:40:47-07:00

Nobel economics prize awarded for research into why countries succeed or fail	STOCKHOLM — The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into reasons why some countries succeed and others fail. The Nobel memorial prize in economics was awarded Monday to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into differences in prosperity between nations. The three economists 'have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country's prosperity,' the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said at the announcement in Stockholm. 'Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better. The laureates' research helps us understand why,' it added. Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Robinson conducts his research at the University of Chicago. 'Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this,' Jakob Svensson, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences, said. He said their research has provided 'a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.' Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, where he is due to speak at a conference, Acemoglu said he was surprised and shocked by the award. 'You never expect something like this,' he said. The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes. Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel honors were announced last week in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-economics-prize-is-awarded-for-research-into-why-countries-succeed-or-fail-/7821460.html	2024-10-14T03:55:29-07:00	
North Korea preparing to destroy northern parts of inter-Korean roads, Seoul says	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said Monday it has detected signs that North Korea is preparing to destroy the northern parts of inter-Korean roads no longer in use, as the rivals are embroiled in soaring tensions over North Korea's claim that South Korea flew drones over its territory. Destroying the roads would be in line with leader Kim Jong Un's push to cut off ties with South Korea, formally cement it as his country's principal enemy and abandon the North's decades-long objective to seek a peaceful Korean unification. South Korea's military said Monday that it was observing various activities in North Korea that appeared to be preparations for demolishing the roads, such as installing screens. 'They have installed screens on the road and are working behind those screens, preparing to blow up the roads,' Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. He said the demolitions could be carried out as early as Monday. Lee said that the South Korean military believes that the North could also attempt to launch a space rocket, which is viewed by the U.N. as a banned test of long-range missile technology. Lee said North Korea may conduct unspecified 'small provocations' to ramp up pressure on Seoul. It's not clear how much parts of the roads North Korea would destroy. The development comes as North Korea has recently accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. In a statement Sunday, the North's Defense Ministry said that the military had ordered artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' The spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. North Korea often releases warlike rhetoric when animosities with its rivals increase. Experts say it's highly unlikely for North Korea to launch full-scale, preemptive attacks as it military is outmatched by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Koo Byoungsam, a spokesperson of South Korea's Unification Ministry, said Monday that North Korea's accusation on South Korean drone flights was likely aimed at creating tensions to reinforce its internal unity while stoking instability in South Korea. Koo said North Korea cannot win what it wants from South Korea with threats and provocations. Some observers say anti-Pyongyang activists might have sent drones this month, but North Korea argues the South Korean government cannot still escape responsibility because it must have been aware of such moves. In 2022, South Korea sent surveillance drones across the border into North Korea after it accused North Korea of flying drones into South Korea for the first time in five years. Last week, North Korea said it will permanently block its border with South Korea and build front-line defense structures to cope with 'confrontational hysteria' by South Korean and U.S. forces. It cited various military exercises in South Korea and the temporary deployments of powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea. South Korean officials said North Korea had already been adding anti-tank barriers, planting mines and reinforcing roads on its side of the border since earlier this year in a likely attempt to boost its front-line security posture and prevent its soldiers and citizens from defecting to South Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, with North Korea continuing a run of provocative missile tests and South Korea and the U.S. expanding their military drills. Observers say North Korea could perform major weapons tests ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to increase its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. In January, Kim Jong Un ordered the revision of North Korea's constitution to remove the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, formally designate South Korea as the country's 'invariable principal enemy' and define the North's sovereign, territorial sphere. Kim's order stunned many North Korea watchers because it was seen as breaking away with his predecessors' long-cherished dreams of peacefully achieving a unified Korea on the North's terms. Experts say Kim likely aims to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and seek direct dealings with the U.S. They say Kim also likely hopes to diminish South Korean cultural influence and bolster his rule at home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-preparing-to-destroy-northern-parts-of-inter-korean-roads-seoul-says-/7821445.html	2024-10-14T03:36:01-07:00	
Sri Lanka closes schools as floods hammer capital	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka closed schools in the capital Colombo and suburbs on Monday as heavy rains triggered floods in many parts of the island nation. Heavy downpours over the weekend have wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, flooding homes, fields and roads. Three people drowned, while some 134,000 people have been affected by flooding, according to the country's Disaster Management Centre. The center said rains and floods have damaged 240 houses and nearly 7,000 people have been evacuated. Authorities have cut electricity in some areas as a precaution. Navy and army troops have been deployed to rescue victims and provide food and other essentials. Local television channels showed flooded towns in the suburbs of Colombo. In some areas, waters reached the roofs of houses and shops. Sri Lanka has been grappling with severe weather conditions since May, mostly caused by heavy monsoon rains. In June, 16 people died due to floods and mudslides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-closes-schools-as-floods-hammer-capital-/7821441.html	2024-10-14T03:23:03-07:00	
Afghan Taliban vow to implement media ban on images of living things	Kabul — Afghanistan's Taliban morality ministry pledged Monday to implement a law banning news media from publishing images of all living things, with journalists told the rule will be gradually enforced. 'The law applies to all Afghanistan... and it will be implemented gradually' by persuading people images of living things are against Islamic law, spokesman for the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice Saiful Islam Khyber told AFP. The Taliban government judiciary recently announced legislation formalising their strict interpretations of Islamic law imposed by the authorities since they swept to power in 2021. The law detailed several rules for news media, including banning the publication of images of all living things and ordering outlets not to mock or humiliate Islam, or contradict Islamic law. Aspects of the new law have not yet been strictly enforced, however, and Taliban officials continue to regularly post photos of people on social media. Television and pictures of living things were banned across the country under the previous Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, but a similar edict has so far not been broadly imposed since their return to power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-vow-to-implement-media-ban-on-images-of-living-things/7821442.html	2024-10-14T03:22:33-07:00

Eight monkeys found dead at Hong Kong zoo, government says	HONG KONG — Eight animals were found dead in a Hong Kong zoo, the city's government said on Monday, a rare incident in the financial hub, with necropsy and laboratory tests arranged to find out the cause of deaths. The animals, a De Brazza’s monkey, one common squirrel monkey, three cotton-top tamarins and three white-faced sakis, were found dead at the city's Zoological and Botanical Gardens on Sunday, Hong Kong's Leisure and Cultural Services Department said in a statement. While awaiting test results, the mammals section of the zoo will be shut from Monday for disinfection and cleaning. 'We will also closely monitor the health conditions of other animals. During this period, other facilities of the HKZBG will remain open,' the statement said, using the abbreviation for the zoo and gardens. The zoo is the oldest park in the territory. Built in 1860, it houses around 158 birds, 93 mammals and 21 reptiles in about 40 enclosures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eight-monkeys-found-dead-at-hong-kong-zoo-government-says/7821370.html	2024-10-13T23:43:27-07:00

China starts new round of war games near Taiwan, offers no end date	TAIPEI — China's military started a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the 'separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces,' and offered no date for when they may conclude. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, had been on alert for more war games since last week's national day speech by President Lai Ching-te, an address Beijing condemned after Lai said China had no right to represent Taiwan even as he offered to cooperate with Beijing. The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command in a 5 a.m. statement said the 'Joint Sword-2024B' drills were taking place in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan. 'The drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity,' it said in a statement carried both in Chinese and English. Taiwan's defense ministry expressed its strong condemnation of China's 'irrational and provocative act,' adding it had dispatched its own forces. Lai's national day speech highlighted the current state of cross-strait relations, and the firm will to safeguard peace and stability and advocated future cooperation in coping with challenges like climate change, the ministry added. 'The Chinese communist's claim of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' is a complete departure from the truth,' it added. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said they believed China was practicing blockading Taiwanese ports and international shipping lanes as well as repelling the arrival of foreign forces. China's held the 'Joint Sword-2024A' drills for two days around Taiwan in May shortly after Lai took office, saying they were 'punishment' for separatist content in his inauguration speech. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-starts-new-round-of-war-games-near-taiwan-offers-no-end-date-/7821267.html	2024-10-13T18:09:30-07:00	
World Bank says 26 poorest countries in worst financial shape since 2006	WASHINGTON — The world's 26 poorest countries, home to 40% of the most poverty-stricken people, are more in debt than at any time since 2006 and increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters and other shocks, a new World Bank report showed on Sunday. The report finds that these economies are poorer today on average than they were on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the rest of the world has largely recovered from COVID and resumed its growth trajectory. Released a week before World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings get underway in Washington, the report confirms a major setback to efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and underscores the World Bank's efforts this year to raise $100 billion to replenish its financing fund for the world's poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA). The 26 poorest economies studied, which have annual per-capita incomes of less than $1,145, are increasingly reliant on IDA grants and near-zero interest rate loans as market financing has largely dried up, the World Bank said. Their average debt-to-GDP ratio of 72% is at an 18-year high and half of the group are either in debt distress or at high risk of it. Two-thirds of the 26 poorest countries are either in armed conflicts or have difficulty maintaining order because of institutional and social fragility, which inhibit foreign investment, and nearly all export commodities, exposing them to frequent boom-and-bust cycles, the report said. 'At a time when much of the world simply backed away from the poorest countries, IDA has been their lifeline,' World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill said in a statement. 'Over the past five years, it has poured most of its financial resources into the 26 low-income economies, keeping them afloat through the historic setbacks they suffered.' IDA normally is replenished every three years with contributions from World Bank shareholding countries. It raised a record $93 billion in 2021, and World Bank President Ajay Banga is aiming to exceed that with over $100 billion in pledges by Dec. 6. Natural disasters also have taken a greater toll on these countries over the past decade. Between 2011 and 2023, natural disasters were associated with average annual losses of 2% of GDP, five times the average among lower-middle-income countries, pointing up the need for much higher investment, the World Bank said. The report also recommended that these economies, which have large informal sectors operating outside their tax systems, do more to help themselves. This includes improving tax collections by simplifying taxpayer registration and tax administration and improving the efficiency of public spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-says-26-poorest-countries-in-worst-financial-shape-since-2006/7821293.html	2024-10-13T18:07:59-07:00	
International Wine Organization calls for ‘sustainable development’ of vines	dijon, France — The International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), a sort of 'U.N. of wine' which brings together experts from the sector, called for 'sustainable development' of the vine Sunday, following a ministerial meeting in France. 'The effects of climate change amplify' the challenges facing the vine, stressed 37 members out of 50 participating in the meeting at the OIV headquarters in Dijon. The signatories encourage 'biodiversity reservoirs, such as grape varieties and the entire ecosystem that surrounds them, by limiting soil erosion, capturing carbon ... and reducing waste,' adds the ministerial declaration, the first in the history of the organization which is celebrating its centenary this year. The OIV has set itself the 'objectives' of 'supporting innovation, ambitious, resilient and sustainable cultural and oenological practices ... as well as biodiversity such as the conservation and use of diversity in the vine, the exploitation of new vine varieties and efficient water management.' The 'sustainability' of vines and wine also applies to 'economic and social' matters, explained the director general of the OIV, New Zealander John Barker, at a news conference, stressing the need for the sector to adapt to the decline in wine consumption. Created on November 29, 1924, by eight countries (Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Tunisia), the OIV today brings together 50 countries, covering 88% of world wine production, with the notable absence of the United States, which slammed the door in 2001, after the failure of its candidate for its presidency. China will become the 51st member state in November. The organization is not political but brings together technical and scientific experts who exchange information on the sector and try to harmonize standards at the international level.	https://www.voanews.com/a/international-wine-organization-calls-for-sustainable-development-of-vines/7821288.html	2024-10-13T17:55:04-07:00

Iceland government collapses, new election set for November	Reykjavik, Iceland — Iceland's three-party coalition government collapsed Sunday over disagreements on policy issues, Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson said, with new elections to be held in November. Benediktsson, head of the conservative Independence Party, told reporters that tensions had mounted within the left-right coalition on issues ranging from foreign policy to asylum seekers and energy. The coalition had been made up of the Independence Party, the Left-Green Movement and the center-right Progressive Party. The issues 'were less discussed in the last election than need to be discussed now', Benediktsson said, emphasizing 'how different the (Left-Green) Movement's vision for the future is, compared to what I want to stand for.' 'It is best if the government has a common vision,' he told the online media site Visir, adding: 'It's disappointing when projects run aground or circumstances change.' He said he would meet Monday with Iceland's President Halla Tomasdottir to submit a proposal for the dissolution of parliament and parliamentary elections at the end of November. Benediktsson, one of Iceland's most experienced politicians, has previously served as finance minister, foreign minister and prime minister. He said he had strong backing from his party and planned to stand in the November election. A Gallup poll published on October 1 showed that the coalition government had the support of just one-fourth of voters, at 24.6 percent, the lowest score Gallup has recorded for an Icelandic government in 30 years. The three parties combined came in behind the Social Democrats, which were credited with 26.1 percent. Benediktsson took over as prime minister in April 2024 after Katrin Jakobsdottir, of the Left-Green Movement, resigned to run for the presidency, which she failed to win. The three parties were reelected in 2021, winning 38 of the 63 seats in parliament, up from the 33 they had held since the previous election in 2017. But the Left-Green Movement emerged weaker, losing three seats to hold just eight, while its right-wing partners both posted strong showings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iceland-government-collapses-new-election-set-for-november/7821281.html	2024-10-13T17:37:53-07:00	
Sweden wants EU to classify Revolutionary Guards as terrorist organization	Stockholm — Sweden wants the European Union to classify Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization after several attacks on Israeli targets in Sweden that Stockholm blames on Iran, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sunday. The Scandinavian country's intelligence agency, Sapo, has accused Iran of recruiting members of Swedish criminal gangs to commit 'acts of violence' against Israeli and other interests in Sweden, a charge Tehran has denied. 'We want Sweden to seriously address, together with other EU countries, the incredibly problematic connection between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its destructive role in the (Middle East) region, but also its increasing actions in various European countries, including Sweden,' Kristersson told the Expressen daily. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a special branch of the Iranian armed forces whose officers hold key positions within the Iranian government. 'The only reasonable option... is that we obtain a common classification of terrorists, so that we can act more broadly than with the sanctions that already exist,' he added. Several Israeli interests have been targeted in Sweden in recent months. In early October, the Israeli Embassy was targeted by gunfire, which did not cause any injuries. Other incidents have occurred near the embassy since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip in October 2023. In February, a grenade was found near the building in what the Israeli ambassador called an attempted attack. In May, gunfire was reported outside the building, leading to increased security measures around Israeli interests in Sweden. Two attacks have also targeted an Israeli military technology company in the past six months. In May, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter cited documents from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad indicating that the head of the Swedish crime network Foxtrot, Rawa Majid, and his arch-rival Ismail Abdo, head of the Rumba gang, were both recruited by Iran. In early October, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported that the two recent attacks on the Israeli Embassies in Stockholm and Copenhagen had been ordered by Foxtrot on the orders of Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-wants-eu-to-classify-revolutionary-guards-as-terrorist-organization/7821274.html	2024-10-13T17:22:32-07:00

Nigeria resettling people back to homes they fled to escape Boko Haram	DAMASAK, Nigeria — When Boko Haram launched an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria in 2010, Abdulhameed Salisu packed his bag and fled from his hometown of Damasak in the country's battered Borno state. The 45-year-old father of seven came back with his family early last year. They are among thousands of Nigerians taken back from displacement camps to their villages, hometowns or newly built settlements known as 'host communities' under a resettlement program that analysts say is being rushed to suggest the conflict with the Islamic militants is nearly over. Across Borno, dozens of displacement camps have been shut down, with authorities claiming they are no longer needed and that most places from where the displaced fled are now safe. But many of the displaced say it’s not safe to go back. Boko Haram — Nigeria’s homegrown jihadis — took up arms in 2009 to fight against Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law, or Sharia. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to U.N. numbers. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — shocked the world. Borno state alone has nearly 900,000 internally displaced people in displacement camps, with many others absorbed in local communities. So far this year, at least 1,600 civilians have been killed in militant attacks in Borno state, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit. And in a state where at least 70% of the population depends on agriculture, dozens of farmers have also been killed by the extremists or abducted from their farmland in the last year. In May, hundreds of hostages, mostly women and children who were held captive for months or years by Boko Haram were rescued from a forest enclave and handed over to authorities, the army said. In September, at least 100 villagers were killed by suspected Boko Haram militants who opened fire on a market, on worshippers and in people’s homes in the Tarmuwa council area of the neighboring Yobe state, west of Borno. Analysts say that a forced resettlement could endanger the local population as there is still inadequate security across the hard-hit region. Salisu says he wastes away his days in a resettlement camp in Damasak, a garrison town in Borno state of about 200,000 residents, close to the border with Niger. Food is getting increasingly difficult to come by and Salisu depends on handouts from the World Food Program and other aid organizations. He longs to find work. 'We are begging the government to at least find us a means of livelihood instead of staying idle and waiting for whenever food comes,' he said. On a visit last week to Damasak, Cindy McCain, the WFP chief, pledged the world would not abandon the Nigerian people as she called for more funding to support her agency's aid operations. 'We are going to stay here and do the very best we can to end hunger,' McCain told The Associated Press as she acknowledged the funding shortages. 'How do I take food from the hungry and give it to the starving,' she said. Resettlement usually involves the displaced being taken in military trucks back to their villages or 'host communities.' The Borno state government has promised to provide returnees with essentials to help them integrate into these areas, supported by aid groups. The government says the displacement camps are no longer sustainable. 'What we need now is ... durable solutions,' Borno governor Babagana Zulum told McCain during her visit. As the resettlement got underway, one in five displaced persons stayed back in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, and nearby towns but were left without any support for local integration, the Global Protection Cluster, a network of non-government organizations and U.N. agencies, said last December. Many others have crossed the border to the north, to settle as refugees in neighboring Niger, Chad or Cameroon. The three countries have registered at least 52,000 Nigerian refugees since January 2023, according to the U.N. refugee agency — nearly twice the number registered in the 22 months before that. A rushed closure of displacement camps and forced resettlement puts the displaced people at risk again from militants still active in their home areas — or forces them to 'cut deals' with jihadis to be able to farm or fish, the International Crisis Group warned in a report earlier this year. That could make the extremists consolidate their presence in those areas, the group warned. Boko Haram, which in 2016 split into two main factions, continues to ambush security convoys and raid villages. Abubakar Kawu Monguno, head of the Center for Disaster Risk Management at the University of Maiduguri, said the best option is for government forces to intensify their campaign to eliminate the militants or 'push them to surrender.' After not being able to access their farms because of rampant attacks by militants, some farmers in Damasak and other parts of Mobbar district returned to work their land last year, armed with seedlings provided by the government. Salisu was one of them. Then a major flood struck in September, collapsing a key dam and submerging about 40% of Maiduguri's territory. Thirty people were killed and more than a million others were affected, authorities said. Farms that feed the state were ruined, including Salisu's. His hopes for a good rice harvest were washed away. Now he lines up to get food at a Damasak food hub. 'Since Boko Haram started, everything else stopped here,' he said. 'There is nothing on the ground and there are no jobs.' Maryam Abdullahi also lined up at a WFP hub in Damasak with other women, waiting for bags of rice and other food items she desperately needs for her family of eight. Her youngest is 6 years old. The donations barely last halfway through the month, she said, but she still waited in the scorching heat. What little money she has she uses to buy yams to fry and sell to sustain her family, but it’s nowhere enough. Her only wish is to be able to get a 'proper job' so she and her children would feel safe, she said. 'We either eat in the morning for strength for the rest of the day or ... we eat only at night,' Abdullahi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-resettling-people-back-to-homes-they-fled-to-escape-boko-haram-/7820998.html	2024-10-13T16:57:13-07:00	
7 killed in third massacre in a week in Ecuador	Quito, Ecuador — Seven people were shot dead in Ecuador while leaving a pool hall in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat gang attacks near the violence-plagued port city of Guayaquil, police said Sunday. The third shooting in a week in the town of Duran brings the number of people killed to 17 in the flare-up in violence between two notorious local gangs, the Latin Kings and Chone Killers gangs, police said. The latest shooting took place Saturday night, when gunmen travelling in two cars opened fire on suspected members of the Chone Killers, Duran police chief Roberto Santamaria said. Traces of blood from the shooting were still visible on the streets Sunday. Santamaria blamed the attack on the rival Latin Kings gang, saying it appeared to be a revenge attack. The series of shootings began on Tuesday, when gunmen wearing army-style uniforms took five people from their homes and shot them dead execution-style in an alley in Duran. Police later blamed that attack on the Chone Killers. A day later, suspected members of the Chone Killers traveling by car opened fire on a group of people, also killing five. 'There has been a succession of violent acts that began with the death of five members of a gang, they seek retaliation with five other acts (killings) and so on,' Santamaria said. The Latin Kings and Chone Killers have a strong presence in Duran, which is situated just across the Babahoyo River from Guayaquil, the nerve center of a drug war between the government and powerful criminal groups. Santamaria described the Latin Kings and Chone Killers as having 'military-style power' and accused them of drug trafficking, extortion and the recruitment of minors, among other crimes. Duran is situated in Guayas province, one of six Ecuadoran provinces which is under a state of emergency due to gang violence. The capital Quito is included in the emergency measures. Violent crime in Ecuador, a country once seen as a beacon of stability in South America that has become a major drug trafficking hub, has skyrocketed in recent years. The murder rate went from six in 2018 to 47 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. The government says its crackdown on gangs who control the country's prisons is producing results, with murders falling to 4,959 between January and October this year, compared to 6,037 for the same period in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-third-massacre-in-a-week-in-ecuador/7820995.html	2024-10-13T16:48:40-07:00	
Lithuania's center-left opposition says it will try to form government	VILNIUS/PANEVEZYS, Lithuania — Lithuania's center-left opposition Social Democrats (SD) will attempt to form a majority coalition government together with two other parties following the country's parliamentary election, its leader said Sunday. Early results showed SD ahead in the election, which was dominated by concerns over living costs and potential threats from neighboring Russia. 'I think it will be a coalition with two left parties,' Vilija Blinkeviciute told reporters, adding the parties in question were the Farmers and Greens and For Lithuania. 'I think it will be a good left coalition.' With 61% of votes counted, SD had 22% support, making it the largest party ahead of the anti-establishment Nemunas Dawn with 17% and the ruling Homeland Union with 15%. Some 52.1% of the Baltic nation's eligible voters cast a ballot, up from 47.2% four years ago, official data showed. Blinkeviciute said foreign policy would not change and helping Ukraine remained a priority. 'I think that our voters, our people said that they want some changes,' she said, pointing to earnings, housing, health care and education as key areas of concern. Lithuania's center-right government of Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte saw its popularity eroded by inflation that topped 20% two years ago, as well as by deteriorating public services and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. 'I got bored with the old government. I want something new,' Hendrikas Varkalis, 75, said after casting his vote in Panevezys, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of the capital Vilnius. The Baltic state of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of the parliament is elected by popular vote, with a 5% threshold needed to win seats. The other half is chosen on a district basis, a process which favors larger parties. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in a district, its top two candidates face each other in a run-off on Oct. 27. Domestic issues loomed large in the election campaign, with the SD vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on health care and social spending. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which is part of the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad as well as with Belarus, a close Moscow ally. Three-quarters of Lithuanians believe Russia could attack their country soon, a Baltijos Tyrimai/ELTA poll found in May. The main parties strongly support Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces and back increased defense spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuania-s-center-left-opposition-says-it-will-try-to-form-government/7820996.html	2024-10-13T16:46:49-07:00	
Kenya says extra police ready for Haiti in early November	Nairobi, Kenya — An extra 600 Kenyan police officers set to join a U.N.-backed mission to try to quell rampant gang violence in Haiti will be ready for deployment in early November, Kenya's police chief said Saturday. President William Ruto had pledged the additional officers Friday following a meeting with Haiti's interim Prime Minister Garry Conille, as the two leaders appealed for the international community to do more. 'A contingent of 600 officers will soon join the Kenyan police already stationed in Haiti after completing pre-deployment training.' said Kenya's Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja. 'Once this training is complete, the officers will be ready for departure early next month,' he said at a media briefing alongside Conille in Nairobi. The East African country is leading the multinational mission aimed at tackling spiraling insecurity in the crime-ravaged Caribbean nation and has so far sent 400 police. Addressing concerns about delays in paying the salaries of officers already in Haiti, Kanja said, 'The payment issue has been sorted out, and the officers are happy.' On Friday, Ruto had urged the international community to 'urgently' rally behind the mission, which has been hobbled by a chronic lack of funding. 'This is the moment to provide that critical support for us to be able to undertake the exercise at hand,' he said in a call echoed by Conille. The Haitian leader's visit to Kenya comes a week after gang members opened fire in the Haitian town of Ponte Sonde, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the capital Port-au-Prince, butchering 109 people and wounding around 40 more. The U.N. Security Council last month extended the policing mission for one year, without transforming it into a U.N. peacekeeping mission as floated by Port-au-Prince. More than 3,600 people have been killed this year in 'senseless' gang violence in Haiti, according to the U.N. human rights office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-says-extra-police-ready-for-haiti-in-early-november/7820993.html	2024-10-13T16:39:00-07:00	
More relief for hurricane victims under way as misinformation continues to spread	On Sunday, President Joe Biden visited areas affected by Hurricane Milton in Florida and announced a half-billion dollars in new funding to improve electric grid resilience. But even as relief and recovery efforts continue, officials warn that misinformation is spreading rapidly as Election Day draws near. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias has the details, with reporting from Patrick Bresnan in North Carolina.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-relief-for-hurricane-victims-under-way-as-misinformation-continues-to-spread/7820988.html	2024-10-13T16:18:46-07:00	
Pakistani police fired tear gas, charge protesters in Karachi	Karachi, Pakistan — Pakistani police fired tear gas and swung batons at thousands of protesters Sunday in Karachi after the demonstrators tried to break through a security barricade. Around 2,000 supporters of a far-right Islamist party tried to reach the city’s press club to oppose another demonstration staged by civil society groups about the killing of a blasphemy suspect while he was in custody. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party hurled rocks at officers and torched a patrol car when police stopped them from reaching the press club. The party said one of its members died in the violence. Police arrested around 20 people from both demonstrations. Provincial Interior Minister Zia Ul Hassan said authorities feared clashes because both the political party and the civil society groups had issued calls for protests on the same day. Ul Hassan condemned the violence, especially given an upcoming security summit in Islamabad and last week’s deadly attack on a convoy of Chinese nationals outside the city's airport. The TLP supports Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws, which call for the death penalty for anyone who insults Islam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-police-fired-tear-gas-charge-protesters-in-karachi/7820984.html	2024-10-13T15:22:57-07:00	
Sri Lanka busts Chinese cybercrime racket	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's police have arrested 198 Chinese men on suspicion of operating a cybercrime ring from the South Asian nation, a police spokesperson said Sunday. Deputy Inspector-General Nihal Thalduwa said the men were taken into custody at four locations during raids carried out since October 6, with 129 arrested in one location Saturday. Thalduwa said that a large number of mobile phones and laptop computers were also seized. 'We suspect that they were operating online scams from these locations,' Thalduwa told reporters in the capital, Colombo. 'Their victims include people in Sri Lanka as well as those overseas.' He said investigations were moving slowly due to language issues in questioning the suspects, but the authorities have sought help of officials from the Chinese Embassy in Colombo. Forensic experts were analyzing the electronic devices that were seized, he said. In June, police arrested another 200 suspects, mainly Indians, who were also accused of operating online financial scams. Thalduwa said the suspects had entered the island as tourists and, in most cases, were overstaying their visas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-busts-chinese-cybercrime-racket/7820979.html	2024-10-13T14:52:59-07:00	
Chinese carmaker GAC considers making EVs in Europe as tariffs loom	Paris — Chinese state-owned carmaker GAC is exploring the manufacture of EVs in Europe to avoid EU tariffs, the general manager of its international business told Reuters on Sunday, joining a growing list of Chinese companies planning local production. The company is among China's largest automakers and is targeting 500,000 overseas sales by 2030. It does not yet sell EVs in Europe but will launch an electric SUV tailored to the European market at the Paris Auto Show, which kicks off Monday. GAC still viewed Europe as an important market that was 'relatively open' despite moves by the European Commission to impose tariffs on EVs made in China, Wei Heigang said, speaking in Paris ahead of the show. 'The tariffs issue definitely has an impact on us. However, all this can be overcome in the long term ... I am positive there is going to be a way to get it all resolved,' he said. 'Local production would be one of the ways to resolve this,' he added. 'We are very actively exploring this possibility.' Discussions were at a very early stage and the company was still considering whether to build a new plant or share — or take over — an existing one, according to Wei. The compact SUV on display in Paris, a 520-kilometer (323-mile) range vehicle called 'Aion V,' should launch in some European markets in mid-2025, priced at less than 40,000 euros ($43,748), though the final price has not yet been set, GAC said. After that launch, the next GAC vehicle due for sale in Europe will be a small electric hatchback, to be released in late 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-carmaker-gac-considers-making-evs-in-europe-as-tariffs-loom/7820966.html	2024-10-13T14:23:52-07:00	
Iran condemns 'illegal, unjustified' US sanctions on oil industry	Tehran, Iran — Iran condemned Sunday what it called an 'illegal and unjustified' expansion of U.S. sanctions targeting its oil industry following Tehran's missile attack on Israel earlier this month. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei defended Iran's attack on Israel and 'strongly condemned' the sanctions, saying they were 'illegal and unjustified.' The United States on Friday slapped Iran with a spate of new sanctions on the country's oil and petrochemical industry in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel. Baghaei defended Iran's attack on Israel as being legal and insisted on Iran's right to respond to the new sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department said it targeted Iran's so-called shadow fleet of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions. It said it had designated at least 10 companies and 17 vessels as 'blocked property' over their involvement in shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products. The State Department also announced it was placing sanctions on six further firms and six ships for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran'. Baghaei said 'the policy of threats and maximum pressure' had no impact on 'Iran's will to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interests and citizens against any violation and foreign aggressions.' He said the sanctions would enable Israel 'to continue killing innocents and pose a threat to the peace and unity of the region and the world'. The new wave of sanctions comes as the world awaits Israel's promised response to Tehran's missile attack, with oil prices hitting their highest levels since August. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden advised Israel against targeting oil infrastructure in Iran, one of the world's 10 largest producers. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi last Tuesday warned that 'any attack against infrastructure in Iran will provoke an even stronger response.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-condemns-illegal-unjustified-us-sanctions-on-oil-industry/7820962.html	2024-10-13T14:08:04-07:00	
Macron calls on Iran's president to back Mideast 'de-escalation'	Paris — French President Emmanuel Macron called on Iran's leader Masoud Pezeshkian to support a 'general de-escalation' in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon in a telephone conversation Sunday, his office said. Macron stressed 'the responsibility of Iran to support a general de-escalation and to use its influence in this direction with the destabilizing actors that enjoy its support.' Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters are fighting Israeli troops in Lebanon. The Iranian presidential website said that in his conversation with Macron, Pezeshkian had called for an end to 'crimes' in Lebanon and Gaza. They discussed ways to secure a 'cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel,' a statement on the website said. Pezeshkian 'asked the French president to work together with other European countries to force the Zionist regime to stop the genocide and crimes in Gaza and Lebanon,' the statement added. The Israeli army is engaged in close combat with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon this Sunday, where it announced for the first time the capture of an enemy fighter. It is also intensifying its airstrikes against the pro-Iranian formation. For its part, the Lebanese Islamist movement said it was fighting Israeli soldiers at the end of the afternoon 'with automatic weapons' and 'rockets' in at least four villages bordering Israel, with the Israeli army doing 'face to face combat.' After having weakened the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza, Israel moved the front of the war to Lebanon, saying it wanted to allow the return to northern Israel of some 60,000 inhabitants, displaced by the rocket attacks carried out for a year by Hezbollah in support for Hamas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-calls-on-iran-s-president-to-back-mideast-de-escalation/7820955.html	2024-10-13T13:44:03-07:00	
Iran, Iraq to hold funerals for general killed with Hezbollah chief	Tehran, Iran — Iran and Iraq will both stage funerals for Revolutionary Guard General Abbas Nilforushan, killed in an Israeli airstrike alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, the Guards' news agency said Sunday. Nilforushan, a top commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force foreign operations arm, was killed on September 27 alongside Nasrallah in the strike on south Beirut. The IRGC said Friday his body had been recovered from the site of the strike on the Lebanese capital's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold. Funeral ceremonies will be held in 'Najaf and Karbala' in Iraq on Monday before the body is transferred to Iran's holy city of Mashhad, the Sepah news agency said. Another ceremony will take place at Tehran's Imam Hossein Square on Tuesday before burial Thursday in the central city of Isfahan, his hometown, Sepah said. On October 1, Iran fired some 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Nasrallah, Nilforushan and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in late July. Israel said it carried out the Beirut strike but did not comment on Haniyeh's death in Tehran, where he had attended the inauguration of the Islamic Republic's new president. Israel has vowed to retaliate for the Iranian missile attack, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying the response would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-iraq-to-hold-funerals-for-general-killed-with-hezbollah-chief/7820952.html	2024-10-13T13:34:46-07:00	
North Korea: Front-line units could strike South Korea if more drones appear	Seoul, South Korea — North Korea said Sunday its front-line army units are ready to launch strikes on South Korea, ramping up pressure on its rival that it said flew drones and dropped leaflets over its capital Pyongyang. South Korea has refused to confirm whether it sent drones but warned it would sternly punish North Korea if the safety of its citizens is threatened. North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of launching drones to drop propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang three times this month and threatened to respond with force if it happened again. In a statement carried by state media Sunday, the North's Defense Ministry said that the military had issued a preliminary operation order to artillery and other army units near the border with South Korea to 'get fully ready to open fire.' An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the North Korea's military ordered relevant units to fully prepare for situations like launching immediate strikes on unspecified enemy targets when South Korea infiltrates drones across the border again, possibly triggering fighting on the Korean Peninsula, according to the statement. The spokesperson said that 'grave touch-and-go military tensions are prevailing on the Korean Peninsula' because of the South Korean drone launches. In a separate statement later Sunday, the spokesperson said that the entire South Korean territory 'might turn into piles of ashes' following the North's powerful attack. Also Sunday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un described as 'suicidal' the South Korean Defense Ministry's reported warning that North Korea would face the end of its regime if it harms South Korean nationals. She warned Saturday that the discovery of a new South Korean drone will 'certainly lead to a horrible disaster.' North Korea often issues such fiery, blistering rhetoric in times of elevated animosities with South Korea and the United States. Ties between the two Koreas remain tense since a U.S.-led diplomacy on ending North Korea's nuclear program fell apart in 2019. North Korea has since pushed hard to expand its nuclear arsenal and repeatedly threatened to attack South Korea and the U.S. with its nuclear weapons. But experts say it's unlikely for North Korea to launch a full-blown attack because its military is outpaced by the combined U.S. and South Korean forces. Observers predicted North Korea would escalate tensions ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election to boost its leverage in future diplomacy with the Americans. Since May, North Korea has floated thousands of balloons carrying rubbish toward South Korea in retaliation for South Korean activists flying their own balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets. South Korea's military responded to the North's balloon campaign by restarting border loudspeakers to blare broadcast propaganda and K-pop songs to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of Kim Jong Un and his family's dynastic rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-front-line-units-could-strike-south-korea-if-more-drones-appear/7820946.html	2024-10-13T13:10:19-07:00	
Thousands march in Spain to demand affordable housing	Madrid — Thousands protested Sunday in Madrid to demand more affordable housing amid rising anger from Spaniards who feel they are being priced out of the market. Under the slogan 'Housing is a right, not a business,' residents marched in the Spanish capital to demand lower housing rental prices and better living conditions. Twelve thousand people took to the streets, according to the Spanish government. 'Spaniards cannot live in their own cities. They are forcing us out of the cities. The government has to regulate prices, regulate housing,' said nurse Blanca Prieto, 33. In July, Spain's government announced a crackdown on short-term and seasonal holiday lettings. It plans to investigate listings on platforms such as Airbnb and Booking.com to verify if they have licenses. Spain is struggling to balance promoting tourism, a key driver of its economy, and addressing citizens' concerns over unaffordable high rents due to gentrification and landlords shifting to more lucrative tourist rentals. In a separate demonstration in Barcelona on Sunday against the America's Cup yachting race, protesters blamed the international sporting event for pushing up rental prices and bringing more tourists into an overcrowded city. Residents of the Canary Islands and Malaga have also staged protests this year against the rise in tourist rentals. Seasonal hospitality workers struggle to find accommodation in these tourism hot spots, with many resorting to sleeping in caravans or even their cars.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-spain-to-demand-affordable-housing/7820929.html	2024-10-13T12:37:21-07:00

US will send an air defense battery and American troops to Israel to bolster defenses against Iran	Washington — The United States will send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery and troops to Israel, the Pentagon said Sunday, even as Iran warned Washington to keep American military forces out of Israel. Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin authorized the deployment of the THAAD battery at the direction of President Joe Biden. Ryder said the system will help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's missile attacks on Israel in April and October. 'This action underscores the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran,' Ryder said. The Iranian warning came in a post on the social platform X long associated with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted the reports that the U.S. was considering the deployment. Israel is widely believed to be preparing a military response to Iran's Oct. 1 attack when it fired roughly 180 missiles into Israel. It was not immediately clear where the THAAD battery was coming from. The U.S. deployed one of the batteries to the Middle East along with additional Patriot battalions to bolster protections for U.S. forces in the region late last year after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas militants. Ryder also said that the U.S. sent a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training. According to an April report by the Congressional Research Service, the Army has seven THAAD batteries. Generally each consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, radio and radar equipment and required 95 soldiers to operate. The THAAD is considered a complementary system to the Patriot, but it can defend a wider area. It can hit targets at ranges of 150 to 200 kilometers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-send-an-air-defense-battery-and-american-troops-to-israel-to-bolster-defenses-against-iran-/7820840.html	2024-10-13T10:06:21-07:00

Train crash in Egypt kills 1, injures 21 people	Cairo — A locomotive crashed into the tail of the Cairo-bound passenger train Sunday in southern Egypt, killing at least one person and injuring multiple others, authorities said. It is the second train crash in a month in the North African country. The collision occurred in the province of Minya, 270 kilometers (about 168 miles) south of Cairo, the railway authority said in a statement, and two railway carriages fell into an adjacent watercourse. The cause of the crash was being investigated, the statement added. Footage aired by local media showed the two carriages partially submerged in the watercourse. Along with the fatality, the Health Ministry said in a separate statement at least 21 people were taken to hospitals, of which 19 were later discharged after receiving treatment. Train derailments and crashes are common in Egypt, where an aging railway system has also been plagued by mismanagement. In September, two passenger trains collided in a Nile Delta city, killing at least three people. In recent years, the government announced initiatives to improve its railways. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in 2018 some 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $8.13 billion, would be needed to properly overhaul the neglected rail network.	https://www.voanews.com/a/train-crash-in-egypt-kills-1-injures-21-people-/7820783.html	2024-10-13T08:37:26-07:00	
Ukraine's human rights envoy urges response to alleged killings of Ukrainian POWs in Kursk	Kyiv — Ukraine's human rights ombudsman urged international organizations Sunday to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia's Kursk region, where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. DeepState, a Ukrainian battlefield analysis site close to Ukraine's Defense Ministry, said Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian 'drone operators and contractors' on Oct. 10 after they had surrendered. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the claim, calling it 'another crime committed by the Russians.' Earlier this month, Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine said Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. There was no immediate response from Russian officials. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Sunday that its air defenses had shot down 31 of 68 drones launched at Ukraine by Russia overnight into Sunday in the regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Chernihiv, Sumy and Cherkasy. A further 36 drones were 'lost' over various areas, it said, likely having been electronically jammed. The air force added that ballistic missiles struck Odesa and Poltava while Chernihiv and Sumy came under attack by a guided air missile. Local authorities didn't report any casualties or damage. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that Russia had launched around 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 40 missiles and 400 drones against Ukraine over the past week. Zelenskyy appealed on social platform X to Ukraine's allies to 'provide the necessary quantity and quality of air defense systems' and 'make decisions for our sufficient range'. Kyiv is still awaiting word from its Western partners on its repeated requests to use the long-range weapons they provide to hit targets on Russian soil. In Russia, the Defense Ministry said that 13 Ukrainian drones were shot down over three regions of Russia: six each in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, and one in the Bryansk region, all of which border Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-human-rights-envoy-urges-response-to-alleged-killings-of-ukrainian-pows-in-kursk/7820719.html	2024-10-13T06:52:53-07:00	
Biden will view Hurricane Milton damage in Florida; Harris plans to go to church in North Carolina	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida's Gulf Coast by Hurricane Milton as he urges Congress to approve additional emergency disaster funding. Vice President Kamala Harris will spend a second day in North Carolina, hard-hit by Hurricane Helene, to attend a Black church and hold a campaign rally. Biden's visit to the St. Petersburg area offers him another chance to press House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for congressional approval of more aid money before the Nov. 5 election. Johnson has said the issue will be dealt with after then. 'I think Speaker Johnson is going to get the message that he's got to step up, particularly for small businesses,' Biden told reporters as he and Harris met with aides on Friday to discuss the federal response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Biden and Johnson have yet to discuss the matter directly. In Florida, Biden was set to announce $612 million for six Department of Energy projects in areas affected by the hurricanes to improve the resilience of the region's electric grid, the White House said. The funding includes $94 million for two projects in Florida: $47 million for Gainesville Regional Utilities and $47 million for Switched Source to partner with Florida Power and Light. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, visited Raleigh on Saturday to meet with Black elected and religious leaders and help volunteers package personal care items for delivery to victims of Helene in the western part of the state. She was spending Sunday in Greenville, with plans to speak during a church service as part of her campaign's 'Souls to the Polls' effort to help turn out Black churchgoers before Election Day. She was also scheduled to hold a rally to talk about her economic plans and highlight Thursday's start of early voting in the state, her campaign said. Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will spend the coming week campaigning in the competitive states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, according to a Harris campaign official who was not authorized to publicly discuss details not yet made public and spoke on condition of anonymity. With less than four weeks to go before Election Day, the hurricanes have added another dimension to the closely contested presidential race. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said the Biden administration's storm response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Biden and Harris have hammered Trump for promoting falsehoods about the federal response. Trump made a series of false claims after Helene struck in late September, including incorrectly saying that the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. He also falsely claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for immigrants in the country illegally. Biden said Trump was 'not singularly' to blame for the spread of false claims in recent weeks but that he has the 'biggest mouth.' The president is pressing for swift action by Congress to make sure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. He said Friday that Milton alone had caused an estimated $50 billion in damages. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week that FEMA will be able to meet 'immediate needs' caused by the two storms. But he warned in the aftermath of Helene that the agency does not have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season. But Johnson has pushed back, saying the agencies have enough money for the time being and that lawmakers will address the funding issue during the lame-duck session after the election. Also percolating in the background are tensions between Harris and Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. As Helene barreled toward Florida, the two traded accusations that the other was trying to politicize the federal storm response. Harris' office last week suggested that DeSantis was dodging her phone calls. DeSantis responded that he was unaware she had called and he grumbled that she hadn't been involved in the federal government's response before she became the Democratic nominee. Biden, for his part, said he hoped to see DeSantis on Sunday, if the governor's schedule permitted. 'He's been very cooperative,' Biden said about DeSantis. He added, 'We got on very, very well.' DeSantis said Saturday that he had no details about the president's visit. Biden was scheduled to survey damage during an aerial tour between Tampa and St. Pete Beach, where he will be briefed on the storm by federal, state and local officials. He also will residents and first responders. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday evening. At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents remain without power. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for widespread evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Helene just two weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to flee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-will-view-hurricane-milton-damage-in-florida-harris-plans-to-go-to-church-in-north-carolina-/7820683.html	2024-10-13T06:08:47-07:00	
China's Premier Li talks trade in Vietnam despite differences over South China Sea	BANGKOK — China agreed Sunday to assist Vietnam on cross-border railway development and take steps to expand agricultural imports from its smaller neighbor, Vietnam's official media said. Premier Li Qiang, on an official visit to Vietnam, pledged that China would further open its market to high-quality fruits, seafood and other Vietnamese products, a state media report said. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and second-largest export market after the U.S. Trade between the two countries reached $172 billion in 2023. Vietnam's top leader, To Lam, signaled the importance of the relationship when he made China his first overseas visit after assuming his post last year. Li came to Vietnam from neighboring Laos, where he had pushed back against calls at a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders to respect international law in territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh told Li that both sides should respect each other's legitimate rights and interests, resolve disputes through peaceful means and properly address issues related to fishers and their vessels, the state media report said. Vietnam condemned China two weeks ago for what it described as an assault by Chinese law enforcement personnel that injured several Vietnamese fishers near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The islands have been under the de facto control of China since 1974, when Beijing seized them from Vietnam in a brief but violent naval conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Southeast Asian leaders gathered in Laos last week that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. In their talks on Sunday, Chinh and Li agreed to deepen exchange and cooperation in diplomacy, national defense and public security, the state media report said. They also witnessed the exchange of 10 cooperation agreements, including the establishment of a working group to develop cross-border economic cooperation zones and the implementation of QR-code, cross-border payment services. The railway agreements covered a technical plan and feasibility studies to improve train connectivity between Vietnam and China. On trade, Chinh asked for greater access for a range of products including tropical fruits, meat products, farm-raised spiny lobster and plant-based traditional medicines. Li said that China stands ready to resolve trade issues and work with Vietnam on quarantine and customs procedures, according to the Vietnamese report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-premier-li-talks-trade-in-vietnam-despite-differences-over-south-china-sea-/7820670.html	2024-10-13T05:43:22-07:00	
NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft will scour Jupiter moon for the ingredients for life	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A NASA spacecraft is ready to set sail for Jupiter and its moon Europa, one of the best bets for finding life beyond Earth. Europa Clipper will peer beneath the moon’s icy crust where an ocean is thought to be sloshing fairly close to the surface. It won’t search for life, but rather determine whether conditions there could support it. Another mission would be needed to flush out any microorganisms lurking there. 'It’s a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable today — right now,' said program scientist Curt Niebur. Its massive solar panels make Clipper the biggest craft built by NASA to investigate another planet. It will take 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter and will sneak within 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Europa's surface — considerably closer than any other spacecraft. Liftoff is targeted for this month aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Mission cost: $5.2 billion. Europa, the superstar among Jupiter’s many moons One of Jupiter’s 95 known moons, Europa is almost the size of our own moon. It's encased in an ice sheet estimated to be 10 miles to 15 miles or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. Scientists believe this frozen crust hides an ocean that could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or more deep. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what appear to be geysers erupting from the surface. Discovered by Galileo in 1610, Europa is one of the four so-called Galilean moons of Jupiter, along with Ganymede, Io and Callisto. Seeking conditions that support life What type of life might Europa harbor? Besides water, organic compounds are needed for life as we know it, plus an energy source. In Europa’s case that could be thermal vents on the ocean floor. Deputy project scientist Bonnie Buratti imagines any life would be primitive like the bacterial life that originated in Earth’s deep ocean vents. 'We will not know from this mission because we can’t see that deep,' she said. Unlike missions to Mars where habitability is one of many questions, Clipper’s sole job is to establish whether the moon could support life in its ocean or possibly in any pockets of water in the ice. Supersized spacecraft When its solar wings and antennas are unfurled, Clipper is about the size of a basketball court — more than 100 feet (30 meters) end to end — and weighs nearly 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). The supersized solar panels are needed because of Jupiter’s distance from the sun. The main body — about the size of a camper — is packed with nine science instruments, including radar that will penetrate the ice, cameras that will map virtually the entire moon and tools to tease out the contents of Europa’s surface and tenuous atmosphere. The name hearkens to the swift sailing ships of centuries past. Circling Jupiter to fly by Europa The roundabout trip to Jupiter will span 1.8 billion miles (3 billion kilometers). For extra oomph, the spacecraft will swing past Mars early next year and then Earth in late 2026. It arrives at Jupiter in 2030 and begins science work the next year. While orbiting Jupiter, it will cross paths with Europa 49 times. The mission ends in 2034 with a planned crash into Ganymede — Jupiter’s biggest moon and the solar system's too. Europa flybys pose huge radiation risk There’s more radiation around Jupiter than anywhere else in our solar system, besides the sun. Europa passes through Jupiter’s bands of radiation as it orbits the gas giant, making it especially menacing for spacecraft. That’s why Clipper’s electronics are inside a vault with dense aluminum and zinc walls. All this radiation would nix any life on Europa’s surface. But it could break down water molecules and, perhaps, release oxygen all the way down into the ocean that could possibly fuel sea life. Earlier this year, NASA was in a panic that the spacecraft's many transistors might not withstand the intense radiation. But after months of analysis, engineers concluded the mission could proceed as planned. Other visitors to Jupiter and Europa NASA’s twin Pioneer spacecraft and then two Voyagers swept past Jupiter in the 1970s. The Voyagers provided the first detailed photos of Europa but from quite a distance. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had repeated flybys of the moon during the 1990s, passing as close as 124 miles (200 kilometers). Still in action around Jupiter, NASA’s Juno spacecraft has added to Europa’s photo album. Arriving at Jupiter a year after Clipper will be the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, launched last year. Ganymede and other possible ocean worlds Like Europa, Jupiter’s jumbo moon Ganymede is thought to host an underground ocean. But its frozen shell is much thicker — possibly 100 miles (160 kilometers) thick — making it tougher to probe the environment below. Callisto’s ice sheet may be even thicker, possibly hiding an ocean. Saturn’s moon Enceladus has geysers shooting up, but it’s much farther than Jupiter. Ditto for Saturn’s moon Titan, also suspected of having a subterranean sea. While no ocean worlds have been confirmed beyond our solar system, scientists believe they’re out there — and may even be relatively common. Messages in a cosmic bottle Like many robotic explorers before it, Clipper bears messages from Earth. Attached to the electronics vault is a triangular metal plate. On one side is a design labeled 'water words' with representations of the word for water in 104 languages. On the opposite side: a poem about the moon by U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon and a silicon chip containing the names of 2.6 million people who signed up to vicariously ride along.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-s-europa-clipper-spacecraft-will-scour-jupiter-moon-for-the-ingredients-for-life-/7820650.html	2024-10-13T04:54:52-07:00	
Sudan rescuers say air strike killed 23 in Khartoum market	Port Sudan, Sudan — A Sudanese network of volunteer rescuers said on Sunday the military carried out an air strike a day earlier on a marketplace in Khartoum, leaving 23 people dead. The market is near one of the main camps in the Sudanese capital, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been fighting the military as part of a civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people. 'Twenty-three people were confirmed dead and more than 40 others wounded' and taken to hospital after 'military air strikes on Saturday afternoon on the main market' in southern Khartoum, the youth-led Emergency Response Rooms said in a post on Facebook. Fierce fighting has raged since Friday around Khartoum, much of which is controlled by the RSF, with the military pounding the center and south of the city from the air. The military is advancing towards Khartoum from nearby Omdurman, where clashes erupted on Saturday, eyewitnesses said. World's largest displacement crisis Since April 2023, when war broke out between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the paramilitaries had largely pushed the army out of Khartoum. The World Health Organization says at least 20,000 people have been killed in the civil war, but some estimates put the toll much higher at up to 150,000. The war has also created the world's largest displacement crisis, the U.N. says. More than 10 million people, around a fifth of Sudan's population, have been forced from their homes, according to U.N. figures. A U.N.-backed assessment in August declared a famine in the Zamzam refugee camp in Darfur near the city of El-Fasher. The government loyal to the army is based in Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast, where the army has retained control. The RSF meanwhile has taken control of nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur, rampaged through the agricultural heartland of central Sudan and pushed into the army-controlled southeast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-rescuers-say-air-strike-killed-23-in-khartoum-market-/7820644.html	2024-10-13T04:36:49-07:00	
Amazon wants to be everything to everyone	Mount Juliet, United States — Amazon is bolstering its e-commerce empire while continuing a march deeper into people's lives, from robots to healthcare and entertainment. Innovations unveiled in recent days by the Seattle-based tech titan included a delivery van computer system to shave time off deliveries by its speed-obsessed logistics network. Amazon Stores boss Doug Herrington said that the technology enables vans to recognize stops and signal which packages to drop off. 'When we speed up deliveries, customers shop more,' Herrington said. 'For 2024, we're going to have the fastest Prime delivery speeds around the world,' he added, referring to Amazon's subscription service. On top of that, according to Herrington, Amazon last year managed to cut 45 cents off the cost per unit shipped, a huge savings when considering the massive volume of sales. Prime is the 'glue' Amazon last year recorded profit of more than $30 billion on revenue of $575 billion, powered by its online retail operation and its AWS cloud computing division. 'They have this whole flywheel model with Amazon Prime membership in the middle,' said eMarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian. 'That's the glue that keeps everything together.' Businesses include retail, advertising, cloud computing and streamed movies and music. But that very model has the 30-year-old company facing a US government lawsuit, accused of expanding an illegal monopoly and otherwise harming competition. Amazon makes money from data gathered about consumers, either by targeting ads or through insights into what products they might like, Davidkhanian said. That was why Amazon paid for expensive rights to stream NFL American football games on Prime Video in a move that promises to help it pinpoint fans of the sport. Amazon's digital assistant Alexa can order items on command and has been even built into appliances such as washing machines to let them automatically buy supplies like laundry soap as needed. A 'pocket pharmacy' Amazon showed off enhancements to its virtual health care service called One Medical. For $9 a month Prime members are promised anytime access to video consultations with health care professionals, along with record keeping and drug prescriptions. An Amazon Pharmacy takes advantage of the company's delivery network to get prescriptions to patients quickly, striving for speeds of less than 24 hours for 45 percent of customers by the end of next year. 'We're building a pharmacy in your pocket that offers rapid delivery right to your door,' Amazon Pharmacy chief Hannah McClellan said, referring to the option of using a smartphone app. The healthcare market promises to be lucrative for Amazon, which is 'trying to be the platform that has everything for everyone,' said analyst Davidkhanian. Real world wrinkles Amazon has suffered setbacks when it comes to brick-and-mortar stores but it continues to strive for a winning strategy. The company next year will open its first 'automated micro warehouse' in Pennsylvania, next to a Whole Foods Market organic grocery shop, the chain it bought in 2017. People will be able to pick up certain items selected online, with orders filled by robots, after shopping next door for fresh produce and groceries. Meanwhile, Amazon is ramping up use of artificial intelligence at its online store with tools helping sellers describe and illustrate products. Product labels will change according to the user, displaying terms likely to catch their attention such as 'strawberry flavor' for some and 'gluten-free' for others. 'The things that Amazon is doing with AI are to make sure that you go from researching something to making the purchase as quickly as possible,' Davidkhanian said. At the logistics center near Nashville, robotic arms deftly placed packages in carts that autonomously made their way to trucks. Logistics center automation improves safety and frees up workers for more interesting tasks, according to Amazon robotics manager Julie Mitchell. However, critics cite delivery speed pressure and other factors as making Amazon warehouses more dangerous than the industry average.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amazon-wants-to-be-everything-to-everyone-/7820636.html	2024-10-13T04:11:54-07:00	
Pope urges 'respect' for UN peacekeepers in Lebanon	Vatican City, Holy See — Pope Francis asked Sunday for 'respect' for U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon who have accused the Israeli military of deliberately firing on their positions. 'I am close to all the people involved, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, where I ask that the U.N. peacekeepers be respected,' Francis said at the Vatican. The peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, has said that its forces have repeatedly come under fire in the Lebanese town of Naqura where it is headquartered, as well as in other positions. At least five U.N. peacekeepers have been wounded as Israeli forces battle Hezbollah. Efforts to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza have so far failed. 'I once again call for an immediate ceasefire on all fronts that the paths of diplomacy and dialogue be pursued to achieve peace,' Francis said at the end of the Angelus prayer. 'I pray for all the victims, for the displaced, for the hostages and I hope that this great and unnecessary suffering, generated by hatred and revenge, will end soon,' he said. 'Brothers and sisters, war is an illusion. It will never bring peace, it will never bring security, it is a defeat for everyone, especially because you believe you are invincible. Please stop,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-urges-respect-for-un-peacekeepers-in-lebanon-/7820628.html	2024-10-13T03:53:32-07:00	
Determination to rebuild follows Florida's hurricanes with acceptance that storms will come again	VENICE, Fla — No sooner had residents of the Bahia Vista Gulf condominium complex dug out and from Hurricane Helene than they were faced with the same daunting cleanup from new damage inflicted by Hurricane Milton. The beachfront units had been gutted, treated and dried out after Hurricane Helene and mounds of sand that had blown in from the beach had been removed. Then, less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton barreled in and undid all the progress. 'They’ve got to start the whole process over, cleaning, sanitizing, bringing in drying equipment, getting them all dried and prepped for renovations,' lamented Bill O’Connell, a board member at the complex in Venice, about an hour's drive south of Tampa. The second hurricane 'brought all the sand back on our property.' Some longtime Floridians have grown accustomed to the annual cycle of storms that can shatter and upend lives in a state known mostly for its balmy weather, sunshine and beaches. 'It’s the price you pay to live in paradise,' O’Connell said. 'If you want to live here with this view, beautiful sunsets, be able to go out on your boat, enjoy what Florida has to offer, you have to be willing to accept that these storms are going to come.' The devastation of the back-to-back storms is still being tallied as a swath of the state comes to terms with damage from the unusual dual strike of storms in such close proximity. Many residents, some returning home after evacuating, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a fuel shortage gripped the state. President Joe Biden planned to visit the Gulf Coast on Sunday. Hurricane Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. Overall, more than a thousand people were rescued in the wake of the storm. Disaster hits twice In the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 southwest of Tampa, Catherine Praught said she and her husband, Mark, felt 'pure panic' when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn’t damaged by the second storm. 'This is where we live,' Catherine Praught said of their low-lying home of 36 years that had to be emptied, gutted and scrubbed after Helene. 'We’re just hopeful we get the insurance company to help us.' Residents of the community's modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages were working Saturday to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene. A similar scene could be found in Steinhatchee, west of Gainsville, where enormous piles of debris lined the streets. Melissa Harden lives less than a block from a restaurant and neighborhood bar that were reduced to rubble. Her house is on 16-foot (4.9-meter) pilings, but 4 feet (1.2 meters) of water still flooded in. When Milton was forecast, she feared Steinhatachee would be hit by the third hurricane in 14 months. 'Personally, I thought, if it comes, we’re already evacuated and our home is pretty messed up,' she said as friends and relatives helped with the cleanup, removing bathroom fixtures and pulling out damaged boards. 'Of course we didn’t want it! No more storms!' Moody’s Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70 billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15 billion. Widespread fuel shortage In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no gas Saturday, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at 7 a.m. and were still waiting four hours later. 'They told me they have gas coming but they don’t know when it’s going to be here,' he said. 'I have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas.' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more. Residents can get 10 gallons (37.8 liters) each, free of charge, he said. 'Obviously as power gets restored ... and the Port of Tampa is open, you’re going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to give people another option,' DeSantis said. Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state’s fuel stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without power. Rising rivers among the remaining safety threats As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water. Some 1.1 million Floridians were still without power Saturday night, according to Poweroutage.us. National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next several days and result in flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have a break here from all our wet weather.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/determination-to-rebuild-follows-florida-s-hurricanes-with-acceptance-that-storms-will-come-again-/7820622.html	2024-10-13T03:37:27-07:00	
Indian politician known for close ties with Bollywood is killed in Mumbai	NEW DELHI — A senior politician in India's financial capital, Mumbai, who was also known for his close ties with Bollywood has been shot dead weeks before a key state election. Baba Siddique, 66, was shot multiple times outside his son's office in Mumbai on Saturday night, police said in a statement. He later succumbed to his wounds at the city's Lilavati Hospital. Siddique was associated with the Indian National Congress party for decades but had recently joined a regional party that rules Maharashtra state. He was also close to several Bollywood superstars and was known for throwing lavish parties. Maharashtra's deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who is from the same political party as Siddique, said he was shocked by the killing. 'The incident will be thoroughly investigated, and strict action will be taken against the attackers. The mastermind behind the attack will also be traced,' Pawar said in a statement. News agency Press Trust of India reported that two suspected attackers had been arrested, and police were searching for another. Broadcaster NDTV said the two suspects claimed they were part of a crime gang that has carried out multiple killings in the past. Elections in Maharashtra state are expected to be held in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-politician-known-for-close-ties-with-bollywood-is-killed-in-mumbai/7820607.html	2024-10-13T02:38:57-07:00	
Pakistan separatist militants BLA deny involvement in attack on mines	KARACHI, Pakistan — The Baloch Liberation Army, a militant separatist group in Pakistan, denied involvement in an attack that killed at least 21 mine workers, condemning the violence. Dozens of attackers stormed a cluster of small private coal mines in Pakistan's restive southwest on Friday with guns, rockets and hand grenades, killing some miners in their sleep and shooting others after lining them up. 'Baloch Liberation Army condemns the massacre of 21 Pashtun workers in Dukki, making it clear that our organization has no involvement in this tragic incident,' the BLA said in an email late on Saturday. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack on the mines of the Junaid Coal Co. in the mineral-rich province of Balochistan that borders Afghanistan and Iran. It was the worst such attack in weeks and comes days before Pakistan hosts a summit of the Eurasian group Shanghai Cooperation Organization. A decadeslong insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region, pressing demands for a share in mineral-rich resources. Besides the separatists, the region is also home to Islamist militants, who have resurged since 2022 after revoking a cease-fire with the government. The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation's government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources. The province is home to key mining projects, including Reko Diq, run by giant Barrick Gold ABX.TO and believed to be one of the world's largest gold and copper mines. China also operates a gold and copper mine in the province. At the time of the attack, a delegation from Saudi Arabia, which says it is set to buy a stake in the Reko Diq mine, was in Islamabad exploring deals as Pakistan seeks to recover from an economic crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-separatist-militants-bla-deny-involvement-in-attack-on-mines/7820594.html	2024-10-13T01:27:52-07:00	
Israeli strike on Gaza kills family of 8, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on the central Gaza Strip has killed a family of eight, Palestinian medical officials said Sunday, as Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants and pushed for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from the territory's north. Israel is also waging an air and ground campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon and is expected to strike Iran in retaliation for a missile attack earlier this month, though it has not said how or when. The strike in Gaza late Saturday hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing parents and their six children, who ranged in age from 8 to 23, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, where the bodies were taken. It said another seven people were wounded, including two women and a child in critical condition. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies and filmed funeral prayers held at the hospital. More than a year into the war with Hamas, Israel continues to strike what it says are militant targets in Gaza nearly every day. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas and other armed groups because they operate in densely populated areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck schools being used as shelters by displaced people, accusing militants of hiding among them. Israel presses for full evacuation of northern Gaza In northern Gaza, Israeli air and ground forces have been attacking Jabaliya, where the military says militants have regrouped. Over the past year, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to the built-up refugee camp, which dates back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, and other hard-hit areas. Israel has ordered the full evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. An estimated 400,000 people remain in the north after a mass evacuation ordered in the opening weeks of the war. The Palestinians fear Israel intends to permanently depopulate the north to establish military bases or Jewish settlements there. The military confirmed Saturday that hospitals were included in the evacuation orders but said it had not set a specific timetable. It said a medical convoy scheduled to transfer patients from the Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days was canceled for security reasons — without elaborating — but that the convoy had delivered fuel to the hospital on Saturday. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel's bombardment and ground invasions of Gaza have killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and left much of the territory in ruins. Palestinian medical officials do not say whether those killed by Israeli forces are militants or civilians, but say women and children make up over half the fatalities. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. Israel expected to strike Iran as fighting rages in Lebanon Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, began firing rockets into Israel on October 8, 2023, drawing retaliatory airstrikes. The conflict dramatically escalated in September with a wave of Israeli strikes that killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and most of his senior commanders. Israel launched a ground operation into southern Lebanon earlier this month. At least 2,255 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of the conflict, including more than 1,400 people since September, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, which also does not say how many were Hezbollah fighters. At least 54 people have been killed in the rocket attacks on Israel, nearly half of them soldiers. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched around 180 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of Nasrallah, an Iranian general who was with him, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who died in an explosion in Iran's capital in July that was widely blamed on Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-on-gaza-kills-family-of-8-palestinian-officials-say/7820590.html	2024-10-13T01:15:55-07:00	
Taiwan spots Chinese carrier; China military video says 'prepared for battle'	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan reported a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing to the island's south on Sunday, as China's military put out a video saying it was 'prepared for battle' amid concerns in Taipei about the possibility of a new round of Chinese war games. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, detests its president Lai Ching-te as a 'separatist,' and the Chinese military routinely operates around the island. Last week at his keynote national day speech, Lai said the People's Republic of China had no right to represent Taiwan, but that the island was willing to work with Beijing to combat challenges such as climate change, striking both a firm and conciliatory tone, but drawing anger from China. Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement that a Chinese navy group led by the carrier the Liaoning had entered waters near the Bashi Channel, which connects the South China Sea and the Pacific and separates Taiwan from the Philippines. It said the carrier group was expected to enter the Western Pacific. Taiwan's armed forces are keeping a close watch on developments and 'exercising an appropriate vigilance and response,' the ministry added, without elaborating. Security sources in Taiwan had said before Lai's address that his speech could prompt new Chinese war games, last held by the country in May in what Beijing said was 'punishment' for Lai's inauguration speech that month. Earlier Sunday, the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command, which has responsibility for an area that includes Taiwan, put out a propaganda video on its social media accounts entitled 'fully prepared and biding ones time before battle.' It showed fighter jets and warships operating together, mobile missile launchers being moving into place and amphibious assault vehicles, with a small map of Taiwan included in one of the Chinese characters that make up the video's title. China has not ruled out using force to achieve unification. China's defense ministry did not answer calls outside of office hours on Sunday. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lai and his government reject Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing but been rebuffed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-spots-chinese-carrier-china-military-video-says-prepared-for-battle-/7820587.html	2024-10-13T00:48:58-07:00	
Ukrainian move to ban Moscow-linked church stirs anger in Russia	moscow — Speaking behind the thick white walls of Moscow's ancient Danilov Monastery, Archpriest Igor Yakimchuk is adamant: People must not be forbidden to pray in their chosen branch of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. He speaks calmly, but Yakimchuk is one of many Orthodox Christians in Russia who are angry about a law passed by Kyiv in August that targets a Russia-linked Orthodox church that long dominated religious life in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration accuses the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) of spreading pro-Russian propaganda in time of war and of housing spies, charges it denies. Under the law, the Russian Orthodox Church itself was banned on Ukrainian territory and a government commission was tasked with compiling a list of 'affiliated' organizations - expected to include the UOC - whose activities will be outlawed, too. 'In the 21st century, in the center of Europe, millions of people are being deprived of their basic civil rights,' Yakimchuk, wearing a black cassock and a large Orthodox cross around his neck, told Reuters in an interview. 'Because what does it mean to ban a church, which is the largest religious denomination in Ukraine, no matter how much the current Ukrainian authorities would like to downplay its scale? Everyone understands perfectly well that it is impossible to forbid people to pray.' Whether the UOC retains the following it once did is disputed. An independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) that was set up after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 to be fully independent of Moscow has seen its popularity grow rapidly since President Vladimir Putin sent his forces into Ukraine in 2022. Ukrainian authorities say the UOC is fair game. They have launched dozens of criminal proceedings, including treason charges, against dozens of its clergy. At least one has been sent to Russia as part of a prisoner swap. Church divided However, Yakimchuk's denunciation of what he calls 'absolute lawlessness' in Ukraine is a reflection of how the nearly 32-month war - which Moscow calls a 'special military operation' - has divided Orthodox hierarchies in the two countries, even though they all adhere to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The UOC tried to distance itself from Moscow once the war was underway, condemning Russia's actions and removing references to the 'Moscow Patriarchate' from its name. But those attempts angered clerics in Moscow, who have thrown their weight behind what they cast as Russia's 'holy war' in Ukraine against the expanding influence of what they see as a decadent, godless West. The UOC's efforts also failed to allay Kyiv's concerns about the church's activities and loyalties. The process of shutting down UOC operations in Ukraine - something one Ukrainian lawmaker called 'cleansing' - is likely to be lengthy and involve court battles, but the church's days seem numbered. Some opinion polls suggest more than 80% of Ukrainians do not trust the UOC. The Kremlin, which has forged close ties with the Russian Orthodox Church, has described Ukraine's new law as 'an open attack on freedom of religion.' One Russian Orthodox priest in St. Petersburg, Leonid Trofimuk, branded Ukraine's action as 'Satanism' and compared it to Soviet-era state repression of religion. 'The 20th century is behind us,' he said. 'We saw the persecution of the church at that time, but we didn't think that there would be this kind of persecution that is going on now in Ukraine.' Ordinary Russian churchgoers interviewed by Reuters also expressed concern. 'There is a kind of total politicization of matters of faith going on,' said Sergei, a St. Petersburg resident. 'I would like common sense to prevail and the international community to finally pay attention.' His criticism of Kyiv's moves was echoed by churchgoers leaving a golden onion-domed church more than 900 miles (1,448 km) away to the south, in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city seized by Russian forces in 2022 after a long siege. 'This is wrong - you shouldn't do this kind of thing,' said Olga, a Mariupol resident who was wearing a headscarf. 'How can he [Zelenskyy] interfere with faith in God? This is not a matter for the state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-move-to-ban-moscow-linked-church-stirs-anger-in-russia/7819838.html	2024-10-13T00:31:55-07:00	
Congo violence forces people to use often-risky boats to travel	goma, congo — The overcrowded boat that capsized in eastern Congo last week killed eight members of Serge Nzonga's family along with 70 others. Days later, he was back on the same route that claimed their lives in yet another boat lacking safety measures. Nzonga and hundreds of other passengers, including Associated Press journalists, lined up at the seaport in Goma, eastern Congo's largest city, getting ready to board a locally made boat bound for Bukavu city on the other side of Lake Kivu, a perilous journey they would rather undertake than travel Congo's treacherous roads. On Wednesday, as authorities continued to investigate the accident, families of those killed last week protested at the port of Kituku, accusing officials of negligence in failing to address the insecurity in eastern Congo and of delaying rescue operations. The capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are abandoning the few available roads for wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods. The roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. Hundreds have already been killed or declared missing in such accidents so far this year. 'This is the only way we can reach our brothers and sisters in the other province of South Kivu,' said Nzonga as his turn to board a locally made boat drew nearer. 'If we don't take this journey, there is no other route,' he said. 'The road is blocked because of the war and … the roads are not paved in eastern Congo.' In the absence of good roads in this country of more than 100 million, the rivers in Congo have been the only means of transport many here have known — especially in remote areas where passengers usually come from. Among the frequent passengers on the boats and ferries are traders unable to transport their goods along the dangerous roads, some of them spending days or weeks along the rivers. However, several others also board them for various other reasons: It is faster than traveling by road, the roads are in bad shape, and families like Nzonga's can travel at more affordable rates. That leaves boats and ferries frequently overcrowded, and safety measures are hardly implemented, analysts say. The boat that capsized on Congo's Lake Kivu last week was trying to dock just meters away from the port of Kituku when it began to sink, witnesses said. The boat was visibly overcrowded, 'full of passengers (as) it started to lose its balance,' said Francine Munyi, an eyewitness. Authorities often threaten harsh punishments to curb overloading, enforce safety measures and punish corrupt officials, but measures promised to stop the accidents are rarely carried out, analysts say. 'The private sector dominates Lake Kivu … but the boats cannot leave the port without the authorization of the lake commissioner,' said Emile Murhula, an independent analyst, adding that authorities are also supposed to enforce the use of life jackets and remove boats that do not meet the required standards. As the Bukavu-bound boat — named Emmanuel 4 — navigated the waters, the passengers cast worried glances at the lake, many of them without life jackets. Canoes crisscrossed the lake in search of the bodies of victims still missing after the latest accident. At the seaport, dozens of relatives waited patiently for answers. Nzonga, the passenger who lost eight relatives, admits it is dangerous to travel without a life jacket. But even those jackets are not provided by the government. 'We're scared, but it's the only way we have to get to the other province,' he said. 'I still have to travel, even though we're used to it (the accidents).'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-violence-forces-people-to-use-often-risky-boats-to-travel-/7818547.html	2024-10-13T00:30:06-07:00	
Cambodian fishermen turn to raising eels as Tonle Sap lake runs out of fish	KAMPONG PHLUK, Cambodia — Em Phat, 53, studies his eel tanks with the intensity of a man gambling with his livelihood. For millennia, fishermen like him have relied on the bounty of the Tonle Sap in Cambodia, Southeast Asia's largest lake and the epicenter of the world's most productive inland fishery. But climate change, dams upstream on the Mekong River that sustains the lake, and deforestation in the region have changed everything. There aren't enough fish and living by the lake has become dangerous as storms intensify due to global warming. 'Being a fisherman is hard,' he said. Phat hopes that raising eels — a delicacy in Asian markets like China, Japan and South Korea — will provide a way forward. He raises eels in different tanks: translucent eel eggs bob gently in small glass aquariums. Voracious glassy larvae swim in plastic tanks. Larger tubs have bicycle tires to provide places for juvenile eels to hide. Raising eels can be profitable but it's risky. Eels are notoriously difficult and expensive to raise. They need constant pure, oxygenated water and special food and are susceptible to diseases. Phat lost many eels when a power cut stopped his oxygen pumps, killing the fish. But he's optimistic about the future. Living on land, instead of on the lake, also means that his wife, Luy Nga, 52, can grow vegetables to eat and sell, so they are making enough money to get by. 'The eels have value and can also be exported to China and other countries in the future,' he said. That fishermen like Phat can no longer rely on the Tonle Sap, literally the 'Great Lake,' for their livelihood reflects how much has changed. The lake used to more than quadruple in size to an area larger than the country of Qatar during the rainy season, inundating native forests and creating the perfect breeding ground for diverse fish to thrive. The 'flood pulse,' a natural process of periodic flooding and droughts in the river system helped make the Mekong Basin the world's largest freshwater fishery, with nearly 20% of all freshwater fish worldwide caught there, according to the think tank Stimson Center in Washington. More than 3 million people live and fish by the lake: a third of all 17 million Cambodians rely on the fisheries sector and up to 70% of Cambodia's intake of animal protein is from fish. But dams upstream in China and Laos are cutting the Mekong's flow, weakening that flood pulse. The lakes have been depleted by overfishing and much of the forest surrounding it has been logged or burned for farmland. Cambodian authorities are reluctant to estimate the extent that fish stocks have declined. This year, the flood pulse was delayed by about two months, according to the Mekong Dam Monitor, a research project. In this shattered ecosystem, raising eels or other fish can provide fishermen like Phat with a 'buffer,' said Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada who has worked in the region for decades. 'Aquaculture, such as eel farming, is a way for people to take more control over their income source and livelihood,' he said, adding that it also allows them to raise fish that they know will fetch higher prices. Phat is one of more than thousands helped by a program run by the Britain-based nonprofit VSO to boost incomes of people living by Tonle Sap. VSO provides his baby eels and has taught him how to raise them. Eels are in high demand in Cambodia and elsewhere, said Sum Vy, 38, a coordinator at VSO, so they're profitable. When fishermen know how to farm eels and hatch the babies, others can follow. 'Not only can he or she earn the money to support their family, they can share this knowledge and skill with other people,' he said. Expanding aquaculture is helping increase Cambodian exports. Its fish production increased 24-fold in the two decades leading up to 2021 and, unlike its neighbors, most of its fish catch is inland, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization or FAO. Much of it is consumed domestically and exports have grown sluggishly. Earlier this year, the government launched a scheme to improve fish processing technologies and address food safety concerns, hoping to begin exporting more fish to Europe next year. Cambodia has signed trade agreements with China and began shipping frozen eels to Shanghai last year. 'This export will contribute to economic growth, creating jobs for our farmers and fishermen,' Heng Mengty, the export manager of the Cambodian fish exporter told China's official Xinhua news agency. The promised growth can't come soon enough for Cambodians living in fishing communities around the lake. Some families live in homes that float year round, others on homes built on stilts up to 8 meters high, to keep them above floodwaters during the rainy season. Fishing is the only form of subsistence for many, but signs of decay are evident. Fishing nets catch only very small fish, or worse, nothing at all. Families speak of giant fish that are now rarely seen. The catch is a fraction of what it used to be. Even 10 years ago, Som Lay, a 29-year-old fisherman said, the lake was teeming with fish. But illegal fishing has increased and some families have already given up fishing and are trying to find land where they can grow rice. 'The entire village — my family and others — is facing these difficulties,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-fishermen-turn-to-raising-eels-as-tonle-sap-lake-runs-out-of-fish/7817185.html	2024-10-13T00:29:30-07:00	
Hot days and methamphetamine are now a deadlier mix in US	PHOENIX — On just one sweltering day during the hottest June on record in Phoenix, a 38-year-old man collapsed under a freeway bridge and a 41-year-old woman was found slumped outside a business. Both had used methamphetamine before dying from an increasingly dangerous mix of soaring temperatures and stimulants. Meth is showing up more often as a factor in the deaths of people who died from heat-related causes in the U.S., according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Death certificates show about one in five heat-related deaths in recent years involved methamphetamine. In Arizona, Texas, Nevada and California, officials found the drug in nearly a third of heat deaths in 2023. Meth is more common in heat-related deaths than the deadly opioid fentanyl. As a stimulant, it increases body temperature, impairs the brain's ability to regulate body heat and makes it harder for the heart to compensate for extreme heat. If hot weather has already raised someone's body temperature, consuming alcohol or opioids can exacerbate the physical effects, 'but meth would be the one that you would be most concerned about,' said Bob Anderson, chief of statistical analysis at the National Center for Health Statistics. The trend has emerged as a synthetic drug manufactured south of the border by Mexican drug cartels has largely replaced the domestic version of meth fictionalized in the TV series Breaking Bad. Typically smoked in a glass pipe, a single dose can cost as little as a few dollars. At the same time, human-caused climate change has made it much easier to die from heat-related causes in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas and California's southeastern desert. This has been Earth's hottest summer on record. Phoenix baked in temperatures topping 37.7 Celsius for 113 straight days and hit 47.2 Celsius in late September — uncharacteristic even for a city synonymous with heat. The searing temperatures have carried into October. 'Putting on a jacket can increase body temperature in a cold room. If it's hot outside, we can take off the jacket,' explained Rae Matsumoto, dean of the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy at the University of Hawaii in Hilo. But people using the stimulant in the outdoor heat 'can't take off the meth jacket.' These fatalities are particularly prevalent in the Southwest, where meth overdoses overall have risen since the mid-2000s. In Maricopa County, America's hottest major metropolitan area, substances including street drugs, alcohol and certain prescription medicines for psychiatric conditions and blood pressure control were involved in about two-thirds, or 419 of the 645 heat-related deaths documented last year. Meth was detected in about three-quarters of these drug cases and was often the primary cause of death, public health data show. Fentanyl was found in just under half of them. In Pima County, home to Tucson, Arizona's second most populous city, methamphetamine was a factor in one-quarter of the 84 heat-related deaths reported so far this year, the medical examiner's office said. In metro Las Vegas, heat was a factor in 294 deaths investigated last year by the Clark County coroner's office, and 39% involved illicit and prescription drugs and alcohol. Of those, meth was detected in three-fourths. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration notes in its 2024 National Drug Threat Assessment that 31% of all drug-related deaths in the U.S. are now caused by stimulants that speed up the nervous system, primarily meth. More than 17,000 people in the U.S. died from fatal overdoses and poisonings related to stimulants in the first half of 2023, according to preliminary CDC data. Although overdoses have been more associated with opiates like fentanyl, medical professionals say overdosing on meth is possible if a large amount is ingested. Higher blood pressure and a quickened heart rate can then provoke a heart attack or stroke. 'All of your normal physiological ways of coping with heat are compromised with the use of methamphetamines,' said Dr. Aneesh Narang, an emergency medicine physician at Banner University Medical Center in downtown Phoenix. Narang, who sits on a board that reviews overdose fatalities, said the 'vast majority' of the heat stroke patients seen in his hospital's emergency department this summer had used street drugs, most commonly methamphetamine. Because of its proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, Phoenix is considered a 'source city' where large amounts of newly smuggled meth are stored and packaged into relatively tiny doses for distribution, said Det. Matt Shay, a narcotics investigator with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. 'It's an amazing amount that comes in constantly every day,' Shay said. 'It's also very cheap.' U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized about 74,000 kilograms of meth at the U.S.-Mexico border this last fiscal year ending September 30, up from the 63,500 kilograms captured in the previous 12 months. And sellers often target homeless people, Shay said. 'It's a customer base that is easy to find and exploit,' Shay said. 'If you're an enterprising young drug dealer, all you need is some type of transportation and you just cruise around and they swarm your car.' Jason Elliott, a 51-year-old unemployed machinist, said he's heard of several heat-related deaths involving meth during his three years on the streets in Phoenix. 'It's pretty typical,' said Elliot, noting that stimulants enable people to stay awake and alert to prevent being robbed in shelters or outdoors. 'What else can you do? You have stuff; you go to sleep, you wake up and your stuff is gone.' Dr. Nick Staab, assistant medical director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said brochures were printed this summer and distributed in cooling centers to spread the word about the risk of using stimulants and certain prescription medicines in extreme heat. But it's unclear how many are being reached. People who use drugs may not be welcomed at some cooling centers. A better solution, according to Stacey Cope, capacity building and education director for the harm reduction nonprofit Sonoran Prevention Works, is to lower barriers to entry so that people most at risk 'are not expected to be absent from drugs, or they're not expected to leave during the hottest part of the day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hot-days-and-methamphetamine-are-now-a-deadlier-mix-in-us/7817104.html	2024-10-13T00:27:48-07:00	
Online hate against South Asian Americans rises steadily, report says	WASHINGTON — Online hate against Americans of South Asian ancestry has risen steadily in 2023 and 2024 with the rise of politicians from that community to prominence, according to a report released Wednesday by nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate. Why it's important Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is of Indian descent, as are former Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, is also Indian American. Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. elections. There has been a steady rise in anti-Asian hate in extremist online spaces from January 2023 to August 2024, the report said. The nonprofit group blamed the rise on a 'toxic political climate in which a growing number of leaders and far-right extremist voices continue to spew bigoted political rhetoric and disinformation.' Key quotes 'Online threats of violence towards Asian communities reached their highest levels in August 2024, after Usha Vance appeared at the Republican National Convention and Kamala Harris was declared a presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention,' Stop AAPI Hate said. 'The growing prevalence of anti-South Asian online hate ... in 2023 and 2024 tracks with the rise in South Asian political representation this election cycle,' it added. By the numbers Among Asian American subgroups, South Asian communities were targeted with the highest volume of anti-Asian online hostility, with 60% of slurs directed at them in that period, according to the report. Anti-South Asian slurs in extremist online spaces doubled last year, from about 23,000 to more than 46,000, and peaked in August 2024. There are nearly 5.4 million people of South Asian descent living in the United States, comprising of individuals with ancestry from nations including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.	https://www.voanews.com/a/online-hate-against-south-asian-americans-rises-steadily-report-says/7817086.html	2024-10-13T00:27:16-07:00	
Cubans searching for a better future leave pets behind	HAVANA — Balto, Pepa and Mami were among the lucky ones. After being abandoned by their owners who left Cuba — or simply couldn't care for them anymore — the dogs were rescued by animal rights activists on the island, who fed them, sterilized them and found them a new home. Many others didn't have such luck and were left wandering the streets. While there are no official figures or estimates of how many pets have been left behind by their owners who leave the island, the number of abandoned cats and dogs has spiked in the last two years as Cubans migrate in record numbers, animal activists say. 'We'd receive a phone call from someone asking us to care for their pets, because they're suddenly migrating and don't know what to do with them,' said Elizabeth Meade, founder of Adoptions for Love, an animal shelter in Havana. Although the shelter found a home for some 300 rescued pets in the past year, many of those were returned — or simply went missing — after their new owners also decided to migrate. For these animals, said Meade, 'it's not always a happy ending.' Between October 2021 and September 2024, U.S. authorities reported more than 600,000 encounters with Cubans — a significant number for an island of roughly 10 million people. That is in addition to the thousands who choose to migrate to Spain or other Latin American countries. For many Cubans, taking their pets with them is not an option. Transporting an animal from Havana to Miami through a specialized agency can cost up to $1,200 — including medical examinations and the flight — and, since September, pet owners have to pay an additional $1,300 to comply with a legal obligation of a quarantine. For those who remain in Cuba, daily life is not easy: the country's gross domestic product fell by 2% in 2023, resulting in rampant inflation and food and fuel shortages. Caring for a pet on the island can be prohibitive for most Cubans. While the average monthly salary in the state sector — the largest employer — is about $21, a 20-kilo bag of imported dog food can cost up to $70 and a visit to the vet costs the equivalent of $10. The increase in the number of abandoned pets in Cuba has been largely countered by animal activism, a phenomenon that began to take shape in 2018 after the Internet was massively adopted and social media helped coordinate actions. In 2021, animal rights activists scored a win when the government passed a long-awaited animal welfare law, which seeks to prevent cruelty and raise awareness about the need to protect animals. The law also penalizes animal cruelty, including dogfights, and the sacrifice of animals for religious purposes but activists say it is not enough. 'Abandonment is the worst form of animal abuse,' said Leandro Valdés, a dog trainer and proud owner of Koffee, a rescued dog that has gone viral as he rides around Havana in the back of Valdés' motorcycle, wearing goggles and a seatbelt. 'The increase in migration has resulted in more pets being abandoned,' says Valdés, noting the 'loss of values' that resulted from Cuba's deepening economic crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cubans-searching-for-a-better-future-leave-pets-behind/7820566.html	2024-10-12T21:59:51-07:00	
Volunteers bring solar power to Hurricane Helene's disaster zone	BAKERSVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene downed power lines and washed out roads all over North Carolina's mountains, the constant din of a gas-powered generator is getting to be too much for Bobby Renfro. It's difficult to hear the nurses, neighbors and volunteers flowing through the community resource hub he has set up in a former church for his neighbors in Tipton Hill, a crossroads in the Pisgah National Forest north of Asheville. Much worse is the cost: he spent $1,200 to buy it and thousands more on fuel that volunteers drive in from Tennessee. Turning off their only power source isn't an option. This generator runs a refrigerator holding insulin for neighbors with diabetes and powers the oxygen machines and nebulizers some of them need to breathe. The retired railroad worker worries that outsiders don't understand how desperate they are, marooned without power on hilltops and down in 'hollers.' 'We have no resources for nothing,' Renfro said. 'It's going to be a long ordeal.' More than 43,000 of the 1.5 million customers who lost power in western North Carolina still lacked electricity on Friday, according to Poweroutage.us. Without it, they can't keep medicines cold or power medical equipment or pump well water. They can't recharge their phones or apply for federal disaster aid. Crews from all over the country and even Canada are helping Duke Energy and local electric cooperatives with repairs, but it's slow going in the dense mountain forests, where some roads and bridges are completely washed away. 'The crews aren't doing what they typically do, which is a repair effort. They're rebuilding from the ground up,' said Kristie Aldridge, vice president of communications at North Carolina Electric Cooperatives. Residents who can get their hands on gas and diesel-powered generators are depending on them, but that is not easy. Fuel is expensive and can be a long drive away. Generator fumes pollute and can be deadly. Small home generators are designed to run for hours or days, not weeks and months. Now, more help is arriving. Renfro received a new power source this week, one that will be cleaner, quieter and free to operate. Volunteers with the nonprofit Footprint Project and a local solar installation company delivered a solar generator with six 245-watt solar panels, a 24-volt battery and an AC power inverter. The panels now rest on a grassy hill outside the community building. Renfro hopes his community can draw some comfort and security, 'seeing and knowing that they have a little electricity.' The Footprint Project is scaling up its response to this disaster with sustainable mobile infrastructure. It has deployed dozens of larger solar microgrids, solar generators and machines that can pull water from the air to 33 sites so far, along with dozens of smaller portable batteries. With donations from solar equipment and installation companies as well as equipment purchased through donated funds, the nonprofit is sourcing hundreds more small batteries and dozens of other larger systems and even industrial-scale solar generators known as 'Dragon Wings.' Will Heegaard and Jamie Swezey are the husband-and-wife team behind Project Footprint. Heegaard founded it in 2018 in New Orleans with a mission of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of emergency responses. Helene's destruction is so catastrophic, however, that Swezey said this work is more about supplementing generators than replacing them. 'I've never seen anything like this,' Swezey said as she stared at a whiteboard with scribbled lists of requests, volunteers and equipment. 'It's all hands on deck with whatever you can use to power whatever you need to power.' Down near the interstate in Mars Hill, a warehouse owner let Swezey and Heegaard set up operations and sleep inside. They rise each morning triaging emails and texts from all over the region. Requests for equipment range from individuals needing to power a home oxygen machine to makeshift clinics and community hubs distributing supplies. Local volunteers help. Hayden Wilson and Henry Kovacs, glassblowers from Asheville, arrived in a pickup truck and trailer to make deliveries this week. Two installers from the Asheville-based solar company Sundance Power Systems followed in a van. It took them more than an hour on winding roads to reach Bakersville, where the community hub Julie Wiggins runs in her driveway supports about 30 nearby families. It took many of her neighbors days to reach her, cutting their way out through fallen trees. Some were so desperate they stuck their insulin in the creek to keep it cold. Panels and a battery from Footprint Project now power her small fridge, a water pump and a Starlink communications system she set up. 'This is a game changer,' Wiggins said. The volunteers then drove to Renfro's hub in Tipton Hill before their last stop at a Bakersville church that has been running two generators. Other places are much harder to reach. Heegaard and Swezey even tried to figure out how many portable batteries a mule could carry up a mountain and have arranged for some to be lowered by helicopters. They know the stakes are high after Heegaard volunteered in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria's death toll rose to 3,000 as some mountain communities went without power for 11 months. Duke Energy crews also restored infrastructure in Puerto Rico and are using tactics learned there, like using helicopters to drop in new electric poles, utility spokesman Bill Norton said. The hardest customers to help could be people whose homes and businesses are too damaged to connect, and they are why the Footprint Project will stay in the area for as long as they are needed, Swezey said. 'We know there are people who will need help long after the power comes back,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/volunteers-bring-solar-power-to-hurricane-helene-s-disaster-zone/7820560.html	2024-10-12T21:28:45-07:00	
Widespread fuel shortage hampers Florida’s Hurricane Milton cleanup	CORTEZ, Florida — Floridians recovering from Hurricane Milton, many of whom were journeying home after fleeing hundreds of miles to escape the storm, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a fuel shortage gripped the state. In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no gas, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at the station at 7 a.m. and were still waiting four hours later. 'They told me they have gas coming but they don't know when it's going to be here,' he said. 'I have no choice. I have to sit here all day with her until I get gas.' Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more. Residents can get 37.85 liters each, free of charge, he said. 'Obviously as power gets restored ... and the Port of Tampa is open, you're going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to give people another option,' DeSantis said. Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state's fuel stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without power. Disaster hits twice Those who reached home were assessing the damage and beginning the arduous cleaning process. Some, like Bill O'Connell, a board member at Bahia Vista Gulf in Venice, had thought they were done after the condo association hired companies to gut, treat and dry the units following Hurricane Helene. Milton undid that work and caused additional damage, O'Connell said. 'It reflooded everything that was already flooded, brought all the sand back on our property that we removed,' O'Connell said. 'And also did some catastrophic wind damage, ripped off many roofs and blew out a lot of windows that caused more damage inside the units.' The two hurricanes left a ruinous mess in the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 along the northern edge of Sarasota Bay. Residents of its modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages were working to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene. 'Everything is shot,' said Mark Praught, a retired street sweeper for Manatee County, who saw 1.2-meter storm surges during Helene. 'We'll replace the electrical and the plumbing and go from there.' Praught and his wife, Catherine, have lived for 36 years in a low-lying home that now looks like an empty shell. All the furniture had to be discarded, the walls and the brick and tile floors had to be scrubbed clean of muck, and drywall had to be ripped out. Catherine Praught said they felt 'pure panic' when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn't damaged by the second storm. 'This is where we live,' Catherine Praught said. 'We're just hopeful we get the insurance company to help us.' In Bradenton Beach, Jen Hilliard scooped up wet sand mixed with rocks and tree roots and dumped the mixture into a wheelbarrow. 'This was all grass,' Hilliard said of the sandy mess beneath her feet. 'They're going to have to make 500 trips of this.' Hilliard, who moved to Florida six months ago and lives further inland, said she was happy to pitch in and help clean up her friend's home a block from the shore in Bradenton Beach. Furniture and household appliances sat outside alongside debris from interior drywall that was removed after Helene sent several feet of storm surge into the house. Inside, walls were gutted up to 1.2 meters, exposing the beams underneath. 'You roll with the punches,' she said. 'Community is the best part, though. Everybody helping each other.' Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. Overall, more than a thousand people had been rescued in the wake of the storm as of Saturday, DeSantis said. Property damage and economic costs in the billions On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida's Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect with DeSantis during the visit. The trip offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve more funding during their preelection recess. It's something Johnson says he won't do. Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which stretches through November in the Atlantic. DeSantis welcomed the federal government's approval of a disaster declaration announced Saturday and said he had gotten strong support from Biden. 'He basically said, you know, you guys are doing a great job. We're here for you,' he said when asked about his conversations with Biden. 'We sent a big request and we got approved for what we wanted.' Moody's Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70 billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15 billion. Safety threats remain, including rising rivers As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water. Some 1.3 million Floridians were still without power by Saturday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next four or five days resulting in river flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have a break here from all our wet weather.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/widespread-fuel-shortage-hampers-florida-s-hurricane-milton-cleanup/7820558.html	2024-10-12T21:02:20-07:00	
In Hiroshima, Nobel Prize brings survivors hope, sense of duty	HIROSHIMA, Japan — Almost eight decades after an atomic bomb devastated her hometown of Hiroshima, Teruko Yahata carries the scar on her forehead from when she was knocked over by the force of the blast. The U.S. bombs that laid waste to Hiroshima on the morning of August 6, 1945, and to Nagasaki three days later, changed the course of history and left Yahata and other survivors with deep scars and a sense of responsibility toward disarmament. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday to the Nihon Hidankyo group of atomic bomb survivors, for its work warning of the dangers of nuclear arms, has given survivors hope and highlighted their work still ahead, Yahata and others said. 'It felt as if a light suddenly shone through. I felt like I could see the light,' the 87-year-old said on Saturday, describing her reaction to hearing about the award. 'This feels like the first step, the beginning of a movement toward nuclear abolition,' she told Reuters at the site of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. She was just 8 years old and in the back garden of her home when the bomb hit. Although her house was 2.5 kilometers from the hypocenter, the blast was strong enough to throw her several meters back into her house, she said. Seventy-nine years later, and a day after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the survivors the prize, a long line formed outside the museum, with dozens of foreign and Japanese visitors queuing up to get in. A bridge leading into the memorial park was decorated with a yellow sheet and other handmade signs against nuclear weapons. Campaigners gathered signatures for nuclear abolition from those passing by. Nihon Hidankyo, formed in 1956, has provided thousands of witness accounts, issued resolutions and public appeals, sent delegations to the U.N. and peace conferences, and collected signatures advocating nuclear disarmament. Yahata, who is not a Nihon Hidankyo member, said it was that drive to gather signatures that finally paid off after bearing little fruit for most of a century. 'It's this amount of sadness and joy that led them to this peace prize. I think it's something very meaningful,' she said. Nihon Hidankyo's co-chair, Toshiyuki Mimaki, said he felt the award meant more responsibility, adding that most atomic bomb survivors were more than 85 years old. 'Rather than feeling purely happy, I feel like I have more responsibility now,' he told Reuters, sitting in a Hidankyo office in Hiroshima in front of a map showing the impact of the bomb on the city. In rural areas the group is on the verge of falling apart, the 82-year-old said. 'The big challenge now is what to do going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-hiroshima-nobel-prize-brings-survivors-hope-sense-of-duty/7820557.html	2024-10-12T20:37:15-07:00	
Beijing loyalists will vote to endorse former top judge as Macao's next leader	MACAO — About 400 Beijing loyalists were set to vote Sunday to endorse the sole candidate for the top job in the Chinese city of Macao in a largely ceremonial election that would make him the first leader of the casino hub to be born in mainland China. Former top judge Sam Hou Fai ’s expected victory within hours would be a departure from the long-standing custom of having chief executives who were born in the former Portuguese colony, typically from influential business families. The shift in the city’s leadership to someone from the legal profession will create expectations of a declining influence from business circles, which critics have often accused of colluding with officials, analysts say. They anticipate Beijing’s policy agenda for the city will take priority. Sam, 62, is widely seen to have Beijing’s blessings. He has already secured endorsements from 386 of the 400 election committee members who are to vote on Sunday. Most of the territory’s 687,000 residents lack voting rights, leading to mixed sentiments about the election. Some hope Sam will heed public opinion and avoid prioritizing business interests, while others feel disconnected from an election process they can’t participate in. Still, political observers said many residents are comfortable with Sam’s non-local origin in a city that has been home to migrants for decades. With Sam’s victory guaranteed, the real challenges await in the governance hurdles that lie ahead. Macao is the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Beijing has called for the city to diversify its gambling-reliant economy. Sam has promised to accelerate the current government’s plan to boost tourism and other sectors such as traditional Chinese medicine, finance, exhibitions and commerce. However, the city will still need to rely on the gambling industry for government revenues to support the city's welfare and accomplish other goals laid out by Beijing, analysts say. China wants Macao to develop into a world-class tourism and leisure center and play a bigger role as a bridge for trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Small local businesses have been hurt by residents who spend money in the neighboring mainland city of Zhuhai, which offers a wider selection of items with good value for money. Chinese tourists are also now spending less than before. It remains to be seen whether Sam, with a lack of government leadership experience, can form a capable cabinet to tackle these pressing issues. Sam was born in neighboring Guangdong province in 1962. He graduated from the prestigious law school of Peking University in Beijing. He also studied the Portuguese language, culture and law at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and once practiced law in mainland China. When Macao returned to Chinese rule in 1999, Sam was appointed the city’s top judge, a role in which he served for nearly 25 years before resigning in August to participate in the election. He handled some politically sensitive cases, including rejecting an appeal of a police ban on a vigil commemorating China’s bloody 1989 military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His court also upheld a decision to bar pro-democracy figures from running in the 2021 legislative elections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-loyalists-will-vote-to-endorse-former-top-judge-as-macao-s-next-leader/7820551.html	2024-10-12T19:28:41-07:00	
US official accuses Russia, China of blocking Asia leaders' statement	washington — Russia and China blocked a proposed consensus statement for the East Asia Summit drafted by Southeast Asian countries, mainly over objections to language on the contested South China Sea, a U.S. official told Reuters on Saturday. A draft statement arrived at by consensus by the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations was put to the 18-nation East Asia Summit meeting in Laos on Thursday evening, the official said. 'ASEAN presented this final draft and said that, essentially, this was a take-it-or-leave-it draft,' the official said on condition of anonymity. The United States, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India all said they could support it, the official said, adding: 'The Russians and the Chinese said that they could not and would not proceed with a statement.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference in Vientiane on Friday the final declaration had not been adopted because of 'persistent attempts by the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to turn it into a purely political statement.' China's Washington embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. official said there were a couple of issues of contention, but the key one was how it referred to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), going further than in the previous 2023 EAS statement. However, the official said, 'there was certainly no language that was getting into the nitty gritty of any particular standoff, no language that was favoring any claimant over any other.' China claims nearly all of the South China Sea and has stepped up pressure on rival claimants, including several ASEAN countries, notably the Philippines. ASEAN has spent years negotiating a Code of Conduct with Beijing for the strategic waterway, with some ASEAN states insisting it be based on UNCLOS. China says it backs a code but does not recognize a 2016 arbitral ruling that said its claim to most of the South China Sea had no basis under UNCLOS, to which Beijing is a signatory. According to a draft seen by Reuters, the proposed EAS statement contained an extra sub-clause over the 2023 approved statement, and this was not agreed to. It noted a 2023 U.N. resolution saying that UNCLOS 'sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.' Another sub-clause not agreed said the international environment, including 'in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar, Ukraine and the Middle East ... present challenges for the region.' Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the summit Beijing was committed to UNCLOS and striving for an early conclusion of a Code of Conduct, while stressing its claims have solid historical and legal grounds. 'Relevant countries outside the region should respect and support the joint efforts of China and regional countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, and truly play a constructive role for peace and stability in the region,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-official-accuses-russia-china-of-blocking-asia-leaders-statement/7820549.html	2024-10-12T18:14:48-07:00

Afghan man imprisoned in France, accused of planning 'violent action'	paris — A 22-year-old Afghan was indicted and imprisoned in France on Saturday, accused of supporting the ideology of the Islamic State (IS) and of having 'fomented' a 'plan for violent action' in a football stadium or a shopping center. His arrest, which took place Tuesday in Haute-Garonne, has 'links' with the arrest of an Afghan living in the United States and charged Wednesday with planning an attack on the day of the U.S. elections, the national anti-terrorist prosecutor's office (PNAT) said, confirming a source close to the case questioned by AFP. This 27-year-old Afghan, living in the southern U.S. state of Oklahoma, was in contact on the Telegram messaging service with a person identified by the FBI as an IS recruiter, according to American judicial authorities. According to the source close to the case, during their investigations, the American authorities transmitted information to the French authorities, triggering the opening of an investigation in Paris and leading to three arrests. On Tuesday morning in the southwest of France, three men, aged 20 to 31, two of whom are brothers, were arrested in Toulouse and Fronton by investigators from the General Directorate of Internal Security (DGSI), supported by the RAID, the police intervention unit, as part of a preliminary investigation opened on September 27 for 'terrorist criminal association with a view to preparing one or more crimes against persons.' 'The investigations carried out have highlighted the existence of a plan for violent action targeting people in a football stadium or a shopping center fomented by one of them, aged 22, of Afghan nationality and holder of a resident card, several elements of which also establish radicalization and adherence to the ideology of the Islamic State,' the PNAT told AFP on Saturday. His lawyer, Emanuel de Dinechin, did not wish to comment at this stage. In accordance with the PNAT requisitions, he was charged with terrorist criminal association by an investigating judge, then placed in provisional detention. According to a source close to the case, this young man comes from the Tajik community in Afghanistan and his project, which he reportedly spoke about on Telegram, remained rather vague and unfinished. According to another source close to the investigation, he has been living in France for around three years. The other two men were released after their police custody. Reconfiguration The last arrests for a plan for violent action in France date back to the end of July. Two young men, aged 18 and originally from Gironde in the southwest, were indicted on July 27, suspected of having created a group on social networks 'intended to recruit' people 'motivated (to) perpetrate a violent action' during the Paris Olympic Games. Three attacks were foiled during the Olympic period, according to the authorities. In addition to the two young people from Gironde, one of the plans targeted establishments, including bars, around the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-Etienne (southeast), and the other came from a group that had planned attacks against institutions and representatives of Israel in Paris. Five people have been charged, including a minor teenager, in these cases. The 'jihadist threat represents 80% of the procedures' initiated by the PNAT, anti-terrorism prosecutor Olivier Christen recalled in mid-September. 'In the first half of 2024, there were approximately three times more procedures' of this type than in the same period in 2023, he added. According to him, this increase is explained by the 'geopolitical context,' but also by 'the reconfiguration, particularly in Afghanistan' of the Islamic State group. In September, two attacks by the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) group, the regional branch of IS in Afghanistan, killed around 20 people in that country. The deadliest attack by ISIS left 145 dead in March at a concert hall in Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-man-indicted-imprisoned-in-france-for-planning-violent-action-/7820335.html	2024-10-12T17:25:01-07:00

Lithuanians elect new parliament amid cost of living, security worries	VILNIUS, Lithuania — Lithuanians elect a new parliament Sunday in a vote dominated by concerns over the cost of living and potential threats from neighboring Russia, with the opposition Social Democrats tipped to emerge as the largest party but well short of a majority. The outgoing center-right coalition of Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte has seen its popularity eroded by high inflation that topped 20% two years ago, by deteriorating public services and a widening gap between rich and poor. Polling stations open at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and close at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT). Results are expected after midnight local time. Opinion polls suggest Simonyte's Homeland Union will win just 9%, behind the Social Democrats at 18% and the anti-establishment Nemunas Dawn at 12%, though the eventual shape of a future coalition will depend on how smaller parties perform. The Baltic state of 2.9 million people has a hybrid voting system in which half of the parliament is elected by popular vote, with a 5% threshold needed to win seats. The other half is chosen on a district basis, a process which favors the larger parties. If no candidate gets over 50% of the vote in a district, its top two candidates face each other in a run-off on October 27. Domestic issues have loomed large in the election campaign, with the Social Democrats vowing to tackle increased inequality by raising taxes on wealthier Lithuanians to help fund more spending on healthcare and social spending. But national security is also a major concern in Lithuania, which is part of the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union and shares a border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad as well as with Belarus, a close Moscow ally. Three quarters of Lithuanians believe that Russia could attack their country in the near future, a Baltijos Tyrimai/ELTA poll found in May. The main parties strongly support Ukraine in its war with invading Russian forces and back increased defense spending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lithuanians-elect-new-parliament-amid-cost-of-living-security-worries/7820530.html	2024-10-12T17:01:14-07:00	
Protesters rally against proposed nuclear plant near forest reserve, tourist hub in Kenya	KILIFI, Kenya — Dozens rallied against a proposal to build Kenya's first nuclear power plant in one of the country's top coastal tourist hubs which also houses a forest on the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage site. Kilifi County is renowned for its pristine sandy beaches where hotels and beach bars line the 165-mile-long coast and visitors boat and snorkel around coral reefs or bird watch in Arabuko Sokoke Forest Reserve, a significant natural habitat for the conservation of rare and endangered species, according to the United Nations organization. The project, proposed last year, is set to be built in the town of Kilifi — about 522 kilometers (324 miles) southeast of the capital, Nairobi. Many residents have openly opposed the proposal, worried about what they say are the negative effects of the project on people and the environment, leading to a string of protesters which at times turned violent. Muslim for Human Rights (MUHURI) led the march Friday in Kilifi to the county governor's office where they handed him a petition opposing the construction of the plant. Some chanted anti-nuclear slogans while others carried placards with 'Sitaki nuclear,' Swahili for 'I don't want nuclear.' The construction of the 1,000MW nuclear plant is set to begin in 2027 and be operational by 2034, with a cost of 500 billion Kenyan shillings ($3.8 billion). Francis Auma, a MUHURI activist, told the Associated Press that the negative effects of the nuclear plant outweigh its benefits. 'We say that this project has a lot of negative effects; there will be malformed children born out of this place, fish will die, and our forest Arabuko Sokoke, known to harbor the birds from abroad, will be lost,' Auma said during Friday's protests. Juma Sulubu, a resident who was beaten by the police during a previous demonstration, attended Friday's march and said: 'Even if you kill us, just kill us, but we do not want a nuclear power plant in our Uyombo community.' Timothy Nyawa, a fisherman, participated in the rally out of fear that a nuclear power plant would kill fish and, in turn, his source of income. 'If they set up a nuclear plant here, the fish breeding sites will all be destroyed.' Phyllis Omido, the executive director at the Center for Justice Governance and Environmental Action, who also attended the march, said Kenya's eastern coastal towns depended on eco-tourism as the main source of income and a nuclear plant would threaten their livelihoods. 'We host the only East African coastal forest, we host the Watamu marine park, we host the largest mangrove plantation in Kenya. We do not want nuclear (energy) to mess up our ecosystem,' she said. Her center filed a petition in Nov. 2023 in parliament calling for an inquiry and claiming that locals had limited information on the proposed plant and the criteria for selecting preferred sites. It also raised concerns over the risks to health, the environment and tourism in the event of a nuclear spill, saying the country was undertaking a 'high-risk venture' without proper legal and disaster response measures in place. The petition also expressed unease over security and the handling of radioactive waste in a country prone to floods and drought. The Senate suspended the inquiry until a lawsuit two lawyers filed in July seeking to stop the plant's construction, claiming public participation meetings were rushed and urging the Nuclear Power and Energy Agency (Nupea) not to start the project, was heard. Nupea said construction would not begin for years and environmental laws were under consideration, adding that adequate public participation was carried out. The nuclear agency also published an impact assessment report last year that recommended policies be put in place to ensure environmental protections, including detailed plans for the handling of radioactive waste, measures to mitigate environmental harm, such as setting up a nuclear unit in the national environment management authority, and emergency response teams.	https://www.voanews.com/a/planned-nuclear-plant-in-kenyan-tourist-hub-endangered-species-home-sparks-protest-/7820332.html	2024-10-12T16:19:45-07:00	
Chinese premier visits Vietnam, agrees to boost economic ties	hanoi, vietnam — Vietnam and China agreed on Saturday to boost defense and security cooperation despite their years-long maritime dispute in the South China Sea, said the Vietnamese government. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and a vital source of imports for its manufacturing sector. The two countries on Saturday also agreed to boost economic ties, with China pledging to further open its market for Vietnamese farm produce while Vietnam would facilitate Chinese investment, the government added in a statement. It said the two countries will prioritize cooperation in developing railway links. The statement came after Chinese premier Li Qiang met Vietnamese President To Lam in Hanoi late on Saturday, as Li began his three-day state visit to Vietnam. Sources told Reuters on Friday that China and Vietnam are expected to sign new agreements — including pacts to boost railway links and agricultural trade — during the visit. Li is expected to meet Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and attend a business forum in Hanoi on Sunday. Early this month, Vietnam protested to China over what it said was an attack on a Vietnamese fishing boat in contested South China Sea waters that injured several fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-premier-visits-vietnam-agrees-to-boost-economic-ties-/7820330.html	2024-10-12T15:57:33-07:00	
Pregnant Philippine women arrested in Cambodia for surrogacy could be prosecuted	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Thirteen pregnant Philippine women accused of illegally acting as surrogate mothers in Cambodia after being recruited online could face prison terms after giving birth, a senior Interior Ministry official said Saturday. Interior Ministry Secretary of State Chou Bun Eng, who leads the country's fight against human trafficking and sexual exploitation, said police found 24 foreign women, 20 Philippine and four Vietnamese, when they raided a villa in Kandal province, near the capital of Phnom Penh, on September 23. Thirteen of the Philippine women were found to be pregnant and were charged in court on October 1 under a provision in the law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, she said. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children. Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower than in countries such as the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000. The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal. In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services. The new case is unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere. Cambodia already has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries. Details of the new surrogacy case remain murky, and officials have not made clear whether the women were arrested or whether anyone involved in organizing the scheme has been identified. Chou Bun Eng told The Associated Press that the business that recruited the surrogates was based in Thailand, and their food and accommodation in Cambodia were arranged from there. She said the authorities had not yet identified the business. She said the seven Philippine women and four Vietnamese women who were caught in the raid but who were not pregnant would be deported soon. The 13 pregnant women have been placed under care at a hospital in Phnom Penh, said Chou Bun Eng. She added that after they give birth, they could be prosecuted on charges that could land them in prison for two to five years. She said that Cambodia considered the women not to have been victimized but rather offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money. Her assertion could not be verified, as the women could not be contacted, and it is not known if they have lawyers. The Philippine Embassy in Cambodia, in response to a local news account of the affair, issued a statement Wednesday confirming most of the details related to what it called the 'rescue of 20 Filipino women.' 'The Philippine Embassy ensured that all 20 Filipinos were interviewed in the presence of an Embassy representative and an interpreter in every step of the investigation process,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pregnant-philippine-women-arrested-in-cambodia-for-surrogacy-could-be-prosecuted-/7820323.html	2024-10-12T15:40:54-07:00	
US aviation authority approves SpaceX Starship 5 flight for Sunday	washington — The Federal Aviation Administration approved a license Saturday for the launch of SpaceX's Starship 5 on Sunday after earlier saying it did not expect to make a decision until late November. Reuters first reported this week the faster than expected timetable after the FAA in September had suggested a much longer review. SpaceX is targeting Sunday for the launch and said a 30-minute launch window opens at 7 a.m. CT (1200 GMT) The FAA said Saturday that SpaceX had 'met all safety, environmental and other licensing requirements for the suborbital test flight' for the fifth test of the Starship and has also approved the Starship 6 mission profile. The Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket are fully reusable systems designed to carry crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon and beyond. The fifth test flight of the Starship/Super Heavy from Boca Chica, Texas, includes a return to the launch site of the Super Heavy booster rocket for a catch attempt by the launch tower, and a water landing of the Starship vehicle in the Indian Ocean west of Australia. The FAA said if SpaceX chooses an uncontrolled entry 'it must communicate that decision to the FAA prior to launch, the loss of the Starship vehicle will be considered a planned event, and a mishap investigation will not be required.' On Friday, the FAA approved the return to flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle after it reviewed and accepted the SpaceX-led investigation findings and corrective actions for the mishap that occurred September 28. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has harshly criticized the FAA, including for proposing a $633,000 fine against SpaceX over launch issues and for the delay in approving the license for Starship 5, which the company said has been ready to launch since August. Musk has called for the resignation of FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and threatened to sue the agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-aviation-authority-approves-spacex-starship-5-flight-for-sunday-/7820318.html	2024-10-12T14:37:16-07:00	
Taiwan's China Airlines denies facing pressure about aircraft order	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan's China Airlines is not facing any political pressure on its decision about whether to buy Boeing or Airbus aircraft for a refreshment of its long-haul fleet, the company's chairman said Saturday. Taiwan's largest carrier has been weighing Boeing's 777X and the Airbus A350-1000 as replacements for its fleet of 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, mostly used on U.S. and some high-density regional routes, according to industry sources. China Airlines Chairman Hsieh Shih-chien told reporters the company was still in the process of evaluating which aircraft to purchase and, asked if there was any political pressure on the decision, replied 'no.' 'When it comes to buying aircraft, it is only China Airlines ourselves who makes the assessment. I want to clarify this,' Hsieh said. Multibillion-dollar deals for new aircraft often must take political as well as business considerations into account — especially in the case of Taiwan, given its international situation and the pressure it faces to give in to China's sovereignty claims, which are rejected by the democratically elected government in Taipei. The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, and China Airlines' majority owner is the Taiwan government. A senior industry source told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, that on the China Airlines deal the timing was a complicating factor given November's U.S. election. In 2022, shortly after then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei — which set off Chinese war games — China Airlines announced a $4.6 billion order for Boeing's 787 to replace its aging fleet of Airbus A330s. China Airlines already operates 15 of the smaller Airbus A350-900s, as well as nine of the freighter versions of the 777. Hsieh said the 787s would start arriving from next year, while a further 11 Airbus A321s, which are replacing its older Boeing 737-800s, would all come before 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-china-airlines-says-no-political-pressure-on-new-aircraft-order-/7820306.html	2024-10-12T13:56:56-07:00

Holding Super Bowl outside US is possible, says NFL's commissioner	london — The National Football League's aggressive international growth plan could include holding a Super Bowl outside the United States for the first time, Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Saturday. Goodell has shot down the idea in the past, but he told a fan forum in London that it's a possibility. 'We've always traditionally tried to play a Super Bowl in an NFL city — that was always sort of a reward for the cities that have NFL franchises,' he said in response to a question about moving the neutral-site game internationally. 'But things change. It wouldn't surprise me at all if that happens one day.' Goodell floated the idea as he outlined a plan that could include playing 16 international games every year if the regular season expands to 18 games. He added that he has 'no doubt' that Ireland will host a game soon. He named Rio de Janeiro as a likely new host and said the Jacksonville Jaguars are considering increasing the number of games they play in London during their stadium renovations at home. This season's Super Bowl — the 59th edition — will be played in New Orleans. In 2026, Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will host, followed by SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in 2027. Kansas City's 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco in the last Super Bowl was the most-watched program in U.S. television history. Team owners already have authorized up to eight international games, but Goodell said they could double that number — creating a scenario where all 32 teams could play an international game each year. The key is expanding the regular season by one game and reducing the number of preseason games to two. 'If we do expand our season — our regular season — to an 18-and-two structure, I see us going to 16 of those games being in international markets,' Goodell said. He added that the plan could include a second bye week in the schedule. 'A lot of that depends on — can we continue to make the game safer, can we continue to modify the way we conduct the offseason as well as the training camp and as well as the season, so that these guys feel comfortable being able to play that period of time,' Goodell said. Under that scenario, he said, the season would start around Labor Day and conclude around Presidents Day — the third Monday of February. Moving to an 18th game is seen as inevitable. The players union has indicated it is open to an agreement before the current labor deal expires after the 2030 season. There are five international games this season, and Goodell said the league wants to increase to eight 'quickly.' Dublin has been seen as the next likely host — after Madrid gets its first game in 2025. 'I have no doubt that we're going to be playing in Ireland. I don't know if it will be next year, but it's coming soon,' Goodell said at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He cited Rio de Janeiro as the possible host of the next Brazil game — Sao Paulo staged one this season. London, which could get a night game at some point, has hosted regular-season games since 2007 and Germany since 2022. 'We're looking at other markets in the other direction, toward Asia,' he said. 'There's probably more interest than we can handle.' Kickoff update Goodell expects some offseason tweaks to the new kickoff rules but on the whole said 'it's working.' The new rules have made kickoffs relevant again, he said, and the early data on injuries is promising. Just over 30% of kickoffs have been returned this season compared with 20% last season, he said. 'With that increase in returns, it's giving us more data to determine whether we can do it more safely. It actually is incredibly promising. We're seeing lower impacts that have led to less severe injuries and less number of injuries. So, I think it's working,' Goodell said. On average, kickoffs drives are starting just past the 29-yard line, compared with just past the 24 previously, he said. 'I think what we'll see ultimately is a change in the offseason,' Goodell said. 'Once we know it's a safer play, it will encourage more kickoffs. That could happen in a couple of ways. You could move the kickoff line back, so that they can't kick it out as easily. You could also say the penalty for kicking it out is going to go to the 35 instead of where we're at, the 30.' He said the 'great thing' about the new system is 'one little crease develops and that guy is gone. That's what I'm looking for is that long kickoff return to return to the game. I think we had four or five last year. We're already at that number at Week 6. That's pretty good.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/holding-super-bowl-outside-us-is-possible-says-nfl-s-commissioner-/7820235.html	2024-10-12T11:26:24-07:00	
Floridians evacuated for Hurricane Milton make their way back home	BRANDON, FLORIDA — Florida residents who fled hundreds of miles to escape Hurricane Milton made slow trips home on crowded highways, weary from their long journeys and the cleanup work awaiting them but also grateful to be coming back alive. 'I love my house, but I’m not dying in it,' Fred Neuman said Friday while walking his dog outside a rest stop off Interstate 75 north of Tampa. Neuman and his wife live in Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall Wednesday night as a powerful Category 3 hurricane. Heeding local evacuation orders ahead of the storm, they drove nearly 800 kilometers to Destin on the Florida Panhandle. Neighbors told the couple the hurricane destroyed their carport and inflicted other damage, but Neuman shrugged, saying their insurance should cover it. Nearby, Lee and Pamela Essenburm made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at a picnic table as cars pulling off the slow-moving interstate waited for parking spaces outside the crowded rest stop. Their home in Palmetto, on the south end of Tampa Bay, had a tree fall in the backyard. They evacuated, fearing the damage would be more severe and worrying Milton might hit as a catastrophic Category 4 or 5 storm. 'I wasn't going to take a chance on it,' Lee Essenbaum said. 'It’s not worth it.' Milton killed at least 10 people when it tore across central Florida, flooding barrier islands, ripping the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays′ baseball stadium and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene just two weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to flee. 'Helene likely provided a stark reminder of how vulnerable certain areas are to storms, particularly coastal regions,' said Craig Fugate, who served as the Federal Emergency Management Agency's administrator under President Barack Obama. 'When people see firsthand what can happen, especially in neighboring areas, it can drive behavior change in future storms.' In the seaside town of Punta Gorda, Mayor Lynne Matthews said rescuers had to save three people from floodwaters after Milton passed, compared with 121 rescues from Helene's flooding. 'So, people listened to the evacuation order,' Matthews told a news conference Friday, noting that local authorities ensured residents heard them. 'We had teams out with the megaphones going through all of our mobile home communities and other places to let people know that they needed to evacuate.' As of Saturday morning, the number of Floridians still without power had dropped to less than 1.6 million, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday. Traffic crawled along stretches of I-75 as evacuees’ vehicles crowded alongside a steady stream of utility trucks heading south toward Tampa. While the densely populated city and surrounding Hillsborough County accounted for nearly one-fourth of the remaining power outages, Milton spared Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted on Florida’s Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect with Governor Ron DeSantis during the visit. The trip to Florida offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve further funding during their pre-election recess. It’s something the top House lawmaker says he won’t do. Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get through hurricane season, which stretches through the end of November in the Atlantic. The president said Friday that Hurricane Milton caused $50 billion in estimated damages. As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious, citing ongoing safety threats, including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects. 'We’re now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,' DeSantis said Friday. 'You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.' National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will 'keep rising' for the next four or five days resulting in river flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included earlier hurricanes. 'You can't do much but wait,' Close said of the rivers cresting. 'At least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So, we have a break here from all our wet weather.' In coastal Pinellas County, the sheriff's office used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floridians-evacuated-for-hurricane-milton-make-their-way-back-home/7820242.html	2024-10-12T11:13:21-07:00	
North Kosovo ethnic tensions at risk for violence, NATO official says	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Persistent ethnic tension in north Kosovo could trigger a repeat of violence seen in the area last year when four people died in a gun battle and NATO peacekeepers were hurt in clashes, a senior official from the military alliance warned Saturday. Kosovo is predominantly ethnic Albanian, but about 50,000 Serbs in the north reject Pristina's government and see Belgrade as their capital. A former Serbian province, Kosovo declared independence in 2008, a decade after a guerrilla uprising. U.S. Navy Admiral Stuart B. Munsch, commander of the Allied Joint Force Command Naples — which oversees NATO's peacekeeping force in Kosovo — said the alliance remained concerned about the risk of repeated violence in the volatile north. 'Heated political rhetoric could inspire some nongovernment forces to commit violence such as what happened last year,' Munsch told reporters in Pristina. 'I would not say that definitely conflict is coming; I think there is a persistent risk,' he said, referring to a lack of progress in EU-mediated talks between Kosovo's government and Serbia. A police officer and three gunmen were killed in September 2023 when a group of heavily armed attackers entered from Serbia and attacked police in the village of Banjska. Four months earlier, more than 90 soldiers were injured when Serb protesters attacked NATO peacekeepers. Kosovo has accused Serbia of being behind the Banjska attack, but Belgrade has denied the accusations. The U.S. and the European Union, Kosovo's leading global allies, have criticized the Pristina government for taking unilateral actions in the north that could spark ethnic violence and risk the lives of some 4,000 NATO troops on duty there. Kosovo rejects such criticism, and the issue has strained Pristina's ties with its Western supporters. As part of the EU-mediated dialogue, Kosovo and Serbia have been holding talks for more than a decade to normalize their relations, but there has been little progress. Like the Serbs living in north Kosovo, Belgrade also considers Kosovo to be part of Serbia and refuses to recognize it as an independent state.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-kosovo-ethnic-tensions-at-risk-for-violence-nato-official-says/7820230.html	2024-10-12T10:59:30-07:00	
Powerful storm knocks out power to 1.6 million in Brazil's largest city	SAO PAULO — More than 1.6 million people in Sao Paulo were without power on Saturday more than 16 hours after a brief but powerful storm swept through South America's largest city. Officials in Sao Paulo state said that record wind gusts Friday night of up to 108 kilometers per hour knocked down transmission lines and uprooted trees, causing severe damage in some parts. The storm also shut down several airports and interrupted water service in several areas, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Authorities originally expected to restore power within a few hours. But several neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, which is home to 21 million people, were still in the dark on Saturday and authorities were urging residents to limit their consumption of water. One person died when a tree fell on an outdoor stall, authorities said. At least four other people in surrounding Sao Paulo state also died.	https://www.voanews.com/a/powerful-storm-knocks-out-power-to-1-6-million-in-brazil-s-largest-city/7820227.html	2024-10-12T10:48:45-07:00	
Iran sends satellites to Russia for rocket launch, Tasnim reports	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran has sent two locally made satellites to Russia to be put into orbit by a Russian space vehicle, the semi-official news agency Tasnim reported Saturday, in the latest space cooperation between the two U.S.-sanctioned countries. The development of Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a small communications satellite, is the first substantial effort by Iran's private space sector, the report said. Russia sent Iranian satellites into orbit in February and in 2022, when U.S. officials voiced concern over space cooperation between Russia and Iran, fearing the satellite will not only help Russia in Ukraine but also help Iran monitor potential military targets in Israel and the wider Middle East. Kowsar could be used in agriculture, natural resource management, environmental monitoring and disaster management, Tasnim said. Hodhod is designed for satellite-based communications and could be used in remote areas with little access to terrestrial networks. In September, Iran carried out its second satellite launch this year using a rocket built by its Revolutionary Guards. The launch came as the United States and European countries accuse Tehran of transferring ballistic missiles to Russia that could be used in its war with Ukraine. Iran has denied this.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-sends-satellites-to-russia-for-rocket-launch-tasnim-reports/7820222.html	2024-10-12T10:41:28-07:00	
North Korean leader's sister threatens South over drone flights	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday accused South Korea of deliberately avoiding responsibility for the alleged flights of South Korean drones over the North’s capital and warned of a 'terrible calamity' if they continue. The statement by Kim Yo Jong came a day after North Korea’s Foreign Ministry claimed that South Korean drones carrying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets were detected in the night skies over Pyongyang on Wednesday and Thursday, as well as on October 3. The ministry said North Korean forces will prepare 'all means of attack' capable of destroying the southern side of the border and the South Korean military — and respond without warning if South Korean drones are detected in its territory again. South Korea’s defense minister initially denied the accusation, but the South’s military later adjusted its response, saying it couldn’t confirm whether the North’s claims were true. In comments published through state media, Kim, one of her brother’s top foreign policy officials, said that the South Korean military’s vague statements should be taken as proof that it was 'either the main culprit or accomplice in this incident.' 'If the military stood by while its own citizens employed drones, a widely recognized multi-purpose military tool, to violate another country’s sovereignty, thereby increasing the risk of armed conflict with a potential adversary, this would amount to intentional acquiescence and collusion,' she said. 'The moment a South Korean drone is discovered once again in skies above our capital, a terrible calamity will surely occur. I personally hope that does not happen,' she said. South Korea’s military and government didn’t immediately respond to Kim’s comments. Tensions between the Koreas are now at their worst in years as the pace of both North Korea’s missile tests and the South’s combined military training with the United States have intensified in tit-for-tat. The animosity has been exacerbated by Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns between the Koreas in recent months. Since May, North Korea has sent thousands of balloons carrying paper waste, plastic and other trash to drop on the South, in what it described as retaliation against South Korean civilian activists who flew balloons with anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea’s military responded to the North’s balloon campaign by using border loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda and K-pop to North Korea. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of the authoritarian government of leader Kim Jong Un and his family’s dynastic rule. South Korean officials have been raising concern that North Korea may seek to dial up pressure on Seoul and Washington ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. Experts say Kim's long-term goal is to eventually force Washington to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and to negotiate security and economic concessions from a position of strength. In written answers to questions by The Associated Press this month, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea is likely preparing major provocations around the U.S. election, possibly including a test detonation of a nuclear device or flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, as it tries to grab Washington’s attention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-leader-s-sister-threatens-south-over-drone-flights/7820218.html	2024-10-12T10:32:06-07:00	
Explosion, fire at service station in Russia's Chechnya kills 4	MOSCOW — An explosion at a gas station in Russia’s southern region of Chechnya killed at least four people, officials said Saturday. The explosion of a gas tank triggered a fire at the service station in the regional capital, Grozny, said Russia’s Emergencies Ministry, adding that two children were among the dead. The fire was extinguished. Grozny is about 1,500 kilometers south of Moscow. Regional authorities said a criminal investigation was opened. Last month an explosion at a gas station in the neighboring region of Dagestan killed at least 13 people and injured 23 others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-fire-at-service-station-in-russia-s-chechnya-kills-4/7820213.html	2024-10-12T10:20:05-07:00	
Norway introduces temporary border checks after terror threat level raised	OSLO, NORWAY — Norway is introducing temporary border checks on its frontiers with other Western European nations after the domestic security agency raised the terror threat level, police said Saturday. The checks will apply until October 22, according to a police statement. It cited 'a challenging threat picture' and the October 8 announcement by the security agency PST that it was increasing Norway's threat level from 'moderate' to 'high,' the second-highest level on a five-tier scale. PST pointed to an increased threat to Jewish and Israeli targets in particular. Norway isn't a member of the European Union, but the country is part of the European ID-check free-travel zone known as the Schengen area. It has land borders with EU and Schengen members Sweden and Finland. The border-free Schengen area guarantees free movement to more than 425 million EU citizens, along with non-EU nationals living in the EU or visiting the EU as tourists, as exchange students or for business purposes. That free movement of people is said to enable EU citizens to travel, work and live in an EU country without special formalities. The Schengen area encompasses most EU countries, with the exceptions of Cyprus and Ireland. Bulgaria and Romania are the newest countries to join the Schengen area, as of March 2024, meaning any person crossing the internal air and sea borders will no longer be subject to checks. Norway police said that the new temporary controls won't involve all travelers being checked, and that there's no reason to expect delays at border crossings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-introduces-temporary-border-checks-after-terror-threat-level-raised/7820173.html	2024-10-12T09:25:50-07:00	
Election stress disorder is a real thing ahead of November voting	The American Psychiatric Association says that as elections approach, stress levels go up, regardless of political affiliation.

Poland to suspend asylum rights amid pressure on Belarusian border	WARSAW, POLAND — Poland's leader said Saturday that he plans to temporarily suspend the right to asylum as part of a new migration policy, pointing to its alleged abuse by eastern neighbors Belarus and Russia. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that 'the state must regain 100% of the control over who enters and leaves Poland,' and that a territorial suspension of the right to asylum will be part of a strategy that will be presented to a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Polish news agency PAP reported. He didn't give details but said at a convention of his Civic Coalition that 'we will reduce illegal migration in Poland to a minimum.' Poland has struggled with migration pressures on its border with Belarus since 2021. Successive Polish governments have accused Belarus and Russia of luring migrants from the Middle East and Africa there to destabilize the West. Tusk pointed to alleged misuse of the right to asylum 'by [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko, by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, by smugglers, human smugglers, human traffickers. How this right to asylum is used is in exact contradiction to the idea of the right to asylum.' He said that he would demand recognition of the decision on the right to asylum from the European Union, PAP reported. Tusk's comments came after Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said Thursday that Poland will tighten its visa regulations, stepping up the vetting of applicants. That decision follows an investigation into a cash-for-visas scandal under the country's previous government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-to-suspend-asylum-rights-amid-pressure-on-belarusian-border/7820130.html	2024-10-12T08:31:01-07:00	
Harris' doctor reports she's in 'excellent health'	WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in 'excellent health' and 'possesses the physical and mental resiliency' required to serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that summarizes her medical history and status. Dr. Joshua Simmons, a U.S. Army colonel and physician to the vice president, wrote that Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle and that her most recent physical, in April, was 'unremarkable.' She 'possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,' he wrote in a two-page letter. Harris' campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with Republican Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about his health over the years, and raise questions about his fitness to serve, according to a campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Trump has released very little health information, including after his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in July. Simmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3½ years, said the vice president has a history of allergies and urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen immunotherapy for the past three years. Simmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were 'unremarkable.' Also in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms. As Harris' office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump's health and mental acuity and his failure to provide information about health status and medical history. Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's health when the 81-year-old president was seeking reelection. Since Biden was replaced on the ticket with Harris, Trump's own health has drawn more attention. Last November, Trump marked Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in 'excellent' physical and mental health. The letter, posted on Trump’s social media platform, contained no details to support its claims — measures such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-doctor-reports-she-s-in-excellent-health-/7820112.html	2024-10-12T07:50:18-07:00	
US airstrikes target multiple militant camps in Syria	BEIRUT — A series of U.S. airstrikes targeted several camps run by the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the U.S. military said will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and beyond. The U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted Friday, without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 U.S. troops have been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS militants. Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria. The U.S. military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the Islamic State group to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, as well as civilians throughout the region and beyond. It said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no civilian casualties. Last month, Iraq’s military said that Iraqi forces and American troops killed a senior IS commander who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants. At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-airstrikes-target-multiple-militant-camps-in-syria/7820096.html	2024-10-12T07:36:51-07:00	
Cameroon urges awareness of breast cancer's early stages	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Humanitarian groups in Cameroon are visiting homes and villages in remote areas this week to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month, advising women to go to hospitals for free screening and treatment. About 60% of the more than 7,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer in Cameroon this year have died because they were late in getting to hospitals, officials say. Breast cancer deaths are highly unreported because families abandon women to die at home. Thirty-year-old history student Emilie Nadege Atangana told a group of women and girls at the University of Yaounde 1 campus how she was psychologically and emotionally traumatized after receiving a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2020. Most of her relatives, friends and fellow students said she would not live long and abandoned her, she said. Atangana said she found hope when medical staff members of the Yaounde Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital told her that 90% of early-stage breast cancers are curable. Cameroonian government officials and humanitarian groups say cancer survivors such as Atangana have been sent to towns and villages as part of activities marking 'Pink Month.' The World Health Organization designates October as Pink Month, a time to teach people about cancer, including early identification and signs and symptoms. Forty-two-year-old Mesode Ngwese Agbaw, a cancer survivor, said people should stop hiding cancer patients at home to die because of the false belief that cancer cannot be treated. 'You don't need to hide alone with your pain,' she said. 'Share it with somebody, and the people will be ready to help you. I was operated on and after the operation, I have been following treatment and till now, I am fine.' This year's theme for the month in Cameroon is 'No one Should Face Breast Cancer Alone and Yes, No One is Expected to Fight Breast Cancer Alone.' Ruth Amin, a public health specialist and project manager at the Yaounde-based Lifafa Research Foundation, said that sending people suspected of having breast cancer to hospitals would prevent many of the deaths caused because the women were abandoned or got to a hospital too late. 'We are calling on the men to support their spouses, to support their mothers, to support their sisters in raising awareness, in carrying them to the hospitals to be clinically examined by professionals,' she said. 'Women should speak up,' she said. 'Women should go toward the health facilities to get examined because the earlier they are being diagnosed, the easier it would be for them to be treated.' Amin spoke to VOA via a messaging app from Buea, a southern commercial city where humanitarian caravans were educating residents about breast cancer on Saturday. Cameroon says it has equipped all hospitals with qualified medical staff members and equipment to diagnose breast cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that Cameroon has about 20,000 new cancer cases, including breast cancers, each year, with 65% related deaths.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-urges-awareness-of-breast-cancer-s-early-stages/7820056.html	2024-10-12T06:36:50-07:00	
Ukraine, Russia each say they foiled dozens of drone attacks	Kyiv, Ukraine — Russia said on Saturday it had downed 47 Ukrainian drones while Kyiv reported neutralized 24 drones fired by Moscow. The Ukrainian air force said many missiles were fired from the Russian border region of Belgorod, without specifying the number or the type. It said Russia had fired 28 drones at Ukraine, of which 24 were destroyed in the Sumy, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Mikolayev and Kherson regions. The Ukrainian chief of staff also said Kyiv's forces had struck a fuel depot overnight in the eastern Russian-occupied Lugansk region, setting it on fire. It did not give any details. Moscow did not confirm the attack. But the Russian defense ministry said its forces had downed 47 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 17 in the southeastern Krasnodar region, 16 over the Azov Sea and 12 over the border region of Lursk. The Krasnodar governor said on Telegram that Ukrainian drone attacks had damaged three homes and set a vehicle on fire. Russian forces have made advances across the eastern front line and targeted Ukraine's power grid as the country faces its toughest winter since the full-scale Russian invasion started in February 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-russia-each-say-they-foiled-dozens-of-drone-attacks/7819948.html	2024-10-12T02:15:38-07:00	
Avian enthusiasts try to counter the deadly risk of Chicago high-rises for migrating birds	chicago — With a neon-green net in hand, Annette Prince briskly walks a downtown Chicago plaza at dawn, looking left and right as she goes. It's not long before she spots a tiny yellow bird sitting on the concrete. It doesn't fly away, and she quickly nets the bird, gently places it inside a paper bag and labels the bag with the date, time and place. 'This is a Nashville warbler,' said Prince, director of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, noting that the bird must have flown into a glass window pane of an adjacent building. 'He must only weigh about two pennies. He's squinting his eyes because his head hurts.' For rescue groups like the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, this scene plays out hundreds of times each spring and fall after migrating birds fly into homes, small buildings and sometimes Chicago's skyscrapers and other hulking buildings. A stark sign of the risks came last fall, when 1,000 migrating birds died on a single night after flying into the glass exterior of the city's lakefront convention center, McCormick Place. This fall, the facility unveiled new bird-safe window film on one of its glass buildings along the Lake Michigan shore. The $1.2 million project installed tiny dots on the exterior of the Lakeside Center building, adorning enough glass to cover two football fields. Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the nearby Field Museum, hopes the project will be a success. He estimated that just 20 birds have died after flying into the convention's center's glass exterior so far this fall, a hopeful sign. 'We don't have a lot of data since this just started this fall, but at this point, it looks like it's made a huge difference,' Stotz said. But for the birds that collide with Chicago buildings, there is a network of people waiting to help. They also are aiming to educate officials and find solutions to improve building design, lighting and other factors in the massive number of bird collision deaths in Chicago and worldwide. Prince said she and other volunteers walk the streets downtown to document what they can of the birds that are killed and injured. 'We have the combination of the millions of birds that pass through this area because it's a major migratory path through the United States, on top of the amount of artificial lighting that we put out at night, which is when these birds are traveling and getting confused and attracted to the amount of glass,' Prince said. Dead birds are often saved for scientific use, including by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. Rescued birds are taken to local wildlife rehabilitation centers to recover, such as the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center in suburban Illinois. On a recent morning, veterinarian Darcy Stephenson at DuPage gave a yellow-bellied sapsucker anesthetic gas before taping its wings open for an X-ray. The bird arrived with a note from a rescue group: 'Window collision.' Examining the results, she found the bird had a broken ulna — a bone in the wing. The center takes in about 10,000 species of animals annually and 65% of them are avian. Many are victims of window collisions and during peak migration in the fall, several hundred birds can show up in one day. 'The large chunk of these birds do actually survive and make it back into the wild once we're able to treat them,' said Sarah Reich, head veterinarian at DuPage. 'Fractures heal very, very quickly in these guys for shoulder fractures. Soft tissue trauma generally heals pretty well. The challenging cases are going to be the ones where the trauma isn't as apparent.' Injured birds go through a process of flight testing, then get a full physical exam by the veterinary staff and are rehabilitated before being set free. 'It's exciting to be able to get these guys back out into the wild, especially some of those cases that we're kind of cautiously optimistic about or maybe have an injury that we've never treated successfully before,' Reich said, adding that these are the cases 'clinic staff get really, really excited about.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/avian-enthusiasts-try-to-counter-the-deadly-risk-of-chicago-high-rises-for-migrating-birds/7819848.html	2024-10-12T00:47:44-07:00	
Ukraine's vast forests devastated in hellscape of war	Sviati Hory National Nature Park, Ukraine — Serhiy Tsapok surveyed the smoldering ruins of pine trees, blackened stumps as far as the eye could see. 'They're dead now,' the weary ranger said of the trees he'd nursed for almost two decades. The 41-year-old's daily route through the Ukrainian forests, once a joy, has become a nightmare. The fire he fought, caused by a blast of undetermined cause, wiped out three hectares of 80-year-old pine trees at the Sviati Hory National Nature Park in eastern Ukraine, according to officials there. Four-fifths of the park's nearly 12,000 hectares have been damaged or destroyed by fires or ordnance, they said. It's a tiny portion of the damage caused by the war, which has brutalized the landscape of Ukraine and much of its 10 million hectares of forests. Both Russian and Ukrainian armies blast thousands of shells at each other every day, shredding the earth in grinding combat that echoes the trench warfare of World War I. Reuters spoke to nearly 20 specialists in the field, including forest rangers, ecologists, demining experts and government officials, who provided a detailed picture of the ruin wrought on Ukraine's forests by the 31-month-old war. Russian authorities didn't respond to requests for comment for this article. 'Enormous' loss The director of the Sviati Hory park, Serhiy Pryimachuk, told Reuters that Russian munitions had burned vast tracts of the area, once a rare and beloved beauty spot in a heavily industrialized region. 'What we have lost is enormous,' he said. Tending to forests is now a perilous occupation, with mines and unexploded shells hidden in the ground posing the biggest threat. Ranger Oleksandr Polovynko, 39, nearly lost a foot after stepping on a mine while tending the forest last year. 'I crawled back to the car and drove home with one leg,' he recalled. It took him six months to return to work. All that remains of many forests in eastern Ukraine are fields of stripped, broken trunks. Local wildlife, including deer, boars and woodpeckers, have been badly affected by the loss of habitats, the experts said. In northern Ukraine's Chernobyl nature reserve, the pre-war population of over 100 Przewalski's horses - a globally endangered species of wild horse - has been hit hard by the conflict, according to Oleh Lystopad, an ecologist with the ANTS advocacy group who said landmines were making it difficult to extinguish fires. 'Right now, it's in question to what extent this species can continue to exist there,' Lystopad said. Bleak legacy The damage to forests is part of a broader trail of environmental destruction caused by the war, which could leave a bleak natural legacy for decades to come, having poisoned the soil and rivers, polluted the air and left vast tracts of the country riddled with mines, according to the experts. The dense pine forests common to eastern Ukraine catch alight easily and have been decimated by the conflict, said Brian Milakovsky, a U.S.-based forester who until recently lived and worked in Ukraine for eight years. The war has torn through the habitats of some unique flora such as the chalk pine, a rare subspecies of Scots pine, according to ecologists and park officials. Milakovsky said the environmental crisis was particularly acute in Russian-held areas - nearly a fifth of Ukraine - where occupation authorities appeared to have little capacity to extinguish forest fires. He estimated about 80% of the pine forests in the eastern region of Luhansk had been destroyed. About 425,000 hectares of forest across the country have been contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance, according to the environment ministry. Authorities say they still need to inspect up to 3 million hectares of forest that are or have been occupied by Russian forces and are likely riddled with mines and ordnance. The foresters interviewed said the Russians were heavily dug in and left booby traps and tripwires behind as they retreated. 'If we want to extinguish a fire quickly, it's impossible because the entire territory is mined,' Ruslan Strilets, who was Ukraine's environment minister when he was interviewed in July. 'There is a risk of being killed or maimed.' Indeed, on top of serious injuries to rangers like Polovynko, 14 forest workers have been killed by landmines, booby traps or shelling during the conflict, according to environment ministry data. Decades of work, billions of dollars The specialists interviewed said repairing the damage to the forests would take decades and cost billions of dollars. Some doubted whether some heavily mined areas of forest would ever be cleared, citing past examples of forests declared no-go zones after previous European wars. The official estimate is that demining all contaminated territory, including forests and other areas such as agricultural land, will take 70 years, Strilets, who has since been replaced as environment minister, told Reuters in Kyiv on July 22. Four ecologists with expertise in Ukrainian forests said the subsequent process of regenerating damaged areas would be complex and could take decades, plus billions of dollars of investment. According to a June 2024 study on the Ukraine war's carbon emissions, conflict-related forest fires directly emitted greenhouse gases equivalent to 6.75 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of the annual emissions of Armenia. Ukraine has also lost the carbon capture potential of those burned trees. The World Bank estimated in February that the damage wrought by the war on forests and other protected natural areas, including marshes and wetlands, exceeded $30 billion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-vast-forests-devastated-in-hellscape-of-war-/7818546.html	2024-10-12T00:46:49-07:00	
Argentina's triple-digit inflation slows, but workers still struggle to pay bills	BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's triple-digit inflation, among the world's highest, is starting to slow down but this offers little relief for workers whose salaries have stayed the same while costs of basic goods skyrocketed and the government slashed state subsidies. 'We're losing track of what's expensive and what's cheap,' said university professor Daniel Vazquez while shopping in Buenos Aires. 'Prices keep going up and the only thing that isn't going up is salaries.' 'The gap is very, very big,' he said. While annualized inflation in September remained well into the triple digits at 209%, month-on-month price hikes slowed to their lowest level since late 2021 at 3.5%, data from the national statistics agency showed on Thursday. The data landed in line with the forecasts of analysts, who predict that inflation will end 2024 at 124%. Libertarian President Javier Milei has cut subsidies to sectors such as energy and transportation, while vowing to trim what he calls bloat in the public sector, shuttering some offices and trimming jobs. 'You've never seen inflation being fought like this before. It takes a little longer but it's genuine,' Milei wrote on X after the inflation data was published Thursday. The tough austerity drive has prolonged a recession and caused poverty rates to surge to around 53%. Computer programmer Ivan Cortesi, 30, said that while food prices remained similar to last month, utility costs rose significantly. 'This past month there has been a significant increase in all utilities,' he said. According to the statistics agency, rents as well as water, power and gas prices led monthly inflation, up over 7%, followed by clothing and shoes which rose 6% and education costs that increased over 4%. Food prices increased just 2% from last month but more than tripled their level from a year ago, while housing and utility costs nearly quadrupled. Cigarettes, alcohol, health care, transport and communications also tracked annual inflation well above 200%. Milei devalued the local currency when he took office in December, and the sharp spending cuts have particularly hit informal workers, civil servants, pensioners, doctors and teachers. On Wednesday, Argentina's Congress failed to overturn Milei's controversial veto of a law that would have shored up university spending in line with inflation, following mass protests by students and university workers against the measure. Milei has vowed to veto any law that threatens the fiscal balance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-triple-digit-inflation-slows-but-workers-still-struggle-to-pay-bills/7818543.html	2024-10-12T00:46:11-07:00	
River guardians risk own lives as they work to protect, restore Colombia's Atrato	PAIMADO, Colombia — Sediment and pebbles are all that's left on the earth around much of Bernardino Mosquera's small riverside community in northwest Colombia's Choco region. Just a year ago, healthy shrubs and trees filled this important biodiversity spot teeming with species native to the land. But then illegal miners arrived, using their heavy machinery to dredge the riverbeds for gold. 'It's just desert here,' said Mosquera. 'Illegal mining affects the ecosystem in every way … it leads to degraded land. There are no trees. The water sources are drying up, it's polluted by mercury.' Mosquera is a river guardian, a title bestowed upon him and 13 others. The unpaid guardians serve as the eyes and ears of the Atrato River: They liaise with government institutions on environmental and social issues in the face of aggression from armed groups and hope to reverse the devastation they see along the river. But after eight years, they are increasingly disenchanted by the lack of support from institutions and growing threats from armed groups that control the region. Colombia's constitutional court declared in 2016 that the Atrato River running alongside this 2,500-person town was so important to life, it would have rights equivalent to a human. The region is home to thousands of species, with 25% of its plant and bird species endemic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. The river's legal status was a first for Latin America, and when the guardians were established. 'It's an unbreakable marriage between its inhabitants and the rivers,' Mosquera, 62, said. 'That's why we have to defend the Atrato.' Illegal gold mining has become the fastest-growing criminal economy over the past decade in South America. The boom began in Colombia and Peru and expanded to Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil. Illegal mining rife in Choco Paimado, like many towns in the Choco region, is an illegal mining hub firmly in the control of the largest criminal organization in the country, known as Gulf Clan. Early each morning, small wooden boats carry plastic gasoline containers to feed the mining machinery dotted along the Atrato, a river that snakes some 750 kilometers (470 miles) through northern Colombian jungles. Dozens of illegal mines pepper the river between Mosquera's home in Paimado — which lies on Rio Quito, the Atrato River's main tributary — and the state capital Quibdo. Large wooden rafts propped on stilts reach deep into the riverbed to extract material that is sifted through the machine for gold. Deep inside the banks of the river, another type of mining takes place with heavier machinery. It is here that deforestation is glaringly evident. Drone footage taken by The Associated Press shows large patches of empty land that stretch long behind the riverbanks. 'Many people think that because it looks very green there is no deforestation,' said river guardian and agronomist Maryuri Mosquera, 42. High rates of poverty have pushed many into gold mining, work that destroys land and contaminates their river. That destruction then destroys the local economy, making communities even more dependent on mining. Colombia's human rights ombudsman's office said in April the government is failing to protect the river, saying 'there is no evidence of any progress' since the river gained personhood. It called on the environment ministry to comply with the 2016 ruling. In a written response, Colombia's environment ministry said its Minister Susana Muhamad has been coordinating efforts with the Ministry of Defense 'to protect this important ecosystem.' It added that a program will soon begin to work with the communities to restore the Atrato River basin and its tributaries. Community lifeline destroyed The Atrato River has long been an important source of water, food and transport for its rural, mostly Afro-Colombian residents who built communities on the riverbanks. The tiny village of El Arenal along the Atrato is home to river guardian Juan Carlos Palacios, 33, who said that his role is a triumph for the Black communities who fought for the 2016 ruling. 'It makes me feel very sad when I see machinery pass by continually, without any controls. They arrive on our land and we can't even say anything, because the miners come along with armed actors,' Palacios said. For most of his life — even sometimes now — Palacios has been involved in artisanal gold mining. A short canoe ride to the other side of the river from El Arenal is his mother, bent over with a hoe and a wooden gold sifting pan. This has been her life since she can remember. 'I think that if I stop doing this, I'll die quickly, because I'm so used to it,' said Ana Palacios Cuesta with a laugh. 'The dredgers have emptied the whole river, so we hardly get anything anymore.' The tiny amounts of gold sediment she collects are sold in the nearby town of Yuto, or in Quibdo, about 40 minutes away. 'No other option' Mercury and arsenic offer the industrial-scale miners a low-tech solution to extract the gold. But they get pumped into the water, poisoning the river and the surrounding lands. The tactic has been killing marine life, changing the natural flow of the river, and further debilitating some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Palacios, who has a degree in biology, said fish in the river have been 'highly contaminated' by mercury, which gets passed through fish to humans and can cause damage to vital organs. 'Of course we continue to consume them because we have no other option,' he said. Local women and their children stand in the river to wash their dishes and clothes, something only the most rural and needy communities do nowadays over fear of the water's contamination. Guardians face violence, threats The guardians have a precarious job in an area controlled largely by rebel and criminal armed groups, like leftist guerrillas the National Liberation Army and Gulf Clan. Mining machinery along the banks are overseen by these groups and miners are forced to pay them protection money — known locally as 'vacuna' — to be allowed to operate freely without becoming targets. 'The act of raising awareness and denouncing the situations that the Atrato basin is experiencing means we face certain risks,' said guardian Maryuri Mosquera, especially her guardian colleagues in more rural areas. Guardian Bernardino Mosquera has a bulletproof vest provided by the state after he got multiple death threats over the years, the last one in March. He has been kidnapped by Gulf Clan and had bullet shells placed under his door on several occasions 'as warnings.' He almost quit. 'But I realized that if we pull out of the process, we are giving them strength ... no one is going to want to say what is happening, you'll end up riddled with bullets,' Mosquera said as the tropical rain lashed the tin roof of his home. 'We must continue to make the process visible. It's the only way for them (armed groups) to feel that we, too, are in the territory. So that stopped me and made me carry on ... And here I am.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/river-guardians-battle-to-protect-restore-atrato-amid-death-threats/7819850.html	2024-10-12T00:45:27-07:00	
Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage will be celebrated at 50th annual festival	new orleans, louisiana — Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage takes center stage this weekend when the Festivals Acadiens et Creoles marks a half-century of honoring and celebrating the culture through music, arts, food and community. What started as a one day concert in 1974 to entertain 150 French-speaking journalists gathered in Lafayette — considered the heart of Cajun country — has grown into a three-day event and possibly one of the largest Cajun and Zydeco festivals in the world, organizers said. And, they note, the entire event is free. Barry Jean Ancelet, one of the event's organizers, said when the idea formed 50 years ago, nobody knew if anyone would even come to hear the music. 'Cajun music at that time was largely considered 'old people's music,'' he said. 'You've got to remember, we were in the throes of Rock 'n' Roll at the time. The people here loved it when they encountered it in dance halls, but this concert was designed to call attention to the music in a different way, to point out its value. They had to sit — not dance — and pay attention. And they ended up hearing it in a different way. It was so successful. We ended up turning it into an annual event where we could call positive attention to this important asset and get people to consider it.' The festival, now held annually in Lafayette's Girard Park, brings together multi-generations of musicians and artists who annually fight to preserve a culture that continues to evolve. 'We've always been about celebrating the past and handing it off to the future,' Ancelet said. 'If you value and respect evolution, the culture will produce things that will continue to surprise you. It all comes out in the wash. What's good will last and what's not, won't.' Festival co-founder Pat Mould said the festival is a 'self-celebration of who we are, how we live, what we eat, the music and how we speak.' 'If you know nothing and want to learn about the culture, this one weekend out of the year allows you to find out everything. Everything you want to know is represented at the festival. It's a quick study of Cajun and Creole living,' he said. Event features homegrown talent On tap musically for the Friday through Sunday event are performances by 60 musicians — all homegrown talent — including Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Wayne Toups, CJ Chenier, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas, Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, The Revelers, Beausoleil avec Michael Doucet and The Lost Bayou Ramblers. On Friday, contemporary artists will pay tribute to the 1974 concert house band that included Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, Cajun accordion maker Marc Savoy, the Balfa Brothers, a Cajun music ensemble of five brothers, Cajun accordion players Nathan Abshire and Blackie Forrester, and Jimmy C. Newman, a country music and Cajun singer-songwriter and long-time star of the Grand Ole Opry. 'Get ready for Louisiana pure fun,' said Carrier, who's scheduled to perform with his band on Sunday. 'Get ready to eat some really good food and have the time of your life.' 'People all over the word have these dates circled on their calendar,' he continued. 'It's an event that helps the younger generations continue the traditions. I'm a third generation Zydeco musician. This is a family oriented festival that brings people together of all ages.' A 'celebration of everything Cajun' Riley, who's been performing at this festival since 1988, said he keeps returning for several reasons but especially because it helps preserve the culture. 'It's important to see us on stage, singing and speaking in French. That has an effect on people who come to see us and helps them fall in love with the culture,' he said. 'There are a lot of events leading up to the weekend that focuses on the importance of the language, the culture, the food and, of course, the music. There's none other that celebrates it like this one. I think it's the biggest complete celebration of everything Cajun. It's also inclusive of different generations, bands with lineage. That's key,' he said. Riley, now 55, said he's very proud that his three children play music. 'It's a beautiful thing for my family and others like mine,' he said. 'Having your kids play with you is awesome. Most kids don't want to have anything to do with what their parents do. Mine think what I do is fun and it is.' Riley said when he first started there weren't too many young bands playing Cajun music. 'There was real fear that the music would die off and dissipate like the language,' he said. 'The opposite has happened. More young folks are preserving and playing this music than ever. The Zydeco scene down here is packed with young people. It's super vibrant and alive. The same with the Cajun scene as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/louisiana-s-cajun-and-creole-heritage-will-be-showcased-at-50th-annual-festivals-acadiens-et-creoles-/7817127.html	2024-10-12T00:44:19-07:00	
Nazi-looted Monet artwork returned to family generations later	NEW ORLEANS — On the eve of World War II, Nazis in Austria seized a pastel by renowned impressionist artist Claude Monet, selling it off and sparking a family's decadeslong search that culminated Wednesday in New Orleans. At an FBI field office, agents lifted a blue veil covering the Monet pastel and presented Adalbert Parlagi's granddaughters with the artwork over 80 years after it was taken from their family. Helen Lowe said she felt that her grandfather would be watching and that he would be 'so, so proud of this moment.' Monet's 1865 Bord de Mer depicts rocks along the shoreline of the Normandy coast, where Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nazi-occupied France during D-Day in 1944, marking a turning point in the war. The Monet pastel is one of 20,000 items recovered by the FBI Art Crime Team out of an estimated 600,000 artworks and millions of books and religious objects stolen by the Nazis. 'The theft was not random or incidental, but an integral part of the Nazis' plan to eliminate all vestiges of Jewish life in Germany and Europe, root and branch,' U.S. State Department Holocaust adviser Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a March speech. After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Adalbert Parlagi, a successful businessman and art lover, and his wife, Hilda, left behind almost everything they owned and fled Vienna, using British license plates to drive across the border, their granddaughters said. Though the Parlagis hadn't identified as Jewish for years and baptized their children as Protestants, they were still considered Jewish under Nazi laws, according to Austrian government records. Other relatives were killed in concentration camps. The Parlagis attempted to ship their valuable carpets, porcelain and artworks out of Vienna to London, but found out later that their property had been seized and auctioned off by the Gestapo to support the Third Reich. Multiple international declarations decried trading in Nazi-looted art, beginning with Allied forces in London in 1943. The 1998 Washington principles, signed by more than three dozen countries, reiterated the call and advocated for the return of stolen art. Yet Adalbert Parlagi's efforts were stonewalled by the Vienna auctioneer who had bought and sold the Monet pastel and another artwork owned by Parlagi. The records were lost after the fighting in Vienna, the auctioneer told Adalbert in a letter shortly after World War II, according to an English translation of a document prepared by an Austrian government body reviewing the Parlagi family's art restitution claims. 'I also cannot remember two such pictures either,' the auctioneer said. Many survivors of World War II and their descendants ultimately give up trying to recover their lost artwork because of the difficulties they face, said Anne Webber, co-founder of the London-based nonprofit Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has recovered more than 3,500 looted artworks. 'You have to just constantly, constantly, constantly look,' Webber said. Adalbert Parlagi and his son Franz kept meticulous ownership and search records. After Franz's death in 2012, Françoise Parlagi stumbled upon her father's cache of documents, including the original receipt from her grandfather's purchase of the Monet pastel. She reached out to Webber's commission for help in 2014. The commission's research team reviewed archives and receipts, contacted museums and art experts and scoured the internet, but initially found 'absolutely no trace,' Webber said. Then, in 2021, the team discovered online that a New Orleans dealer acquired the Monet in 2017 and sold it to a Louisiana-based doctor and his wife. The FBI investigated the commission's research and, earlier this year, a federal court ruled the pastel should be returned to the Parlagis' descendants. 'There was never a question' of returning the art to the rightful owners after learning of its sordid history, said Bridget Vita-Schlamp, whose late husband had purchased the Monet pastel. 'We were shocked, I'm not going to lie,' she said. The family recovered another work in March from the Austrian government but there are still six more artworks missing, including from acclaimed artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. The U.S. is likely the 'largest illegal art market in the world,' said Kristin Koch, supervisory special agent with the FBI's Art Crime Program. The art world has a greater responsibility to investigate the origins of artworks and a moral obligation to return looted works to their rightful owners, Webber said. 'They represent the life and the lives that were taken,' Webber said. 'They represent the world that they were exiled from.' The granddaughters of Adalbert and Hilda Parlagi say they are grateful for what they have already gotten back. Françoise Parlagi, a broad smile on her face, said she hoped to hang a copy of the pastel in her home. She said the moment felt 'unreal.' 'So many families are in this situation. Maybe they haven't even been trying to recover because they don't believe, they think this might not be possible,' she said. 'Let us be hope for other families.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nazi-looted-monet-artwork-returned-to-family-generations-later/7817126.html	2024-10-12T00:43:27-07:00

US voting systems are targets of conspiracy theories, but get tested for accuracy and security	ATLANTA — Voting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump. There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit. In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections. In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks. What is a voting machine? Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently. Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations. All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices. When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats. Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand. In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand-count is needed. Are voting machines connected to the internet? With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed. Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited. Are voting machines secure? Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016. There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide. 'Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,' the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September. Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised 'serious threats' and have called for a federal investigation. How do election officials ensure accuracy? Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security, such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to ensure votes are being counted correctly. Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors that may have occurred. Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year's election will include a paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that's important for ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from producing an accurate record of the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voting-systems-are-targets-of-conspiracy-theories-but-get-tested-for-accuracy-and-security/7817078.html	2024-10-12T00:41:46-07:00	
China tees up fresh spending to boost ailing economy	beijing — China said Saturday it would issue special bonds to help its sputtering economy, signaling a spending spree to bolster banks, shore up the property market and ease local government debt as part of one of its biggest support packages in years. The plan is part of a series of actions undertaken by Beijing to draw a line under a years-long property sector crisis and chronically low consumption that has plagued the world's second-biggest economy. Beijing's planned special bonds are aimed at boosting the capital available to banks -- part of a push to get them lending in the hopes of firing up sluggish consumer spending. China is also preparing to allow local governments to borrow more to fund the acquisition of unused land for development, aimed at pulling the property market out of a prolonged slump. No figures were provided on the planned special bonds announced at a highly anticipated news conference by Finance Minister Lan Fo'an and other officials, following a series of steps launched in recent weeks that have included interest rate cuts and liquidity for banks. But Lan said China still has room 'to issue debts and increase the deficit' to fund the new measures. Officials have been battling to reverse China's slowdown and achieve a growth target of five percent this year -- enviable for many Western countries but a far cry from the double-digit expansion that for years boosted the Asian giant. On Saturday, Lan said Beijing was 'accelerating the use of additional treasury bonds, and ultra-long-term special treasury bonds are also being issued for use.' 'In the next three months, a total of 2.3 trillion yuan of special bond funds can be arranged for use in various places,' he added. On top of that, Beijing also plans to 'issue special government bonds to support large state-owned commercial banks,' Lan said, although he did not say how much. Chinese authorities have been urging commercial banks to lend more and lower mortgage rates -- measures that would put more cash into the pockets of consumers. Beijing's bonds would therefore offer banks help to shore up their capital, giving them greater leeway to lend more. Bonds for buildings And local governments will be issued special bonds enabling them to acquire unused and idle land for development, Vice Finance Minister Liao Min said, in action that could prop up the housing market. The move would 'help ease liquidity and debt pressures on local governments and real estate companies,' he explained. Beijing will also encourage the acquisition of existing commercial properties to be used as affordable housing. However, analysts expressed frustration that Beijing had refrained from putting a number on further fiscal stimulus. 'The key messages are that ... the central government has the capacity to issue more bonds and raise fiscal deficit, and... the central government plans to issue more bonds to help local governments to pay their debt,' Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said. Beijing was likely 'still working on the minute details of the fiscal stimulus,' Heron Lim at Moody's Analytics told AFP. 'In the meantime, investors might be taking a step back until they are absolutely certain of the direction fiscal policy is taking.' 'Lack of forward guidance' China's economic uncertainty is also fueling a vicious cycle that has kept consumption stubbornly low. Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, said that 'notably absent was any mention of large-scale handouts to consumers' on Saturday. 'The lack of forward guidance on the scale of next year's budget deficit means it is still difficult to judge how large and long-lasting the fiscal boost will be,' he pointed out. Chinese policymakers have in the last weeks unveiled a string of stimulus measures including a suite of rate cuts and a loosening of rules on buying homes, but economists said that more action is needed to pull the economy out of its slump for good. Earlier Saturday, China's top banks said they would cut lower interest rates on existing mortgages from October 25, state media said, following a government call for the action. 'Except for second mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and some other regions, the interest rates on other eligible mortgages will be adjusted' to no less than 30 basis points below the prime lending rate, the central bank's benchmark rate for mortgages, state broadcaster CCTV said. CCTV reported that major banks, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank had announced that they would make the adjustments 'in batches.' The People's Bank of China last month requested that commercial banks lower such rates by October 31. Beijing also last month slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages. And the central bank this week boosted support for markets by opening up tens of billions of dollars in liquidity for firms to buy stocks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tees-up-fresh-spending-to-boost-ailing-economy/7819931.html	2024-10-12T00:38:54-07:00	
Alexey Navalny wrote he knew he would die in prison in new memoir	new york — Russian dissident Alexey Navalny, who was President Vladimir Putin's top political opponent before his death in February, believed he would die in prison, according to his posthumous memoir, which will be released October 22. The New Yorker published excerpts from the book Friday, featuring writing from Navalny's prison diary and earlier. 'I will spend the rest of my life in prison and die here,' he wrote on March 22, 2022. 'There will not be anybody to say goodbye to ... All anniversaries will be celebrated without me. I'll never see my grandchildren.' Navalny had been serving a 19-year prison sentence on 'extremism' charges in an Arctic penal colony. His death on February 16 at age 47 drew widespread condemnation, with many blaming Putin. Navalny was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Russia after suffering a major health emergency from being poisoned in 2020. 'The only thing we should fear is that we will surrender our homeland to be plundered by a gang of liars, thieves, and hypocrites,' he wrote on January 17, 2022. The excerpts capture the loneliness of imprisonment, but also a touch of humor. For instance, on July 1, 2022, Navalny outlined his typical day: wake up at 6 a.m., breakfast at 6:20 a.m. and start work at 6:40 a.m. 'At work, you sit for seven hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height,' he wrote. 'After work, you continue to sit for a few hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called 'disciplinary activity.'' The book, entitled Patriot, will be released by U.S. publisher Knopf, which is also planning a Russian version. 'It's impossible to read Navalny's prison diary without being outraged by the tragedy of his suffering, and by his death,' wrote New Yorker editor David Remnick. In the last excerpt published in the magazine, dated January 17, 2024, Navalny responds to the question asked to him by his fellow inmates and prison guards: Why did he return to Russia? 'I don't want to give up my country or betray it. If your convictions mean something, you must be prepared to stand up for them and make sacrifices if necessary,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alexey-navalny-wrote-he-knew-he-would-die-in-prison-in-new-memoir/7819927.html	2024-10-12T00:18:14-07:00	
Israel observes Yom Kippur amid firestorm over Lebanon strikes	Jerusalem — Israel observed Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, on Saturday amid a firestorm of international criticism over its military offensive in Lebanon and its soldiers firing on peacekeepers. As the holy day got under way Friday from sundown, Israel faced diplomatic backlash over what it acknowledged was a 'hit' earlier in the day on a United Nations peacekeeping position in Lebanon. Two Sri Lankan peacekeepers were hurt in the second such incident in two days, the UNIFIL mission said Friday. The military said Israeli soldiers had responded with fire to 'an immediate threat' around 50 meters from the UNIFIL post. As Israel faced a chorus of condemnation from UN chief Antonio Guterres and Western allies, the military pledged to carry out a 'thorough review.' Lebanese militant group Hezbollah meanwhile warned Israelis to stay away from Israeli army sites in residential areas in the north of the country, alleging the military 'uses the homes' of locals and has military bases in residential neighborhoods. Hezbollah has repeatedly announced it has fired rockets at areas in northern Israel, where sirens blared in multiple locations early Saturday. 'Outrage' The UNIFIL peacekeepers have found themselves on the frontline of the Israel-Hezbollah war, which has killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally of Lebanese health ministry figures. The latest incident came a day after two Indonesian soldiers were hurt when, according to UNIFIL, tank fire hit a watchtower. Sean Clancy, the Irish military's chief of staff, said he did not believe Israel's explanation of Friday's incident. 'So from a military perspective, this is not an accidental act,' said Clancy, whose country has troops in UNIFIL. Guterres condemned the firing as 'intolerable' and 'a violation of international humanitarian law,' while the British government said it was 'appalled' by reports of the wounded. U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he was 'absolutely' asking Israel to stop firing at UN peacekeepers, while the French, Spanish and Italian leaders issued a joint statement expressing 'outrage.' French President Emmanuel Macron renewed his call for an end to exports of weapons used by Israel in Gaza and Lebanon, while saying the UN peacekeepers had been 'deliberately targeted.' The incidents came more than two weeks into Israel's war with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has seen Israeli warplanes conduct extensive strikes since September 23 on the militants' strongholds, with multiple civilian areas hit, and ground troops deployed across the border. 'Immediate cease-fire' Israeli and Hezbollah forces fought along the border on Friday, with Israeli air strikes reported in the south and east of Lebanon. It marked a tense start to Yom Kippur. From sundown on Friday until nightfall on Saturday, Israeli markets are closed, flights stopped and public transport halted as observant Jews fast and pray on the Day of Atonement. Diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza have so far failed, but Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said his government would ask the UN Security Council to issue a new resolution calling for a 'full and immediate ceasefire.' Leaders from nine European countries around the Mediterranean Sea on Friday also called for an end to fighting in Lebanon, as well as Gaza. Mikati said that only the Lebanese military and peacekeepers should be deployed in the south of the country -- the essence of existing Security Council Resolution 1701 -- and 'Hezbollah is in agreement on this issue.' U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein said the United States was working 'non-stop' towards a cease-fire. 'We want the whole conflict to end,' he told Lebanese television channel LBC from Washington. Lebanon's military said an Israeli strike on one of its positions in south Lebanon killed two of its soldiers on Friday. Hezbollah is heavily armed and controls large swathes of Lebanon, and successive Lebanese governments have failed to subdue it. The movement also fought Israeli troops during Israel's last invasion in 2006. Beirut attack In Beirut, residents of a central area of the capital targeted by twin Israeli air strikes on Thursday night salvaged their possessions and cleared rubble from the devastated streets. 'There are a lot of families living here,' said Bilal Othman, who explained that many people had sought shelter there from southern Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold, which has been pummeled by Israeli raids since last month. 'Do they want to tell us there is no safe place left in this country?' he said. The Israeli strikes apparently targeted Hezbollah's security chief Wafiq Safa, a source close to Hezbollah told AFP. Lebanon's health ministry said the strikes killed 22 people and wounded more than 100. Safa was close to Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike on south Beirut last month. Children in Gaza Hezbollah began firing on Israel in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas, following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. Israel's military campaign has wrought devastation on Gaza and, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, killed 42,126 people, mostly civilians. Late Friday, Gaza's civil defense agency reported 30 people killed in Israeli strikes on Jabalia, north Gaza. An AFP journalist in Gaza reported heavy artillery shelling, explosions and gunfire Saturday further south in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood. The co-head of a Japanese atomic bomb survivors' group awarded the Nobel Peace Prize said the situation for children in Gaza reminded him of the plight of survivors after World War II. 'It's like in Japan 80 years ago,' Toshiyuki Mimaki said in Tokyo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-observes-yom-kippur-amid-firestorm-over-lebanon-strikes/7819922.html	2024-10-12T00:02:21-07:00	
Florida residents slog through aftermath of Hurricane Milton	LITHIA, Florida — Florida residents slogged through flooded streets, gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes. At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized. Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects. 'We're now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,' DeSantis said. 'You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.' As of Friday night, the number of customers in Florida still without power had dropped to 1.9 million, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday. Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane. The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay. The company said the leak was fixed Thursday. Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 66,245-liter minimum reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the total volume might have been. Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about Riverview and the company's other Florida mines received no response, as did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas. Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer. Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel. Florida's vital tourism industry has started to return to normal, meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The state's busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday. Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane. Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on Friday were assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 40 kilometers long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of Tampa, into Tampa Bay. In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise. Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now headed to a hotel in Orlando. 'I'm extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,' Cabrera said. 'I thought we'd be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I've lived here.' Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm. 'I'm high and dry where I'm at, and I have a barn and 9 acres (3.6 hectares),' Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find the animals' owners. In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind dozens of centimeters of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails poking out. Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 2.4 meters of seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121 people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at least 1.5 meters of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three people. 'So people listened to the evacuation order,' Matthews said. Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida Citrus Mutual said Friday. Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage. Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years, with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said. In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an upstairs neighbor opened their home to them. Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away from the building. 'Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,' Glenn said. Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is $160 a night. Everything inside Glenn's apartment is gone. And it can take time to get assistance. 'I ain't going to say we're homeless,' Glenn said. 'But we've got to start all over again.' The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Friday. The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount as last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-residents-slog-through-aftermath-of-hurricane-milton/7819902.html	2024-10-11T20:56:03-07:00

Meta removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election	STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's October 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts. Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast 'no' ballots in a referendum on European Union membership held alongside the presidential election. Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies. The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said. The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok. Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its 'coordinated inauthentic behavior policy.' About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said. In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels 'violated local laws' on political party financing. It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the 'Victory' electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in Moscow. Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote. Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters. Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting 'Russophobia.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-removes-fake-accounts-in-moldova-ahead-of-presidential-election-/7819601.html	2024-10-11T16:45:31-07:00	
US sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law	washington — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election. On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting 'daily updates to the voter list' to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles. U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the November 5 election. 'By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate,' said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. 'Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters,' Clarke added. The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations. Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to interfere in the election. 'With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every resource available to us,' he said in a statement on Friday. Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting, which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sues-virginia-over-alleged-violation-of-federal-election-law-/7819619.html	2024-10-11T16:38:16-07:00

Experts: Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains uncertain	washington — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State Department as 'a significant accomplishment,' will survive if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year. Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by 8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year. The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S. presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican Party candidate. The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a 'a significant accomplishment for both sides' in a statement released on October 4. But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time magazine that 'I want South Korea to treat us properly,' adding that Seoul is 'paying virtually nothing for' the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. ‘Trump factor’ John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that 'it’s very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.' 'I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,' said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06. 'He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand collective defense alliances,' Bolton said. 'He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these countries don’t pay us enough money.' The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s formal name. Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is 'an executive agreement,' which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require approval from Congress. 'We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay much more,' Klingner said. 'If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed domestically.' Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn't pass muster with a Trump administration should the former president win a second term in November. 'Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,' said Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in 2013-14 and in 2019-21. Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via email that he suspected there was 'considerable dissatisfaction with the recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,' knowing how strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue. Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will come up with 'a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that end, he might make major new demands of Seoul' if he takes office again. 'It's in our interest' Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing agreement between the U.S. and South Korea. Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the phone, 'He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too soon.' 'If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state, defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.' 'Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,' Armitage said. 'But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.' VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published. Joeun Lee contributed to this report, which originated in VOA’s Korean Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-future-of-us-south-korea-defense-cost-sharing-deal-remains-uncertain-/7819599.html	2024-10-11T16:05:34-07:00	
US soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic State	washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S. troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday. Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the department said. Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was charged in 2021 with giving 'military advice and guidance on how to kill fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS,' the department said. Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined the Army in 2019. Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and consuming online propaganda 'promoting jihadists and their violent ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social media.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-soldier-sentenced-to-14-years-in-prison-for-attempting-to-assist-islamic-state-/7819588.html	2024-10-11T15:45:54-07:00	
Despite tariffs, China drives toward dominating EV market all over world	washington — As China pursues tit-for-tat actions against the European Union in response to tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, Beijing's drive for global dominance in the automotive sector continues unabated. Over the past year, companies such as EV giant BYD and others have made inroads in markets from Southeast Asia to Latin America and Africa, even as they face tariffs of up to 100% in Canada and the United States, and up to 45% in the European Union. Chinese EV companies have announced plans to invest millions to build new factories in Thailand and Brazil, and they have opened showrooms in Zambia, Kenya and South Africa. And while most Chinese EV makers say they will continue to sell cars in Europe and not boost prices to offset the tariffs, analysts say it makes sense that they are equally focused, if not more so, on markets in the developing world as well. Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the EV market is like a balloon that is fully blown up. 'When countries like the U.S., the EU, Canada and others squeeze [the balloon], the air is going to go elsewhere. Well, the air right now is going to go to the developing world countries that haven't put the tariffs on Chinese cars in the first place,' Berg said. Bangkok, Brazil and Ethiopia In Thailand, companies such as Great Wall and BYD are leading the way. BYD opened a production facility in Thailand in July and its company chairman, Wang Chuanfu, said BYD has already captured 40% of the market for EVs. Earlier this year, Great Wall became the first Chinese EV company to mass-produce electric vehicles overseas through its production facilities in Thailand. In addition to Thailand, BYD has also captured a large market share in Singapore and Malaysia. According to government statistics, the EV behemoth ranked as Singapore's second-most popular car brand by sales in the first half of 2024. BYD ranked among the top 10 car brands in Malaysia when compared with all registered vehicles, following BMW and Mercedes-Benz. In Latin America, BYD plans to launch a partnership with Uber that aims to bring 100,000 Chinese-made EVs to Uber drivers globally. In addition, BYD is planning a new auto factory in eastern Brazil to come online in 2025. Both BYD and Great Wall have local R&D, production and sales centers in Brazil. John Helveston, an assistant professor in engineering management at George Washington University, said from a business perspective, it makes sense for Chinese EV companies to move to markets where there is more room for profit. 'I mean, just like we have Toyota and GM and Ford and Volkswagen … these companies like BYD very much are also global companies,' Helveston told VOA. 'They want to expand just like any other successful business.' Paul Nantulya, a China specialist at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, said Africa provides huge market opportunities for Chinese EV companies. That opportunity, however, comes with its challenges. As in other countries, there is still a lack of infrastructure for EVs in Africa such as charging stations. Nantulya, who attended the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), said Beijing and Africa are building long-term relationships, particularly when it comes to green energy and EV sectors. About '122 green energy projects have been implemented since the last FOCAC, so between 2021 and 2024, 122 green energy projects have been implemented across the African continent across 40 countries. So, the demand is huge, and it is steady,' he told VOA. 'Chinese state-owned enterprises that are in this sector have been making a very, very aggressive push in developing economies … you know, the uptick of that technology in Africa is extremely high,' he said. In March, China partnered with Ethiopia to announce an ambitious plan to shift toward electric mobility. The plan aims to introduce nearly half a million electric vehicles in Ethiopia over the next decade. Mutual benefits All three analysts said Beijing's penetration of global markets is boosted by the economic benefits that China offers in exchange. For example, Helveston said, many countries are willing to 'leverage market access' in exchange for improved infrastructure and technology. Chinese companies have built roads, trains, schools and hospitals in some of the poorest countries in the world, and developing countries see 'automotive trade [as] just building on top of those relationships that have already been there a while,' he said. 'It's a very transactional relationship.' CSIS's Berg said countries in Latin America 'have been really keen to court Chinese investment in technological industries like the EV industry.' He noted that Latin American countries see the EV industry as 'reliable' and 'plentiful in terms of job opportunities.' Nantulya added that Chinese technology is seen as a way to help African countries address energy challenges such as blackouts. 'When you look at it from the African perspective, [China's presence] is helping them diversify their energy grids, which is a significant issue. It's also contributing to improving their energy mix,' Nantulya said. China has taken a proactive approach by building large infrastructure projects in developing countries, whereas the United States has not yet undertaken projects of similar scale, he said. 'I think that we're looking at some pretty big shifts in, let's say, 10 years from now with what the global situation might be. … A lot of these countries might be much more comfortable working with China than the U.S.,' Helveston said. Washington, however, is not sitting back. At the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in 2022, the United States committed to $55 billion in pledges over three years that included investments in renewable energy infrastructure, clean energy and efforts to mitigate climate change. Berg said geopolitics also is a motivating factor in Beijing's push into developing countries in South America. 'They are in their geopolitical competition with [the United States], engaging in reciprocity ... showing that they can be extremely active in some ways and especially in the economic domain in our neighborhood,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-tariffs-china-drives-toward-dominating-ev-market-all-over-world/7819564.html	2024-10-11T15:42:30-07:00	
Boeing lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737 Max crashes	fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on trial. Their lawyers argued that Boeing's punishment — mainly a fine amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a defendant. The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing 'is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense' and needs to know the punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from federal contracting. 'All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company and a global and national supply chain ... all of those are put into doubt if the sentencing' isn't known, possibly for months, Hatch said. The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims. 'Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,' Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash, said after the hearing. 'It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.' The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal that they struck in July. Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors can bring — they can't prove that Boeing's deception of regulators caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky. 'We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we might not win,' he said. The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the passengers' families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about 'Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.' 'You have given me a lot to think about,' O'Connor said to all the lawyers as Friday's hearing ended. 'I'll get a ruling out just as soon as I can.' In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements for the Max. The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737. That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the Max. Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in Ethiopia. The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021 to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal. Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation for three years. The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most contend. Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its offer and S&P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing increased financial risk because of the labor unrest. On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and has made it difficult to reach a resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7819575.html	2024-10-11T15:04:49-07:00	
UK government is urged to raise pro-democracy tycoon's case with China	london — The U.K. government was urged Friday to raise the case of jailed pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai with China, after reports that David Lammy, the foreign minister, is heading to Beijing. Lai, 76, is the founder of the now-shuttered popular Chinese-language tabloid Apple Daily, which supported mass pro-democracy protests in the economic hub. Detained in 2020, he is awaiting trial on charges including colluding with foreign forces and sedition. In London, his legal team said they hoped Lammy would put Lai's case 'front and center' during his visit, which has not been confirmed by his department. Lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher told reporters it had been 'made crystal clear to the U.K.' government that if it is looking to reset relations with China, it needed to use the case 'as leverage to ensure that Jimmy Lai is released.' At a Reporters Without Borders (RSF) event in London, Lai's son Sebastien said his father, who holds British citizenship, was in deteriorating health after being in prolonged solitary confinement for nearly four years. 'His health could get much worse at any time,' he added. Lai's delayed trial began in December 2023, and he is due to testify for the first time on November 20. 'The [U.K.] government does need to stand behind him - much stronger than they even have before,' said Sebastien Lai. Give priority to it Both the legal team and Sebastien have met U.K. foreign ministry officials, but Gallagher said they were disappointed that neither Lammy nor British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had yet met Lai's son. 'If this is a top-priority case for the U.K. government, why is Sebastien not being met by the foreign secretary directly?' asked Gallagher. 'Why is Sebastien not being met by the prime minister directly?' Gallagher works for the law firm Doughty Street Chambers, where Starmer made his name as a human rights lawyer before entering politics. The U.K. Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in response said Lammy had raised Lai's case when he met his Chinese counterpart in July. 'British national Jimmy Lai's case is a priority for the U.K. government,' an FCDO spokesperson added. 'We continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and immediately release Jimmy Lai.' Lai denies the charges, which were brought under sweeping national security laws meant to quell dissent in the former British colony, which was returned to China in 1997. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment. Six other senior Apple Daily staff members are also in prison. Britain has been critical of China's crackdown on press freedom and protests in Hong Kong, which has strained diplomatic ties. RSF head of campaigns Rebecca Vincent said no one from the organization would be able to attend Lai's trial. A staff member was detained and deported while trying to enter Hong Kong to monitor the trial previously.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-government-is-urged-to-raise-pro-democracy-tycoon-s-case-with-china-/7819577.html	2024-10-11T15:00:08-07:00	
Sky-gazers treated to another aurora show	paris — Scientist Jim Wild has traveled to the Arctic Circle numerous times to study the northern lights, but Thursday night he needed only to look out of his bedroom window in Lancaster, England. For at least the second time this year, sky-gazers in many parts of the world were treated to colorful auroras at latitudes beyond the polar extremes where they normally light up the skies. The dazzling celestial shows were caused by a gigantic ball of plasma — and an accompanying magnetic field — that erupted from the sun earlier this week. When this eruption, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), arrived at Earth about 1600 GMT on Thursday, it triggered a strong geomagnetic storm. This storm in turn sparked northern and southern lights — aurora borealis and aurora australis — in swaths of Europe, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. While Wild could see the shimmering reds and greens from his back garden, he jumped in the car with his family to get a better look away from the bright lights of Lancaster. 'All the little backroads and parking spots were full of people with flasks of coffee and deck chairs looking at the northern lights,' he told AFP. 'It was a party atmosphere,' he said, comparing the scenes to UFO spotters looking up at the sky in the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' While Wild was explaining the phenomenon to his 11- and 13-year-old children, another nearby sky-gazer approached and asked how come he knew so much about it. 'Well, actually, this is what I study for a living,' responded the professor in space physics at Lancaster University, who specializes in how solar weather disrupts power grids and transport here on Earth. Perfect hit Auroras were also visible across northern Europe, including near London and Berlin, and as far south in the U.S. as the state of Georgia. In the Southern Hemisphere, areas of Australia and New Zealand were also treated to a show, AFP photos showed. The CME that triggered Thursday's auroras erupted from a spot on the sun pointed directly at Earth, said Juha-Pekka Luntama, the head of the European Space Agency's Space Weather Office. 'It was a perfect hit,' he told AFP. The CME caused a 'severe' geomagnetic storm given a rating of G4. This fell narrowly short of the highest level of G5, which was seen in May, when auroras delighted many sky-gazers across swaths of the world. Storms on the sun have been intensifying as solar activity approaches — or may have already reached — the peak of its 11-year cycle. While such storms offer pretty light shows for sky-gazers, they can pose a serious threat to satellites, GPS services, power grids and even astronauts in space. The U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday that the geomagnetic storm could disrupt emergency services already stretched thin by two deadly hurricanes, Helene and Milton. Luntama said the European Space Agency had not received any information about disruptions caused by the latest storm, but sometimes this can take days. The storm is 'gradually dissipating,' he added, which means that any auroras seen Friday night or over the weekend will likely be farther north in Europe, such as central Sweden. Delighted But for those still hoping to see an aurora, there could be some more chances in the next couple of years. Luntama explained that during past solar cycles, the biggest eruptions have come in the two years after the sun passed its peak. Wild also did not expect a repeat of Thursday's 'magical' display. But space weather — like Earth's weather — is not an 'exact art,' he emphasized. And if there is an aurora lighting up the sky nearby, it is worth seeking out. Wild said his neighbors had traveled to Norway twice to see the northern lights, but had been foiled by clouds both times. Then, Thursday night, they saw an aurora from their garden. 'They were really delighted to finally have seen it,' Wild said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sky-gazers-treated-to-another-aurora-show-/7819567.html	2024-10-11T14:47:49-07:00	
Exclusive: Hezbollah running out of money amid Israeli bombardment	WASHINGTON — Lebanese militia Hezbollah is running out of money, researchers tell VOA, as a weekslong Israeli offensive against the Iran-backed group disrupts three of its key sources of cash. U.S. and Lebanon-based researchers and U.S. Treasury Department reports identify Hezbollah’s main cash source as Al-Qard al-Hasan, or AQAH, a Lebanese quasi-banking institution operated by the U.S.-designated terror group without a government banking license. The researchers say the group’s other cash sources include Lebanon’s insolvent but licensed commercial banks and arrivals of cash-bearing planes at Beirut’s airport. The Israeli military escalated its attacks on Hezbollah leaders and facilities last month, after 11 months of limiting its responses to the militia’s daily attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas. The Palestinian terror group, also backed by Iran, invaded southern Israel from Gaza last October, sparking a fierce Israeli response. Hezbollah founded AQAH in 1982 as a charitable institution providing interest-free loans to needy Lebanese, primarily fellow Shiites, according to Israel's Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, or ITIC, a nongovernmental research group of Israeli intelligence community veterans. ITIC says AQAH has since grown into a major institution with branches in Hezbollah’s southern Beirut stronghold of Dahiyeh and other Hezbollah-dominated parts of Lebanon. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned AQAH in 2007. In a 2021 announcement of further sanctions on AQAH employees, it said the institution had amassed about half a billion dollars. AQAH was hit hard by Israel’s initial airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Dahiyeh in late September, according to MTV Lebanon, one of the country’s leading TV networks. In a September 30 Arabic-language report, MTV Lebanon said the Israeli airstrikes had targeted Hezbollah’s 'cash storage centers, including a large part of the AQAH vaults,' leaving the group in what it called a 'financial crisis.' Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut, said in a Wednesday phone interview that Israel 'destroyed' most of AQAH’s branches in the airstrikes. 'Hezbollah is facing a very serious financial problem. They are unable to pay rank and file members who have fled their homes and need to feed their families,' Khashan said. The Treasury Department’s 2021 announcement of sanctions against six AQAH employees said they had used personal accounts at licensed Lebanese banks to transfer more than $500 million to and from AQAH over the previous decade. It said that activity gave AQAH access to the international financial system through the employees’ personal accounts at the Lebanese banks. David Asher, a former U.S. Defense and State Department official who targeted Hezbollah’s global drug trafficking and money laundering networks, said in a separate interview Wednesday that the group is in 'deep trouble' because it also is losing access to the Lebanese banking system. 'I’m hearing from Lebanese bankers, including Hezbollah financiers, that Lebanon’s wealthiest bankers who can afford to fly have fled to Europe and the Gulf, fearing they could be targeted next by Israel for helping Hezbollah,' said Asher, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Hudson Institute. Asher said he is in contact with Lebanon-based sources whom the U.S. recruited over the years to provide information about Hezbollah. 'These Lebanese bankers, most of them billionaires, see the wind is blowing against Hezbollah, so they are not going to let it take millions of dollars out of their banks, which still have cash despite being bankrupt on paper,' Asher said. 'They know that if they do, Israel probably will eliminate them, too.' Another Hezbollah funding source that has dried up, according to Asher and Khashan, is deliveries of cash on planes flying to Beirut’s airport, particularly from Iran, the group’s main patron. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari told reporters on September 27 that Israeli warplanes had begun patrolling the airspace of Beirut’s airport and would not allow hostile flights carrying weapons to land at a civilian facility. He did not mention the issue of cash being transported aboard what Israel deems to be hostile flights. The next day, Lebanon’s Transport Ministry told Lebanese and Western media that it ordered an Iranian plane bound for Beirut to turn away from Lebanese airspace. The ministry attributed the move to an Israeli warning to Beirut’s air traffic control tower that Israel would use force if the plane landed there. 'I’ve heard from my Israeli counterparts that the Iranians are scared to send money to Lebanon right now because Israel is threatening to target flights into Beirut. The Israelis are warning they will target flights full of money, not just weapons,' Asher said. Khashan said Iran used to organize regular flights from Tehran to Beirut to smuggle cash to Hezbollah without going through the Lebanese government's customs department. 'In the weeks since Israel escalated its attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, the Lebanese government has asserted more control over the airport, and now there is no cash flow to Hezbollah,' Khashan said. Lebanese Minister of Public Works and Transport Ali Hamieh told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the Beirut airport 'is subject to Lebanese laws and to the scrutiny of various relevant departments and security agencies.' Hamieh added that any plane carrying weapons must be approved by the Lebanese army and be licensed by his ministry. Saudi TV network Al Arabiya in a Thursday report cited a Lebanese army source saying the army and other security agencies have been 'scrambling' to assert control over the airport by starting inspections of cargo shipments to ensure their contents are as declared. Khashan said Hezbollah’s lack of cash is unlikely to stop its thousands of operatives from fighting Israeli forces anytime soon. 'Keeping up the fight depends more on the availability of food and ammunition,' he said. 'When your fight is motivated by religious zeal, you have more fundamental issues to worry about than the availability of cash.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/exclusive-hezbollah-running-out-of-money-amid-israeli-bombardment/7819533.html	2024-10-11T14:30:34-07:00	
US expands sanctions against Iran's oil industry after attack on Israel	washington — The United States hit Iran's oil and petrochemicals sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms. In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going after Iran's so-called 'shadow fleet' of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10 companies and 17 vessels as 'blocked property' over their involvement in 'shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.' The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six firms and six ships for 'knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.' The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran's attack, in which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a general from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Israel has said its response to Iran's second direct attack against its territory this year would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising.' U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should consider 'other alternatives than striking oil fields,' amid reports it was planning to do so. 'In response to Iran's attack on Israel, the United States is taking decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime's ability to fund and carry out its destabilizing activity,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'Today's sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity — including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles,' she added. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. 'To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East,' he said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-expands-sanctions-against-iran-s-oil-industry-after-attack-on-israel/7819539.html	2024-10-11T14:28:32-07:00	
Iran says it has recovered body of general killed alongside Nasrallah	Tehran, Iran — Iran said Friday that it had recovered the body of a Revolutionary Guard general killed alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli strike last month in Beirut. 'With hard work and efforts around the clock, the body of martyr Abbas Nilforushan has been discovered,' the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement. 'The time of transferring the body of martyr Nilforushan to the Islamic homeland and the funeral and burial plans will be announced later,' the statement said. Nilforushan, a top commander of the Quds Force, the IRGC's foreign operations arm, was killed September 27 alongside Nasrallah. On October 1, the Revolutionary Guards fired 200 missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of the general, as well as Nasrallah and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in late July. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed this week that his country's response would be 'deadly, precise and surprising.' Iran has promised to respond if it is targeted by arch-enemy Israel. In an address to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, said the Islamic Republic 'stands fully prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression targeting its vital interests and security.' Iran, he said, was not seeking 'war or escalation' but would exercise its 'inherent right to self-defense fully in line with international law and will notify the Security Council of its legitimate response.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-has-recovered-body-of-general-killed-alongside-nasrallah-/7819547.html	2024-10-11T14:18:53-07:00	
Russian, Iranian presidents meet as concerns grow over Middle East attacks	ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan — Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iran’s president Friday, at a time when Tehran is supplying weapons for Moscow’s war in Ukraine and concerns are growing over escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its militant allies. Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian discussed the situation in the Middle East on the sidelines of an international forum in the Turkmen capital, Ashgabat, Russian state media said. Moscow and Tehran signed a $1.7 billion deal for Iran to export drones to Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, and the U.S. also believes it has transferred short-range ballistic missiles. Both countries were accused this week by Ken McCallum, the head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency MI5, of carrying out a 'staggering' rise in attempts at assassination, sabotage and other crimes on U.K. soil. McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 'potentially lethal' plots backed by Iran since 2022 and warned that it could expand its targets in the U.K. if conflicts in the Middle East deepen. During the two presidents' meeting, Putin told Pezeshkian that Moscow and Tehran's positions on international events are often very close, according to Russian state news agency Tass. He also invited the Iranian leader to visit Russia and Pezeshkian accepted, Tass said. 'We have many opportunities now, and we must help each other in our relationships. Our principles, our positions in the international arena are similar to yours,' Pezeshkian said at the start of his meeting with Putin. Pezeshkian said that Israel's 'savage attacks,' on Lebanon are 'beyond description.' The Israeli military sent ground troops into southern Lebanon and is carrying out airstrikes in the country against Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. Speaking Friday as the forum opened, Putin said he wants to create a 'new world order' of Moscow’s allies to counter the West, according to video provided by the Kremlin. The conference is being attended by other regional leaders including Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and the heads of the other Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Putin is also expected to hold talks with Turkmen President Serdar Berdymukhamedov. Berdymukhamedov was elected in March 2022 to succeed his father, Gurbanguly, who had run the gas-rich country since 2006. Turkmenistan has remained largely isolated under autocratic rulers since it became independent following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-iranian-presidents-meet-as-concerns-grow-over-middle-east-attacks-/7819540.html	2024-10-11T14:12:11-07:00	
Report focuses attention on Serbia's spread of Russian propaganda	washington — A media watchdog group's report is prompting renewed scrutiny of the role Serbia is playing in the dissemination of Russian propaganda in the Balkans, particularly as it concerns Moscow's war on Ukraine. 'Thanks to the Serbian government's grip on the media and favorable political environment, RT — formerly Russia Today — uses its Belgrade office to adapt the Kremlin's narratives before disseminating them across southeastern Europe,' said the report from Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which was updated early this week. The Paris-based watchdog group added that it 'calls on the European Union (EU) and its member states to hold Serbia accountable for hosting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's factory of lies.' The EU's response was not long in coming. On Tuesday, EU spokesperson for external affairs Peter Stano called on Serbia to take urgent measures to counter Russian media manipulation and interference. 'The European Union has adopted sanctions against Russian state-owned media, including RT,' Stano told Agence France-Presse, adding that those outlets have become an instrument of Russia's war against Ukraine and 'a channel for the dissemination and manipulation of information.' A day earlier, Pavol Szalai, head of the Europe and Balkans desk at RSF, told AFP that the Serbian government was allowing the country, an EU candidate nation, to be used as 'an amplifier and translator of Kremlin propaganda in the Balkans.' In a post on X, Arno Guyon, who heads the Serbian government's Office for Public and Cultural Diplomacy, responded to the comments by the EU's Stano and RSF's Szalai, calling them 'very worrying.' 'It reminds of the period of communism during which censorship was applied in Yugoslavia in the name of fighting against 'harmful or undesirable ideas.' It contradicts the values of pluralism, tolerance and freedom of speech, which the Serbs believe in and for which numerous Serbian intellectuals who were imprisoned and killed because of it fought.' Asked by VOA's Serbian Service about the accusations concerning the Serbian government's alleged role in disseminating Russian disinformation, the U.S. State Department responded: 'Media manipulation and interference poses significant risks to democratic processes and societal stability in Serbia and the Western Balkans. The Department of State's Global Engagement Center previously warned that the Kremlin's state-funded and state-directed media outlets RT and Sputnik are critical elements in Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.' The State Department added that it would continue its cooperation with Serbian partners in responding to RT's activities. In September, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration announced new measures to thwart the activities of the Russian state-funded and -directed media company Rossiya Segodnya, and five of its subsidiaries, including RT. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said those Russian state media entities 'are no longer merely firehoses of Russian Government propaganda and disinformation,' but are engaged in 'covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracies, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus.' 'Thanks to new information — much of which originates from RT employees — we know that RT possess cyber capabilities and engaged in covert information and influence operations and military procurement,' Blinken said. 'As part of RT's expanded capabilities, the Russian Government embedded within RT a unit with cyber operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence. RT's leadership had direct, witting knowledge of this enterprise.' RT Balkan, which has existed in Serbia since 2022, publishes its content on the internet and social media. Sputnik Serbia, a subsidiary of Russia's Sputnik state news agency, arrived in the country a little earlier, in 2017. Ruslan Trad, a resident fellow for security research with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told VOA that the Serbian government is providing Russia with a platform for building a serious infrastructure, which also includes a media presence. 'Russian propaganda media use Serbia to establish a presence in the wider region,' he said. 'They use different methods, such as advertising platforms on Google that users have confidence in, in order to redirect them to the contents of 'Russia Today' or other Russian or pro-Russian media in the Serbian language.' Trad believes that the Serbian authorities will ignore the criticism expressed by the European Union and non-governmental organizations. 'Belgrade 's position is clear. The European Union, which has economic interests in Serbia related to lithium, will do little more than comment,' he said. '[Serbian President Aleksandar] Vucic doesn't see it as a problem, so things will continue to work in the same way.' Still, Trad said the Serbian government's relationships with Russia and the West are provisional, not set in stone. 'It is obvious that Belgrade enables all this out of interest, and not because it is pressed against the wall,' he said. 'Unlike other countries in the region, Serbia sees the Russian Federation as an ally, but not as a partner at any cost. It is no coincidence that Belgrade also has ties with China, the U.S. and European countries such as France.' He added: 'However, if it wants to become a part of the European family, Belgrade will have to implement the rule of law and improve the situation in the media environment.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-focuses-attention-on-serbia-s-spread-of-russian-propaganda/7819500.html	2024-10-11T13:55:25-07:00	
EU condemns China for human rights violations against Uyghurs	London — The European Parliament overwhelmingly passed an emergency resolution Thursday condemning the Chinese government's persecution of Uyghurs and urging China to immediately and unconditionally release detainees, including Uyghur economist Ilham Tohti and Gulshan Abbas. The resolution is fueled by widespread concern from the international community and highlights its continued concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The resolution, which was adopted by a vote of 540 in favor, 23 against and 47 abstentions, strongly condemns China's 'repression and targeting of Uyghurs with abusive policies, including intense surveillance, forced labor, sterilization, birth prevention measures and the destruction of Uyghur identity, which amount to crimes against humanity and a serious risk of genocide.' The European Parliament's resolution pays attention to the cases of two high-profile Uyghurs. Ilham Tohti, a 54-year-old economist, was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 on charges of 'separatism.' Tohti has long worked to promote dialogue between Uyghurs and the Han Chinese and is considered a moderate intellectual. In 2019, the European Parliament awarded him the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for his efforts to uphold human rights. Gulshan Abbas, a 62-year-old retired doctor, was detained in 2018 and sentenced to 20 years in prison on terrorism-related charges. Abbas's sister, Rushan Abbas, is a Uyghur human rights activist in the United States. Ziba Murat, daughter of Gulshan Abbas, told the nonprofit group International Services for Human Rights, 'My mother was a medical professional who dedicated her life to helping others and saving lives. She is a non-politicized, warm-hearted and loving mother. The accusations against her are absurd and baseless. My mother is suffering only because her family in the United States has spoken out against the Chinese government's unfair treatment of Uyghurs. This is an obvious example of kinship punishment and transnational repression.' Rushan Abbas told VOA, 'The adoption of this resolution by the European Parliament signifies more than symbolic recognition; it is a decisive step toward accountability and justice for the countless Uyghur lives devastated by China’s oppressive policies, including my sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas and Ilham Tohti. It is imperative that EU member states not only recognize their moral duty but also seize this political moment to implement sanctions that reinforce this resolution. Our collective demand for justice and the protection of human rights must manifest in substantive measures.' Rahima Mahmut, executive director of the group Stop Uyghur Genocide, told VOA, 'I welcome this decision that is so important. In my opinion, especially for Ilham Tohti’s 10th anniversary this year, and then along with so many thousands of intellectuals, linguistics, artists, scholars, religious leaders and many, many imprisoned unlawfully, serving long-term prison sentences. They are all innocent people, never committed any crime in any standard, even under the Chinese constitution.' Raphaël Viana David, program manager of International Service for Human Rights, told VOA, 'There is indisputable evidence that when governments and U.N. experts press Beijing publicly, in a coordinated and sustained fashion, the wall will eventually crack. It is now the moment for global actors to step up pressure in calling out acts of transnational repression by Beijing, and to call for the release of Dr. Abbas.' Mahmut said, 'I believe the EU and countries, especially democratic countries like the U.K., should impose sanctions against China for illegally detaining millions of people, putting people on forced labor. This is not a new thing anymore. It's not news anymore. 'There are so many other things that the EU and the U.K. government can do to really show their support to the Uyghurs and the Tibetans and the Hong Kongers. We are suffering under this regime for too long,' she added. Michael Polak, an international criminal lawyer from London's Church Court Chambers who is involved in a universal jurisdiction case concerning Uyghurs in Argentina, said, 'Five hundred and forty out of 610 members of the European Parliament voted to recognize the repression of the Uyghur people and particularly the continued detention of well-known individual Uyghur leaders.' He emphasized the legal implications of the vote and said, 'This is the biggest Parliament in the world, as far as I'm concerned, to recognize what's happening to the Uyghur people, which are crimes against humanity and genocide.' David said, 'In the last June session of the Human Rights Council, the high commissioner [the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights] also called out a ‘pattern emerging of transnational repression’ in Southeast Asia ‘whereby human rights defenders seeking refuge in neighboring countries have been subject to rendition and refoulement or disappeared and even killed,’ making implicit reference to the unlawful refoulement of lawyer Lu Siwei from Laos to China. Just today, we received reports that Lu Siwei has been arrested: Governments have to firmly condemn this and urge his release.' Rushan Abbas said, 'I urge each EU member state to not only support this resolution but to actively enforce sanctions against Chinese officials and entities directly responsible for the detention and persecution of Uyghurs. ... It is crucial that these sanctions are robust and targeted towards CCP [Chinese Communist Party] officials that aid and abet human rights abuses. 'EU member states should enforce strict compliance with the new EU forced labor regulations. Companies operating within their borders must be transparent about their supply chains and ensure they are not complicit in the exploitation of the Uyghur people,' she added. The human rights situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been the focus of international attention in recent years. Several Western countries and human rights groups have accused China of setting up 're-education camps' in Xinjiang and mass detaining Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. Human Rights Watch reports that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs may have been held in so-called 're-education camps' since 2017. Analysis of satellite imagery from the Australia Strategic Policy Institute shows many suspected detention facilities in Xinjiang. However, the Chinese government firmly denies those allegations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson has repeatedly said that Xinjiang's measures are aimed at combating terrorism and extremism and ensuring regional security and development. The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the European Parliament’s decision. The Chinese Mission to the European Union did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.

Undersea cables emerge as source of friction in South China Sea	WASHINGTON — A new source of tension in the South China Sea — until now focused on fisheries, resource extraction and freedom of navigation — is beginning to get attention: the undersea fiber-optic cables that crisscross the strategic waterway and carry almost all of the region's internet and other telecommunications traffic. Since 2020, according to published reports, the United States has been urging countries in the region to avoid using a Chinese company to repair or lay new cables at the bottom of the sea out of concern that China could intercept and monitor sensitive communications passing through the cables. It has also been urging companies to route new cables around the perimeter of the sea, avoiding the central part of the waterway claimed by China based on historic maps showing a 10-dash line that infringes on the exclusive economic zones of several other countries. In what may be an act of retaliation, according to a Washington Post report this month, China has been delaying — sometimes for months — its approval of permits for companies to repair or lay new cables under the sea. The delays have been particularly troublesome for countries such as Vietnam, which is anxious to replace five aging cables that have failed repeatedly, slowing internet traffic in the country. In the past four years, the U.S. government has blocked at least three cable projects that would have linked the United States to Hong Kong because of concerns that China could spy on or sabotage communications, the Post reported. Concerns were also raised at last month's U.N. General Assembly meetings, where the U.S. and other countries, including Australia, France, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the U.K., issued a joint statement calling for undersea cables to be kept secure from risks that included surveillance, intentional damage and compromise of data and communications. 'There is a risk of surveillance and snooping in by the Chinese telecom companies, and similar kind of surveillance risk exists also for undersea cables,' said Sameer Patil, director of the Center for Security Strategy and Technology at the Observer Foundation. The kind of data that the Chinese military could gather in real time through undersea cables includes information about U.S. military personnel, the movement of U.S. naval warships and other military assets, Patil told VOA. Although the U.S. and some other countries have undersea cables that are exclusive for military use, countries in the Indo-Pacific do not have the financial means to maintain dual sets of cables, said Patil, who is based in New Delhi and has been closely following the issue. This means these countries may transmit sensitive military data and civilian data over the same sets of cables, he said. At the center of the concerns is China's HMN Technologies, the latest entrant into the specialized field of cable laying that previously was dominated by just three companies: U.S.-based SubCom, French firm Alcatel Submarine Networks and Japan's Nippon Electric Company. HMN Technologies was once owned by Huawei and is still considered by the U.S. to be an affiliate of the Chinese tech giant, whose equipment has been banned in the United States and other countries over fears that it can be used to facilitate Chinese espionage. Reuters news agency reported exclusively last month that the United States is pressing Vietnam to avoid using HMN Technologies in its plans to build 10 new undersea cables by 2030. It said U.S. officials and companies have held at least a half-dozen meetings with Vietnamese and foreign officials and business executives on the matter this year. Reuters also quoted multiple sources saying U.S. officials have separately shared intelligence about possible sabotage of Vietnam's subsea cables. The Post said concerted U.S. lobbying has led to three other U.S.-financed transpacific cable projects being routed through the coastal waters of Indonesia and the Philippines to avoid Beijing-claimed waters, driving up the costs of the projects. Meanwhile, according to executives at seven cable companies cited by the Post, permits for cable work that were once approved by China in less than 10 days now are taking up to four months and are sometimes rejected with little justification. While China's claim to most of the South China Sea has been rejected by an international tribunal, the companies say they are unwilling to risk working in the area without Beijing's approval. 'What we're seeing is China essentially retaliating by delaying permits that it can grant,' said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. 'The U.S. government is concerned about China listening in on existing cables,' and Beijing is retaliating against the U.S. for trying to dissuade countries from using Chinese companies, Braw told VOA. Beijing rejected that interpretation in response to questions this week from VOA. 'The Chinese government has always welcomed and supported the laying of international submarine cables by other countries and telecommunications companies in waters under China's jurisdiction,' said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. 'Over the years, China has actively promulgated relevant laws and regulations to clarify the rights and obligations of all countries to lay submarine cables in waters under China's jurisdiction' to 'provide a sound legal guarantee for the transit of international submarine cables in waters under China's jurisdiction,' he said. Erin Murphy, a senior fellow for the Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told VOA that China may have its own concerns about espionage or sabotage operations when cable-laying ships from the United States or other Western countries operate in areas it claims as being under its jurisdiction. 'There's also the economic competition angle. Preventing non-Chinese companies from operating in their perceived backyard is one way to continue to dominate the network, providing ongoing business for its companies and fulfill its digital Silk Road ambitions,' she said. Braw at the Atlantic Council said Chinese companies, while relatively new to the field, have become highly competitive with Western cable-laying companies by offering to build and repair subsea cables at cheaper costs. An estimated 400 to 600 fiber-optic cables crisscross the world's seabed with a total length of 1.4 million kilometers, according to TeleGeography, a research firm monitoring the telecommunications industry. That is enough to wrap around the earth's circumference about 35 times. These cables carry more than 95% of global data, including voice communications, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Commerce Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/undersea-cables-emerge-as-source-of-friction-in-south-china-sea/7819426.html	2024-10-11T12:50:51-07:00

UN warns widening Middle East conflict threatens health of millions	GENEVA — United Nations human rights officials warn the widening conflict and military escalation across the Middle East are putting 'the lives and well-being of potentially millions of people across the region at risk' and diminishing prospects for peace. 'I’m having trouble finding the right words today to just describe how terrible this situation has been for civilians' on the ground in Lebanon, Gaza, Israel and Syria, Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Friday. 'This is going to have an impact that will reverberate across many generations of people in the Middle East,' she said. 'Children who have been out of school for so long, children who have had their limbs amputated, who will be living with lifelong injuries, as well as the trauma of the impunity that has marked this conflict, means that it is going to continue to feed cycles of revenge and injustice.' The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, reports more than 2,000 people have been killed and nearly 10,000 injured in fighting in Lebanon over the past year. About one-fifth of those killed were women and children. According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health, at least 22 people were killed and over 100 injured Thursday night when Beirut was bombed 'in the heaviest strike yet on the central part of the city.' Essential civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, ambulances, schools and housing, reportedly have been destroyed or damaged. While the Lebanese people are bearing the brunt of this latest phase of conflict, Hezbollah and other armed groups continue to fire rockets into Israel, resulting in the deaths of two people on Oct. 9, 'the first civilian fatalities in northern Israel since the most recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon last month,' Shamdasani said. 'Amidst this escalating violence, we are appalled by sweeping inflammatory language on multiple sides,' Shamdasani said. 'Recent language threatening Lebanese people as a whole and calling on them to either rise up against Hezbollah or face destruction like Gaza' risks being understood as encouraging violence against civilians and civilian objects, 'in violation of international law,' she said. This was a reference to a threat made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a video address Wednesday. Shamdasani said that 'ongoing denigration of the U.N., in particular UNRWA, is unacceptable. This kind of toxic rhetoric, from any source, must stop.' UNRWA is the U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees. Gaza suffering continues Meanwhile, the suffering of the population in the Gaza Strip goes on. Gaza’s Ministry of Health reports more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them women and children, and 96,600 people have been injured since Israel began its military offensive in the Palestinian enclave a year ago. The offensive was triggered by the surprise Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people; some 250 others were taken hostage. Over the last week, Israel has intensified its military operation in northern Gaza. 'We are greatly concerned about the safety of patients and the health workers amid these intensifying hostilities and the current evacuation orders covering Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals in northern Gaza,' said Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the World Health Organization’s representative to the occupied Palestinian territories, said on a video link from Jerusalem. 'We had three missions planned over the last week' to assist in the transfer of 'critical nonwalking patients from these hospitals,' he said, adding that 'none have been successful.' He said that the mission to Kamal-Adwan hospital was impeded after delays at the checkpoint, and a mission to resupply As-Sahaba hospital with fuel, blood units and medical supplies was denied October 9 and impeded on October 10. 'Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda remain partially functional but are struggling due to shortage of supplies, including blood, trauma disposables and medications for patients with noncommunicable diseases and fuel,' he said, adding that Indonesian Hospital 'is no longer able to provide services and accommodate patients.' Attacks on health care locations The World Health Organization recorded 18 attacks on health care facilities, resulting in 72 deaths and 40 injuries among health staff since Sept. 17. It reported 96 primary health care centers and health facilities were forced to close in the south due to rising hostilities. Five hospitals were reported nonfunctional 'due to physical or infrastructural damage, and four hospitals were partially evacuated, requiring the transfer of patients,' the WHO said. Amid this chaos, confusion and multiple challenges, UNICEF and WHO officials said, the second round of emergency polio vaccinations is scheduled to go ahead Monday in Gaza. The first round, held Sept. 1-12, successfully vaccinated an estimated 591,700 children against the crippling disease. As in the first round, the second round will have three phases, each involving three campaign days and one catch-up day in the central, the south and the north of the Gaza Strip. 'Local teams will be deployed in areas that need special coordination to reach children, including those who could not receive vaccines in the first round. It is critical they are reached,' Peeperkorn said. Speaking from Jerusalem, Jean Gough, UNICEF special representative, said one of the challenges facing vaccinators is the 'endless population movements.' 'Once again, it will be absolutely critical that not only the localized humanitarian pauses are respected in the north, but also that people are not forced to move from one area to the other,' she said. 'This will be essential for us to be able to vaccinate at least 90% of children under the age of 10 among the population in the north. We have reassurance from COGAT that these humanitarian pauses will take place.' She said U.N. agencies overseeing the campaign will be meeting every day with COGAT, an Israeli unit that is responsible for implementing Israel’s civilian and humanitarian policies in the Palestinian territories. 'So, we are confident that the humanitarian pause will continue' throughout the campaign, Gough said. 'It worked for round one, and we are confident that it will work for round two.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-warns-widening-middle-east-conflict-threatens-health-of-millions/7819309.html	2024-10-11T11:20:22-07:00	
Hurricane Milton leaves at least 16 dead, millions without power		https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-milton-leaves-at-least-16-dead-millions-without-power/7819303.html	2024-10-11T11:18:04-07:00	
Back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch	WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year's U.S. presidential election. The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort. The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties. Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration's competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior. Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should address the situation immediately. Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue, said, 'Dealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election. 'Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than normal,' Kneeland said. Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes. Campaign language altered The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates' campaign events as well. On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the people in Milton's path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters. Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election. 'I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,' she said. On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration. 'They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,' he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina. Voting systems affected The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help people in the state's affected counties vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn't need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene. Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are 'un-American.' Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need. 'Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate,' she said. 'This does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.' As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations. On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration's efforts. At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign policies to stop price gouging on food and other products. 'To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will be held accountable,' she said. Harris warned that Milton 'poses extreme danger.' It made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roads. Misinformation about Helene Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration's response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants. The former president said the administration's response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration's widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths. 'This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them stranded,' Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. 'This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right?' Asked about the Trump campaign's strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of 'failed leadership' by the Biden administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border. John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need. 'These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,' he said. But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden administration might not matter that much on Election Day.	https://www.voanews.com/a/back-to-back-hurricanes-reshape-2024-campaign-s-final-stretch/7819253.html	2024-10-11T10:45:24-07:00

US lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&T, Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among the telecoms whose networks were breached. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and detailed answers by next Friday. 'There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks,' the lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. AT&T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not immediately comment. It was unclear when the hack occurred. Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had 'concocted a false narrative' to 'frame' China in the past.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-answers-from-telecoms-on-chinese-hacking-report-/7819230.html	2024-10-11T10:09:58-07:00	
Mozambique extends voting in some districts and for German diaspora	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique's electoral body extended voting until Saturday in some areas and in one overseas location because material didn't arrive on time. Most of the country completed voting Wednesday and now awaits results. National Electoral Commission spokesperson Paulo Cuinica told reporters on Friday that voting did not take place in some districts of Zambezia province, in central Mozambique, partly due to problems getting voting materials in time. 'As a result of this fact, 23 polling stations did not open in the province of Zambezia, [or in the coastal circle of Zambezia], with 4 in Maganja da Costa and 19 in the district of Gilé,' Cuinica said. Voting outside the country also had hiccups, he said, noting that 670 Mozambicans living in Germany in were unable to vote. He said voting materials were shipped to Germany on September 27th, but were held up in Cologne and did not reach Berlin until Thursday, the day after the election. As a result, Cuinica said voting is being extended in affected areas. He said voters can cast ballots from 7 am to 6 pm Saturday in the districts of Gilé and Maganja, and from 9 am to 9 pm in Germany. Meanwhile, election monitors in Mozambique gave preliminary assessments of the process. Laura Valerin, a member of parliament from Spain and chief observer of the European Union election mission, told VOA monitors observed about 800 polling stations. While she praised the peaceful campaign and orderly voting, she said there were issues. 'We saw the counting phase,' she said. 'Our observers saw the processes were in many times very long, really slow with some difficulties foreseen by polling staff, with some doubts about how the process had to take place.' She said that before election day, the EU team's engagement with political parties, media and civil society indicated that there is widespread mistrust about the independence of the electoral bodies. Succès Masra, a former prime minister of Chad and head of the observer mission for the U.S.-based International Republican Institute, said his organization had teams from 20 countries, including 12 in sub–Saharan Africa, deployed across Mozambique. Masra praised the democratic spirit of Mozambicans but said his teams had reservations about the electoral process. 'Citizens were not deterred from exercising their right to determine their future,' he said. 'Our observations show delayed accreditation for observers and party agents, late changes to electoral laws and the misuse of state resources during the campaign. These issues raised concerns about public confidence in the process and independence of institutions.' Masra said he hopes that Mozambicans can address the issues to strengthen their democratic institutions. Now Mozambique awaits the results from this, the country's seventh general elections since the advent of multiparty democracy 30 years ago. The first official results from the National Electoral Council could come as early as Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-extends-voting-in-some-districts-and-overseas-locations/7819236.html	2024-10-11T10:09:18-07:00	
FIFA urged to put more human rights scrutiny into 2034 World Cup deal with Saudi Arabia	zurich — Two months before FIFA is set to confirm Saudi Arabia as the 2034 World Cup host, the soccer body was urged again Friday to allow independent scrutiny of the kingdom's human rights obligations for the tournament. A group of law and human rights experts plus Saudi activists abroad want FIFA to mandate ongoing reviews — and a potential termination clause — into the 2034 World Cup hosting contract. The advisers who came to Zurich on Friday want FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who is closely tied to Saudi political and soccer leaders, to learn from how Qatar was picked to host the 2022 World Cup. Qatar won in 2010 with little thought from FIFA's then-leaders about legal safeguards and reputational challenges. Saudi Arabia, like Qatar, is a traditionally conservative society and needs a huge construction project relying on migrant workers to build stadiums and other infrastructure for global soccer's biggest event. 'There are really no excuses now,' British lawyer Rodney Dixon told The Associated Press. 'If it means that they therefore have to come to a different kind of agreement in December, that is what they should do.' World Cup hosting contracts will be signed after the Dec. 11 decision by more than 200 FIFA member federations at an online meeting. Saudi Arabia is the only candidate for 2034. Promising not to be confrontational with FIFA, Dixon said: 'We are not naive. It is not FIFA's role to change the world. They are not the UN.' The briefing in FIFA's home city came two days after the UN General Assembly in New York rejected a Saudi bid to get a seat on the 47-nation Human Rights Council for the next three years. On Friday, the would-be FIFA advisers cited Saudi Arabia's record on freedom of speech and assembly, and laws on labor and male guardianship that limit women's freedoms. After Infantino was first elected in 2016, when scrutiny was intense on Qatar and its treatment of migrant workers, FIFA demanded a human rights strategy from future World Cup hosts. Bid rules for the 2030 and 2034 men's tournaments refer to 'activities in connection with the bidding for and hosting' rather than rights in wider society. In May, FIFA got an offer from the law and human rights experts to create an independent process for monitoring progress in Saudi Arabia. Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, an anti-corruption advisor to FIFA from 2011-14, said they had been ignored and 'we are here in Zurich to try again.' In July, Saudi plans for the World Cup were published including a review of its human rights strategy by lawyers it chose, and 15 stadium projects. Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea said Friday it documented 'grave labor violations' against migrant workers who number more than 13 million, or about 40% of the kingdom's population. The scale of construction required for the World Cup and potential for labor abuses 'is really, really chilling,' Shea said in a live link from London. She cautioned that while rights groups had limited access to operate in Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup, there is 'zero access' to Saudi Arabia. Saudi soccer officials have consistently said the kingdom is making progress on social reforms as part of the Vision 2030 drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernize and create a post-oil economy. The 2034 bid campaign was contacted for comment Friday. In a video message from Washington D.C., Abdullah Alaoudh of the Middle East Democracy Center insisted 'the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia has worsened under Mohamed bin Salman's leadership.' Saudi Arabia was ranked No. 131 of 146 nations on gender issues by the World Economic Forum, Dixon noted. '[There are] so many laws that prejudice women,' he said. 'None of them are addressed by the Saudi bid.' FIFA is evaluating World Cup bidders with reports likely in early December. It also must assess the human rights strategy of the sole candidate for the 2030 World Cup: co-hosts Spain, Portugal and Morocco with single games in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. FIFA and Infantino have not held a news conference to take any questions on World Cup bids since the 2034 edition was fast-tracked toward Saudi Arabia one year ago. Any protest among FIFA voters on Dec. 11 has been made less likely because of how the organization is structuring the voting. FIFA said last week both 2030 and 2034 awards will be combined in a single vote. Any European opposition to the Saudi bid also would count against Spain and Portugal. Victory by acclamation without an itemized vote is possible.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fifa-urged-to-put-more-human-rights-scrutiny-into-2034-world-cup-deal-with-saudi-arabia-/7819168.html	2024-10-11T09:40:32-07:00

Partial remains of British climber believed found 100 years after Everest ascent	LONDON — Climbers believe they have found the partial remains of a British mountaineer who might — or might not — have been one of the first two people to climb Mount Everest, a century after their attempt on the world's highest peak, according to an expedition led by National Geographic. Ahead of the release of a documentary film, the television channel said Friday that the expedition found a foot encased in a sock embroidered with 'AC Irvine' and a boot that could be that of Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine, who disappeared at the age of 22 along with his co-climber, the legendary George Mallory, near Everest's peak on June 8, 1924. The pair, who were seeking to become the first people to conquer Everest, were last seen around 800 feet (245 meters) from the summit. Their fate has been debated by climbers and historians alike, with some postulating that they had stood atop of the world before disappearing on the way down. In his final letter to his wife, Ruth, before he vanished on Mount Everest a century ago, the 37-year-old Mallory, who once famously said he wanted to conquer Everest 'because it's there,' tried to ease her worries even as he said his chances of reaching the world's highest peak were '50 to 1 against us.' Mallory's body was found in 1999 but there was no evidence that could point to the two having reached Everest's summit at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). There is still no such evidence, though the apparent discovery of Irvine's remains could narrow the search for a Kodak Vest Pocket camera lent to the climbers by expedition member Howard Somervell. For mountaineers, it's the equivalent of the Holy Grail — the possibility of photographic proof that the two did reach the summit, almost three decades before New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay got there on May, 29, 1953. The sock and boot were found at a lower altitude than Mallory's remains, on the Central Rongbuk Glacier below the North Face of Mount Everest. 'This was a monumental and emotional moment for us and our entire team on the ground, and we just hope this can finally bring peace of mind to his relatives and the climbing world at large,' said climb team member and National Geographic explorer Jimmy Chin. Chin did not say exactly where the remains were found because he wants to discourage trophy hunters. But he's confident that other items — and maybe even the camera — are nearby. 'It certainly reduces the search area,' he told National Geographic. The Irvine family has volunteered to compare DNA test results with the remains to confirm his identity. His great-niece and biographer, Julie Summers, said she reacted emotionally when she found out about the discovery. 'I have lived with this story since I was a 7-year-old when my father told us about the mystery of Uncle Sandy on Everest,' she said. 'When Jimmy told me that he saw the name AC Irvine on the label on the sock inside the boot, I found myself moved to tears. It was and will remain an extraordinary and poignant moment.' The find, made by Chin along with climbers and filmmakers Erich Roepke and Mark Fisher, was reported to the London-based Royal Geographical Society, which jointly organized Mallory and Irvine's expedition along with the Alpine Club. 'As joint organizer of the 1924 Everest expedition, the society deeply appreciates the respect Jimmy Chin's team has shown Sandy Irvine's remains and their sensitivity toward Sandy's family members and others connected to that expedition,' said Joe Smith, director of the society. The partial remains are now in the possession of the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, which is responsible for climbing permits on Everest's northern side.	https://www.voanews.com/a/partial-remains-of-british-climber-believed-found-100-years-after-everest-ascent-/7819145.html	2024-10-11T09:19:41-07:00	
Myanmar crisis dominates ASEAN talks as consensus plan languishes	VIENTIANE, LAOS — Myanmar’s worsening violence took center stage at this week’s Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Vientiane, Laos, as regional leaders grappled with the inability to implement their Five-Point Consensus. This outline for peace agreed upon nearly four years ago, calls for an end to the violence in the country, constructive dialogue among the parties, humanitarian aid and appointment of a special envoy from each ASEAN country to facilitate peace talks. The Myanmar junta’s noncompliance is widely blamed for the slow progress since the drafting of the consensus in early 2021 in Jakarta, Indonesia, frustrating ASEAN leaders. This year, for the first time since being barred for noncompliance in late 2021, a senior official from Myanmar’s Foreign Affairs Ministry was allowed to attend the summit, including a two-day retreat attended by the foreign ministers of the nine other ASEAN countries. This development followed Laos' behind-the-scenes negotiations between its special envoy and the Myanmar junta, a senior ASEAN diplomat told VOA. 'Laos, as the rotating chairman, negotiated with the junta, which allowed Myanmar’s representative to attend,' the diplomat said. It remains uncertain if this will lead to meaningful progress on the crisis. The last junta representative to attend an ASEAN meeting was its leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Days after agreeing to the consensus, he characterized it as 'suggestions by ASEAN leaders' that it would consider 'when the situation returns to stability.' An ASEAN diplomat who attended the summit confirmed to VOA that Myanmar's representative, Permanent Secretary Aung Kyaw Moe, did not speak during the summit meetings. However, at the ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting before the summit, he expressed Myanmar’s appreciation for ASEAN’s efforts and urged caution in the language used when discussing Myanmar-related issues. Diverse ASEAN approaches emerge Thailand reiterated its long-standing stance that any resolution to the Myanmar crisis must come from within the country itself. 'Thailand remains committed to facilitating internal consultations. Any solution must be Myanmar-led and Myanmar-owned,' Nikorndej Balankura, a spokesperson for Thailand's Foreign Ministry, told VOA. 'Thailand,' he said, 'has always shown its readiness to assist when needed. We have consistently emphasized that solutions should come from within Myanmar, and we encourage that approach. That's why we've provided a platform for internal consultations [in ASEAN]. Some refer to it as the 'Troika Plus,' which includes the past, present and future ASEAN chairs — Indonesia, Laos and Malaysia — along with other ASEAN member countries involved in the peace process. Ultimately, it's about facilitating dialogue, which will take place in Thailand.' Indonesian Vice President Ma’ruf Amin emphasized the importance of upholding international law. 'The crisis not only brings suffering to the people of Myanmar, but it also poses a threat to regional stability,' he said. Amin reaffirmed ASEAN’s commitment to the Five-Point Consensus while calling for increased humanitarian assistance. He also highlighted the need to resolve the Rohingya issue as part of addressing the broader Myanmar crisis. Indonesia has seen an influx of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar since 2017, many of whom have died attempting the treacherous journey by sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed frustration about the lack of progress in addressing the Myanmar crisis. 'We are firmly behind the ASEAN proposal of the Five-Point Consensus,' he told reporters outside the meeting room. 'But we have not been very successful in actually changing the situation. We are trying to formulate new strategies, and that’s what we will be discussing.' Summit’s regional dynamics The summit saw participation from many ASEAN country leaders, including the sultan of Brunei and the prime ministers of Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Despite efforts by this year’s chair, Laos, to engage Myanmar in the talks, no clear solution to the crisis has emerged. Myanmar remains a daunting challenge to the region’s stability. Myanmar’s presence at the summit, although controversial, is seen as progress by some. Countries such as Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have long advocated for its inclusion in the meetings as a practical matter to make Myanmar 'more presentable' as a member of ASEAN and to facilitate humanitarian aid entering the country. 'In a sense, they are accepting the Five-Point Consensus. They may have thought that it's better to have their own voice heard rather than be on the outside,' one diplomat told Agence France-Presse. Myanmar’s representative, Aung Kyaw Moe, however, remained silent, refusing to answer reporters' questions. Inadequate implementation Many Southeast Asian leaders have criticized Myanmar’s implementation of the Five-Point Consensus as 'substantially inadequate.' The junta has continued its violent crackdown on dissent and has been accused of widespread atrocities, including bombing of civilians, torture of political prisoners and journalists, and even genocide. Malaysia’s incoming ASEAN chair, Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan, underscored that 'we have to approach everybody in Myanmar,' signaling a possible shift toward broader dialogue as the bloc seeks to resolve the conflict. Assuming the helm of ASEAN next year, Malysia faces a daunting set of challenges, including a rise in transnational crime, growing food instability and humanitarian crises in the region, largely because of the conflict in Myanmar. An ASEAN diplomat, who requested anonymity and attended the ASEAN-China Summit, told VOA, 'In general terms, some ASEAN member countries reiterated their support for the Five-Point Consensus and urged China to play a role in working with ASEAN to find a solution, given China's influence as a neighboring country. However, there were no specific details provided regarding China's involvement.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-crisis-dominates-asean-talks-as-consensus-plan-languishes/7819127.html	2024-10-11T09:13:44-07:00

Trade plummets along Nigeria-Cameroon southern border after new ban	Yaounde, Cameroon — Trade and maritime traffic between Cameroon and Nigeria nosedived this week after a Cameroonian state governor ordered a temporary trade ban Wednesday in the Bakassi Peninsula, in response to the abduction of two officials from the area. Cameroon reports about 35 percent of Nigerian petroleum products and basic commodities imported by Cameroon pass through the peninsula. Nigeria also depends on Bakassi for most of its cocoa and fish imports from Cameroon. Aboko Patrick, mayor of Kombo Abedimo, a locality in Bakassi, told VOA that several thousand merchants have been unable to transport their goods out of the area since the ban. 'All petroleum products come from Nigeria, even food items come from Nigeria,' he said. 'The fish which is caught in our territorial waters is carried to Nigeria. Today those fishermen, those who were doing legal business, are bound to suffer, but if this suffering can lead us to have peace, I think it is better that we go for it.' On Wednesday, Bernard Okalia Bilai, governor of Cameroon's Southwest Region, ordered the suspension of trade and maritime activity with Nigeria in the peninsula because suspected gunmen from Nigeria allegedly abducted Roland Ewane, the division officer (D.O.) of the Idabato district. 'It is well established that the D.O was kidnapped with the complicity of the population of Idabato who are 95% Nigerians who refuse to pay taxes,' Bilai said, adding, 'and once the D.O. want(ed) to fight illegal activities and to request the payment of taxes, he (was) attacked, kidnapped and carried to Nigeria. It is well established that he is now in Nigerian territory. They should release the D.O.' Ewane was abducted alongside Ismael Etongo, an Idabato district council staff member, and taken to Nigeria in a speedboat, Bilai said. Nigeria ceded control of Bakassi to Cameroon in the early 2000s, after a long legal battle in international courts. However, Cameroon has complained that most of the area’s 300,000 inhabitants, most of whom are Nigerians, refuse to pay taxes. Merchants say Cameroon has deployed troops to enforce tax payments, something that Cameroon officials deny. Cameroon says it has written to Nigerian authorities to help secure the release of the two abducted officials. Joseph Vincent Ntuda Ebode, an expert on international security at the University of Yaounde-Soa, told VOA by telephone that it would be helpful if merchants paid taxes to the Cameroonian government. It is a civic duty for all civilians to pay their taxes, he said, adding that Bakassi needs schools, hospitals, markets and lots of other infrastructure that can be developed with the money. The trade ban appears to be having an impact, as Nigerian merchants say they have not received goods from Bakassi for the past two days. Nigeria has not commented on the abductions or the ban on trade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trade-plummets-along-nigeria-cameroon-southern-border-after-new-ban-/7819057.html	2024-10-11T08:58:30-07:00

North Korea accuses South of drone leaflet drops, Seoul denies	Seoul, South Korea — North Korea on Friday accused South Korea of sending drones to drop anti-regime leaflets over Pyongyang, an accusation that Seoul immediately denied. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's foreign ministry said South Korean drones have entered Pyongyang at night on three occasions since October 3, scattering 'numerous' leaflets. The ministry called the alleged incursion a 'grave political and military provocation' that requires retaliation, warning that the situation could lead to an armed conflict or even war. South Korea’s military denied involvement, stating it did not send any drones but that it would investigate whether private groups may have launched the leaflets, reported the South’s Yonhap news agency. In recent months, North Korea has launched thousands of trash-filled balloons into South Korea as retaliation against activists who float anti-Pyongyang leaflets northward across the border. While South Korean activists have recently employed more advanced types of balloons to send leaflets into North Korea, there are no known reports of them using drones. The leaflets often criticize North Korea's human rights abuses or mock its leader Kim Jong Un and are sometimes accompanied by valuable items like dollar bills or USB drives. North Korea is governed by a third-generation hereditary dictatorship that views virtually all outside information as an existential threat. In the past, North Korea has used the leaflets as a justification to ramp up cross-border tensions. When the North began sending waste-filled balloons to the South in May, some analysts cautioned that Kim may be preparing to conduct a more serious cross-border confrontation. In one particularly provocative move, North Korea in late 2022 sent five small reconnaissance drones across the border, with one making it all the way to the northern edge of the capital, Seoul. In response, South Korea’s military said it sent a drone into North Korea on a reconnaissance mission. There have been no subsequent reports that South Korea’s military has flown drones into the North.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-accuses-south-of-drone-leaflet-drops-seoul-denies-/7818942.html	2024-10-11T07:07:22-07:00	
UN mourns ban on Afghan girls’ education on international girl child day	Islamabad — The United Nations expressed 'a great deal of sorrow' Friday over the continued ban on girls’ secondary school education in Taliban-led Afghanistan as the world body marked the International Day of the Girl Child. Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, renewed her appeal to Taliban leaders to 'change course' by lifting the restrictions. She lamented that over 1,100 days have passed since the de facto Afghan authorities imposed the ban on educating girls over the age of 12. 'This is more than three years of lost opportunity – not just for millions of girls, but for families, communities, and the entire country,' Otunbayeva stated. 'As each day passes, even greater damage is being done to the lives of women and girls. Afghanistan is being taken backwards, not forwards, in its quest for peace, recovery, and prosperity,' the U.N. envoy added. Otunbayeva pledged that her organization will continue to advocate for Afghan women and girls, even in the face of attempts to silence them. The Taliban have enforced their strict interpretation of Islamic law since regaining control of the impoverished country in 2021. Girls ages 12 and older are barred from attending school, making Afghanistan the only country with that restriction. Female students have been prohibited from attending universities, and most Afghan women are banned from working in both public and private sectors, including the U.N. They are also forbidden from visiting public places such as parks and gyms. Islamist leaders enacted contentious 'vice and virtue' laws last month, which solidified existing restrictions on women’s freedoms and deemed the sound of a female’s voice in public as a moral violation. The decree requires women to cover their entire bodies and faces when outdoors and forbids them from looking at men to whom they are not related and vice versa, sparking a global outcry and calls for reversing the curbs. The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any country, defends its policies as being aligned with Sharia and Afghan customs, rejecting international criticism as an interference in the internal affairs of the country. The United Nations recognizes October 11 as the International Day of the Girl Child to acknowledge girls' rights and the challenges they face worldwide.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-mourns-ban-on-afghan-girls-education-on-international-girl-child-day/7818949.html	2024-10-11T07:07:04-07:00	
Taiwan says 4 Foxconn workers detained in China	Taipei, Taiwan — Four people working for Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn in China have been detained, Taipei said Friday, describing the circumstances as 'quite strange'. The employees were detained by public security in the central city of Zhengzhou for the equivalent of 'breach of trust' under Taiwan law, Taipei's top China policy body, the Mainland Affairs Council, said in a statement to AFP. 'The circumstances surrounding this case are quite strange,' the council said. Foxconn 'has declared the company suffered no losses, and the four employees did not harm the company's interests in any way,' it said, without providing details about when they were detained or their roles. Foxconn, also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer and assembles devices for major tech companies, including Apple. Most of its factories are in China, including Zhengzhou, which is dubbed 'iPhone City' as the home of the world's biggest factory for the smartphone. The Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body in Taiwan handling people and business exchanges with China, told AFP the four detainees were Taiwanese. The case 'may involve corruption and abuse of power by a small number of public security officials, which has severely damaged business confidence,' the Mainland Affairs Council said. 'We urge the relevant authorities across the strait to investigate and address the matter promptly.' A Foxconn spokesman declined to comment when contacted by AFP. China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said she was 'not aware of the specific situation'. China and Taiwan have been locked in a decades-long dispute, with Beijing claiming the self-ruled island as part of its territory, which the Taipei government rejects. Many Taiwanese companies set up factories in China over the past four decades, taking advantage of the shared language and cheaper operating costs, but investment has fallen sharply in recent years over regional tech disputes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-4-foxconn-workers-detained-in-china-/7818843.html	2024-10-11T05:43:05-07:00	
Blinken warns China against provocations toward Taiwan	VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Friday warned China against military provocations toward Taiwan, following Beijing's strong reaction to an annual speech by the leader of the self-ruled democracy. 'I can tell you that with regard to the so-called Ten Ten speech, which is a regular exercise, China should not use it in any fashion as a pretext for provocative actions,' Blinken told reporters during a press conference in Vientiane, Laos. He was referring to October 10, known as Double Ten Day, when Taiwan celebrates the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911. The People's Republic of China celebrates its national day on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. China has continued to ramp up its military threats against Taiwan, following President Lai Ching-te's Thursday speech, which rejected China’s claim of sovereignty over the island. Blinken was in Vientiane for meetings with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and participated in the East Asia Summit. He said there is a strong desire among all ASEAN countries, along with others present, to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, with neither side taking actions that undermine the status quo. Earlier on Friday, Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military aircraft and 10 naval vessels around Taiwan. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan’s northern and southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone, according to a posting on social media platform X by Taiwan’s defense ministry. Between Wednesday and Thursday, Taiwan also detected 27 Chinese military aircraft, nine naval vessels, and five official ships. In Beijing, Chinese officials said Taiwan 'has no so-called sovereignty.' Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, slammed Lai, accusing him of having 'the ill intention of heightening tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his selfish political interest.' Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island. Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing to counter the then-Soviet Union in 1979. Since then, relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in April 1979, under which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan. In September, Taiwan President Lai said if China’s claims over Taiwan are truly based on concerns about territorial integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the 600,000 square kilometers of land it ceded to Russia in the 19th century — an area almost the size of Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-warns-china-against-provocations-toward-taiwan/7818840.html	2024-10-11T05:22:49-07:00	
Noel Tata takes the reins at powerful charity arm of India's Tata group	NEW DELHI — The half-brother of Ratan Tata was appointed on Friday as the head of the powerful and influential philanthropic arm of India's Tata group, giving him indirect control of the $165 billion conglomerate. Tata Trusts said Noel Tata, 67, will be its new chairman after the death this week of Ratan Tata, one of India's best-known corporate titans. The decision followed 'many old-timers' in the group wanting him to lead the venture, said one Tata executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The parent company, Tata Sons, oversees 30 firms across consumer goods, hotels, automobiles and airlines and has become a global juggernaut over the years, with brands such as Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea in its stable. It owns Tata Consultancy Services, Taj Hotels and Air India and counts Starbucks SBUX.O and Airbus as partners in India. Tata Trusts has a 66% ownership of Tata Sons, giving it power over big investment, philanthropic and strategic decisions by the conglomerate, company executives say. Noel Tata, who is half-French, was already among the many trustees of the philanthropic arm, and also chairman of Tata's retail fashion brand Trent as well as vice chairman of Tata Steel TISC.NS. The trust earns dividends from Tata Sons but has no direct say over its operations. However, it appoints a third of the directors to Tata Sons who have veto power over board decisions. The chairman of Tata Trusts 'is powerful enough to decide board and key personnel' appointments at Tata Sons, a second senior company executive said. While Tata Sons is not compelled to seek advice or guidance from the philanthropic arm, it's an 'unsaid understanding' that there is consultation between leadership on both sides, the first executive added. Noel’s journey The Tata group was set up in 1868 by Ratan's great grandfather, Jamsetji Tata. A few years later, Jamsetji started charity work that has since expanded to sectors such as healthcare and sports, through many of the trusts in the philanthropic arm. Ratan Tata started working at the family firm in 1962 and became the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, taking the group to new heights while gaining a reputation as an extremely shy, soft-spoken executive with sharp business acumen. Noel Tata is a graduate of Sussex University who has been associated with the group for more than 40 years. He serves on the board of various Tata companies. As a previous managing director of Tata International, Noel grew the turnover of the trading arm to more than $3 billion from $500 million, a Tata Group website said. The Tatas belong to the tiny Parsi community, which has included some of India's biggest business names, top nuclear scientists, world-class musicians and senior military officers. Parsis follow the Zoroastrian faith, an ancient pre-Islamic religion of Iran. Some of its tenets, such as charity and doing good to others, have long been woven into the Tata heritage and business ethos. Much of the dividend paid out by Tata Sons gets funneled into charitable trusts involved in philanthropic work. Although the trusts' influence over the group is not often on display, the starkest such example was in 2016, when Ratan Tata had a falling out with Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry that led to the latter's ouster. Mistry, another Parsi billionaire whose family owns a stake of about 18% in Tata Sons, died in a car accident in 2022. One of his former advisers told Reuters this week that the Tata Trusts 'without a doubt' exert unparalleled power over Tata Sons' functions, adding that they 'work behind a veil.' Noel is an Irish citizen married to Mistry's sister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/noel-tata-takes-the-reins-at-powerful-charity-arm-of-india-s-tata-group-/7818805.html	2024-10-11T04:44:34-07:00	
Who are Japan's Nobel Peace Prize winners Nihon Hidankyo?	STOCKHOLM — Japanese organization Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki who are also known as Hibakusha, won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Below are some facts about the background and efforts of the movement. Atomic bombing of Japan In 1945 the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to bring an end to World War II and avoid a hugely costly invasion of the Japanese home islands. The two bombs killed an estimated 120,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, while many thousands more died of burns and radiation injuries in the following years. The two atomic bombs remain the only nuclear weapons used in war. Local associations The fates of those who survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were long concealed and neglected, especially in the initial years after the end of the war. Local Hibakusha associations, along with victims of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific, formed the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations in 1956. The organisation, whose name was shortened in Japanese to Nihon Hidankyo, would become the largest and most influential Hibakusha organisation in Japan. Witness accounts Through the years, Nihon Hidankyo has provided thousands of witness accounts relating the experience of the nuclear bombs. It has issued resolutions and public appeals, and sent annual delegations to bodies such as the United Nations and peace conferences to advocate nuclear disarmament. The movement has helped drive global opposition to nuclear weapons through the force of the survivors' testimonies while also creating educational campaigns and issuing stark warnings about the spread and use of nuclear arms. Future With each passing year, the number of survivors from the two nuclear blasts in Japan nearly 80 years ago grows smaller. But the grassroots movement has played a part creating a culture of remembrance, allowing for new generations of Japanese to carry on the work.

Russian strikes on Ukraine's Odesa region kill 4, governor says	kyiv, Ukraine — A Russian missile slammed into a commercial building in Ukraine's southern Odesa region overnight, killing four people including a 16-year-old girl, regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Friday. It was the fourth Russian attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa and the nearby region in the last five days. Kiper said a day of mourning had been announced for Friday in the region to remember people killed in a Russian drone attack on October 9. 'In two days Russian terrorists killed 13 civilian people in the Odesa region and most of them are youth,' Kiper said on the Telegram messaging app. The ability to maintain exports through the Black Sea ports is vital for the Ukrainian economy which has been hit hard by Russia's war in Ukraine. The Prosecutor General's office said Russian forces had struck civilian infrastructure with a ballistic Iskander missile at about 22:35 (19:35 GMT) on Thursday night. A two-story commercial building hosting food production facilities where civilians worked was hit and 10 more people were wounded, officials said. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said the Russian attacks targeted civilian infrastructure and strived to create impossible living conditions for millions of Ukrainians. The Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 29 out of 66 Russian drones launched at Ukraine overnight. Moscow also fired two missiles, it said, and 31 drones were 'locationally lost,' an apparent reference to electronic warfare, while two drones returned towards Russian territory. Zelenskyy meets foreign leaders The new wave of strikes on Ukrainian Black Sea ports has coincided with visits by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week to meet leaders in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin to discuss his proposed 'victory plan.' There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the strike on Odesa. Russia, which invaded in February 2022, denies targeting civilians. It says it targets only military infrastructure and other military targets although towns and cities across Ukraine have been struck repeatedly. A Russian missile hit a Palau-flagged vessel in Odesa port Monday, while on Sunday, another Russian missile damaged a civilian Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged vessel loaded with corn in the port of Pivdennyi. Ukrainian officials said Russia had carried out almost 60 attacks on ports over the past three months, resulting in the damage and destruction of almost 300 port infrastructure facilities, 177 vehicles and 22 civilian vessels. 'They are trying from all sides to suppress our intentions to develop, maintain our economy,' Kiper said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strikes-on-ukraine-s-odesa-region-kill-4-governor-says/7818712.html	2024-10-11T02:45:09-07:00

Cameroon bans any talk about 91-year-old president's health	YAOUNDE, cameroon — Cameroon has outlawed any discussion about the health of 91-year-old President Paul Biya, a letter shared by the interior ministry said, after Biya's prolonged absence fueled widespread speculation he was unwell. Earlier this week, the authorities put out statements saying the president was on a private visit to Geneva and in good health, dismissing reports he had fallen ill as 'pure fantasy.' In the letter to regional governors dated October 9, Interior Minister Paul Atanga Nji said discussing the president's health was a matter of national security. From now on, 'any debate in the media about the president's condition is therefore strictly prohibited. Offenders will face the full force of the law,' Nji said. He ordered the governors to set up units to monitor broadcasts on private media channels, as well as social networks. Cocoa and oil-producing Cameroon, which has had just two presidents since independence from France and Britain in the early 1960s, is likely to face a messy succession crisis if Biya became too ill to remain in office or died. Cameroon’s media regulator, the National Communication Council, could not immediately be reached for comment. The move faced criticism as an act of state censorship. 'The president is elected by Cameroonians and it's just normal that they worry about his whereabouts,' said Hycenth Chia, a Yaounde-based journalist and talk show host on privately owned television Canal2 International. 'We see liberal discussions on the health of Joe Biden and other world leaders, but here it is a taboo,' he told Reuters. Press freedom advocacy group Committee to Protect Journalists said it was gravely concerned. 'Trying to hide behind national security on such a major issue of national importance is outrageous,' said Angela Quintal, head of the CPJ's Africa Program. Biya has not been seen in public since attending a China-Africa forum in Beijing in early September. His failure to appear as scheduled at a summit in France last weekend further stoked public discussion about his health.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-bans-any-talk-about-91-year-old-president-s-health-/7818693.html	2024-10-11T01:43:42-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy city-hops across Europe, promoting 'victory plan'	ROME — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was city-hopping across Europe on Thursday to promote a 'victory plan' that he said 'aims to create the right conditions for a just end to the war' against Russia, detailing the proposals to European allies after a summit with President Joe Biden was derailed by Hurricane Milton. Zelenskyy's talks in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were quickly followed by another meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron, who just the previous day sent a strong signal of support for Ukraine by visiting Ukrainian troops being trained in France. Zelenskyy posted on X that he 'outlined the details' of the Ukrainian victory plan to Starmer and added: 'We have agreed to work on it together with our allies.' Starmer's Downing Street office said the leaders discussed the blueprint, the challenges for Ukraine of the approaching winter and 'how investment in the country's security today would support Europe's broader security for generations to come.' The Ukrainian leader also met Rutte with Starmer. Zelenskyy posted afterward that they discussed trans-Atlantic cooperation and further reinforcing Ukraine militarily. He gave no details but posted that 'these are the steps that will create the best conditions for restoring a just peace.' Zelenskyy has yet to publicly present his proposals for victory. But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appeared to have the looming U.S. election in mind. Former President Donald Trump has long been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. Zelenskyy had planned to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders in Germany, but it was postponed after Biden stayed home because of the hurricane that struck Florida. Zelenskyy then embarked on his whistle-stop tour of European capitals that have been among Ukraine's staunchest allies outside of the United States. In Paris, Macron and Zelenskyy hugged before talks on the plan at the French presidential Elysee Palace. Afterward, Zelenskyy said 'all the details' would come in November and that he's talking with allies about securing more military aid and permission for Ukrainian forces to carry out long-range strikes. Kyiv wants Western partners to allow strikes deep inside Russia, using long-range weapons they provide. Some, including the U.K. and France, appear willing, but Biden is reticent about escalating the conflict. 'The situation looks bleak for all sides,' Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said Thursday on X. 'The West hesitates amid internal divisions, Ukraine struggles while bracing for a harsh winter, and Russia presses forward without any strategic shifts in its favor, yet grows increasingly impatient.' Later Thursday, Zelenskyy met in Rome with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who ensured Italy's full and continued support 'at both bilateral and multilateral level in order to put Kyiv in the best position possible to build a just and lasting peace.' Meloni said the meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the situation on the ground and Ukraine's 'most immediate military, financial and humanitarian needs, as well as the forthcoming diplomatic initiatives and the pathway to bring an end to the conflict.' She added that Rome will continue to do its part also in the future reconstruction of Ukraine and announced the dates for the next Ukraine recovery conference, which will be held in Rome in July 2025. Zelenskyy stressed that his priority is to strengthen Ukraine's position, with the help of its international partners, to create the necessary conditions for diplomacy. 'Russia is not really looking for a diplomatic path,' he said. 'If we are able to implement the victory plan, Russia won't be able to continue the war.' Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet Pope Francis Friday morning for a half-hour audience, the Vatican said. Later in the day, he'll meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. Ukraine relies heavily on Western support, including tens of billions of dollars' worth of military and financial aid, to keep up the fight against its bigger enemy after almost 1,000 days of fighting since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022. Fearing that crucial help could be in jeopardy due to political changes in donor countries, Ukraine has been building up its domestic arms industry. It also wants to raise more money from taxpayers to pay for the war effort. The Ukrainian parliament passed a bill on second reading Thursday that raises the so-called military tax from 1.5% to 5%. Some amendments are expected before it becomes law. Zelenskyy's tour comes as Russia continues a slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and targets key infrastructure with airstrikes. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the victory plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine 'both geopolitically and on the battlefield' before any kind of dialogue with Russia. 'Weakness of any of our allies will inspire (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,' he said. 'That's why we're asking them to strengthen us, in terms of security guarantees, in terms of weapons, in terms of our future after this war. In my view, he (Putin) only understands force.' The death toll from a Russian ballistic missile strike on Ukraine's southern city of Odesa rose Thursday to eight, regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said. It was the latest in a string of assaults on the Black Sea port. Authorities in Kyiv also announced Thursday that Ukrainian journalist Viktoria Roshchyna died while being in Russian captivity, although the circumstances of her death remained unknown. Moscow admitted detaining Roshchyna, who went missing in 2023 while on a reporting trip to Russia-occupied areas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-city-hops-across-europe-promoting-victory-plan-/7818676.html	2024-10-11T01:00:57-07:00	
US still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, US officials say	WASHINGTON — The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told Reuters. The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program. 'We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,' said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week. U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so. 'We're all watching this space very carefully,' the Biden administration official said. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program. Key Iran ally weakened In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month. The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself. Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is 'higher now than it has been' and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon. That would still take time, however. 'They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months,' said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund. Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog. The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to 'a week or a little more,' according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate. Possible Israeli attack Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the U.S. military. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure. Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat. The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel. Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: 'That's the thing you wanna hit, right?' Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead. 'The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity,' he said. 'They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-still-believes-iran-has-not-decided-to-build-a-nuclear-weapon-us-officials-say/7818664.html	2024-10-11T00:05:22-07:00	
Nobel Prize winner Han Kang's books fly off the shelves in South Korea	seoul, south korea — South Koreans flocked to bookstores Friday and crashed websites in a frenzy to snap up copies of the work of novelist Han Kang in her home country, after her unexpected win of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature. However, the author herself was keeping out of the limelight. The country's largest bookstore chain, Kyobo Book Centre, said sales of her books had rocketed on Friday, with stocks almost immediately selling out and set to be in short supply for the near future. 'This is the first time a Korean has received a Nobel Prize in Literature, so I was amazed,' said Yoon Ki-heon, a 32-year-old visitor at a bookstore in central Seoul. 'South Korea had a poor achievement in winning Nobel Prizes, so I was surprised by news that (a writer of) non-English books, which were written in Korean, won such a big prize.' Soon after Thursday's announcement, some bookstore websites could not be accessed due to heavy traffic. Out of the current 10 bestsellers at Kyobo, nine were Han's books on Friday morning, according to its website. Han's father, well-regarded author Han Seung-won, said the translation of her novel The Vegetarian, her major international breakthrough, had led to her winning the Man Booker International Prize in 2016 and now the Nobel prize. 'My daughter's writing is very delicate, beautiful and sad,' Han Seung-won said. 'So, how you translate that sad sentence into a foreign language will determine whether you win ... It seems the translator was the right person to translate the unique flavor of Korean language.' Han's other books address painful chapters of South Korean history, including Human Acts which examines the 1980 massacre of hundreds of civilians by the South Korean military in the city of Gwangju. Another novel, We Do Not Part, looks at the fallout of the 1948-54 massacre on Jeju island, when an estimated 10% of the island's population were killed in an anti-communist purge. 'I really hope souls of the victims and survivors could be healed from pain and trauma through her book,' said Kim Chang-beom, head of an association for the bereaved families of the Jeju massacre. Park Gang-bae, a director at a foundation that honors the victims and supports the bereaved families and survivors of the Gwangju massacre, said he was 'jubilant and moved ' by her win. 'The protagonists in her book (Human Acts) are people we meet and live with every day, on every corner here, so this is deeply moving,' Park said. Han's father told reporters on Friday that she may continue to shun the limelight after giving no separate comments or interviews and eschewing media scrutiny since Thursday's win. 'She said given the fierce Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine wars and people dying every day, how could she celebrate and hold a joyous press conference?' her father said. Han Kang received the news of her win about 10 to 15 minutes before the announcement, her father said, and was so surprised that she thought it might be a scam at one point.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nobel-prize-winner-han-kang-s-books-fly-off-the-shelves-in-south-korea/7818658.html	2024-10-10T23:14:57-07:00	
Gunmen kill 20 miners, wound others in attack in southwest Pakistan	QUETTA, Pakistan — Gunmen killed 20 miners and wounded another seven in Pakistan’s southwest, a police official said Friday, drawing condemnation from authorities who have ordered police to trace and arrest those who are behind the killings. It’s the latest attack in restive Balochistan province and comes days ahead of a major security summit being hosted in the capital. Police official Hamayun Khan Nasir said the gunmen stormed the accommodations at the coal mine in Duki district late Thursday night, rounded up the men and opened fire. Most of the men were from Pashtun-speaking areas of Balochistan. Three of the dead and four of the wounded were Afghan. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, but the suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, which often targets civilians and security forces. The group committed multiple attacks in August that killed more than 50 people, while authorities responded by killing 21 insurgents in the province. Those killed included 23 passengers, mostly from eastern Punjab province, who were fatally shot after being taken from buses, vehicles and trucks in Musakhail district in Baluchistan. The latest attack drew a strong condemnation from Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister in Balochistan, who said the 'terrorists have once again targeted poor laborers.' He said the attackers were cruel and had an agenda to destabilize Pakistan. 'The killing of these innocent laborers would be avenged,' he said in a statement. The province is home to several separatist groups who want independence. They accuse the federal government in Islamabad of unfairly exploiting oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan at the expense of locals. On Monday, a group called the Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out an attack on Chinese nationals outside Pakistan's biggest airport. There are thousands of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. The explosion, which the BLA said was the work of a suicide bomber, also raised questions about the ability of Pakistani forces to protect high-profile events or foreigners in the country. Islamabad is hosting a summit next week of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a grouping founded by China and Russia to counter Western alliances. Authorities have beefed up security in the capital by deploying troops to prevent any acts of terrorism. The Ministry of Interior this week had alerted the country's four provinces to take additional measures to enhance security as the separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban could launch attacks at public places and government installation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-kill-20-miners-wound-others-in-attack-in-southwest-pakistan/7818644.html	2024-10-10T21:59:45-07:00	
Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's actions in South China Sea	VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's 'increasingly dangerous and unlawful' activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict. China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil. Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it controls. 'We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes,' said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. 'The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific.' The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones. The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country 'continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation' by China. He said it was 'regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged' due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea. Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of 'real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict' if the sea dispute isn't addressed. Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a 'shared home' but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by 'external forces' who sought to 'introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.' Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes. In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States believed 'it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.' China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people. Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s 'destabilizing behavior' and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-tells-asean-the-us-is-worried-about-china-s-actions-in-south-china-sea/7818641.html	2024-10-10T21:49:47-07:00	
New Zealand official: No, ship didn't sink because its captain was a woman	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand's defense minister issued stinging rebukes of what she said were 'vile' and 'misogynistic' online remarks by 'armchair admirals' about the woman captain of a navy ship that ran aground, caught fire and sank off the coast of Samoa. 'Seriously, it's 2024,' Judith Collins told reporters Thursday. 'What the hell's going on here?' After days of comments on social media directed at the gender of Commander Yvonne Gray, Collins urged the public to 'be better.' Women members of the military had also faced verbal abuse in the street in New Zealand since the ship — one of nine in the country's navy — was lost on Sunday, Collins said. All 75 people on board evacuated to safety with only minor injuries after the vessel ran aground on the reef it was surveying about a mile off the coast of Upolu, Samoa's most populous island. The cause of the disaster is not known. 'The one thing that we already know did not cause it is the gender of the ship's captain, a woman with 30 years' naval experience who on the night made the call to get her people to safety,' Collins said. One of the posters was a truck driver from Melbourne, Australia, she added. 'I think that he should keep his comments to people who drive trucks rather than people who drive ships,' Collins said. 'These are the sorts of people I'm calling out and I'm happy to keep calling them out for as long as it takes to stop this behavior.' About 20% of New Zealand's uniformed military members are women. Collins is New Zealand's first woman defense minister and said she stood alongside Gray and Maj. Gen. Rose King, the country's first woman army chief, who assumed her role in June. 'We are all appointed on merit, not gender,' said Collins. The sinking prompted fears of a major fuel spill. On Thursday, officials in Samoa said while the vessel was leaking oil from three places, the amount was reducing each day and was dissipating quickly due to strong winds in the area. Most of the ship's fuel appeared to have burned out in the fire, according to a statement by the Marine Pollution Advisory Committee. Officials were due to meet with locals Thursday to discuss how to remove the vessel's anchor and three shipping containers from the reef without further damaging the fragile marine ecosystem. New Zealand's government has ordered a military court of inquiry into the episode, which will be led by senior military officers. It will assemble for the first time on Friday. Passengers, including civilian scientists and foreign military personnel, left the vessel on lifeboats in 'challenging conditions' and darkness, New Zealand's Chief of Navy Rear Admiral Garin Golding told reporters after the sinking. Those on board have since returned to New Zealand by plane. The specialist dive and hydrographic vessel had been in service for New Zealand since 2019 but was 20 years old and had previously belonged to Norway. The military said the ship, purchased for $100 million NZ dollars ($61 million), was not covered by replacement insurance. The state of New Zealand's aging military hardware has prompted warnings from the defense agency, which in a March report described the navy as 'extremely fragile,' with ships idle due to problems retaining the staff needed to service and maintain them. Of the navy's eight remaining ships, five are currently operational. Golding said the HMNZS Manawanui underwent a maintenance period before the deployment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-official-no-ship-didn-t-sink-because-its-captain-was-a-woman/7818637.html	2024-10-10T21:29:55-07:00	
Hurricane Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida	WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend. But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2. Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur — protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast, spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated, heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for their synagogues' Torah scrolls and themselves. Milton hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone, with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and elderly who cannot evacuate. It's important to be 'with the people and for the people,' and provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm approached. Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and other buildings in the area were not, he said. 'Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community & hold Yom Kippur services,' Minkowicz told The Associated Press via email Thursday. 'We're praying for this to be resolved asap.' The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed the major hurricane, Ian. 'Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you totally connect with God,' Minkowicz said. 'When you go through a hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They're already in that zone where they're totally focused on God.' Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the Reform synagogue. 'It's important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not what anybody wants, but it could've been a lot worse,' he said. 'This feels like a blessing.' The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur's annual reflections. An implicit question, he said before Milton's landfall, is 'If this was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act differently? ... When you've got a historical storm, a potentially life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that message is really present.' Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the synagogue. While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in 2022, Milton's timing hit especially hard, having already forced the postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing. 'It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now,' Luna said from Miami ahead of the storm. 'It's all very heavy.' After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power. She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and in-person services Saturday. 'We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please only come if you can safely navigate the roads,' she said in her message. Luna said she was grateful for the 'big outpouring of support' she received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized they can come as they are since few grabbed 'holiday-appropriate clothing' in the rush to escape Milton's fury. The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the day of fasting. 'We were spared, thank God,' Andrusier said of the storm. 'We've been able to open up our doors' for those in the hurricane zone. Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off Sarasota Bay, won't be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander, CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee. Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn't worth risking Milton's might for Day of Atonement services. They had celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last month. Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend's home inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from Longboat Key and other temples that won't have services can say their prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels, cream cheese and smoked salmon. Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said. 'It's in difficult times that you really understand the power of community,' he said. 'And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish community.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-milton-disrupts-yom-kippur-plans-for-jews-in-florida/7818633.html	2024-10-10T21:18:34-07:00
