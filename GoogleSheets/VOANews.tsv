US court declines to block release of one special counsel report on Trump	A U.S. appeals court on Thursday declined to block the U.S. Justice Department from releasing a special counsel's investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. The ruling from the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit appeared to clear the way for the release of the report as early as next week. The appeals court's decision did not immediately lift an order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon earlier this week pausing the release of the report. But Cannon set her order to expire three days after the appeals court ruled on the issue. The appeals court invited the Justice Department to bring a separate appeal if it wished to reverse that ruling. The report is likely to be the final act from special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two historic cases against Trump for attempting to subvert the 2020 election results and for mishandling classified documents. Smith dropped both cases after Trump’s election victory and neither reached a trial. Thursday's ruling came after Trump's two former co-defendants in the classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, asked the appeals court to block the release of the report, arguing it would interfere with their ongoing prosecution. The report for now is set to detail only the 2020 election probe after Attorney General Merrick Garland, who appointed Smith, decided not to publicly release the portion focused on the classified documents while legal proceedings against Trump’s two former co-defendants continue. The Justice Department plans to allow only certain senior members of Congress to review that section of the report, the department said in a court filing. Nauta and De Oliveira argued that even the limited release of the documents section of the report to Congress could harm their defense against obstruction charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. It is unclear how much new information the public portion of the report will contain. Smith and a House of Representatives panel have already released detailed accounts of Trump’s actions surrounding the 2020 election, including during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the cases against him were part of an effort to damage his political campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7931846.html	2025-01-09T19:14:00-08:00	
Biden releases resources to fight wildfires, shelter victims in California	U.S. President Joe Biden said at a White House briefing Thursday afternoon that federal resources and additional funding have been made available to California to fight the wildfires that he described as the 'worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles.' The money will be used, the president said, to cover all of the costs for 180 days for temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials, first responder salaries and measures to protect life. Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator for California, also spoke at the briefing. Harris described the situation in California as 'apocalyptic' and 'something that is going to have an impact for months and years to come.' The vice president has a home in an evacuation zone, but it was not immediately clear whether her house sustained any damage. While the death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires stands at five, Southern California officials say that number will likely increase once the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through the ruins. Authorities said the wildfires burning in and around the city of Los Angeles have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and burned tens of thousands of hectares of land. 'This is absolutely an unprecedented, historic firestorm,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. At a news briefing Thursday, Los Angeles city and county officials provided an update on the fires and the efforts to bring them under control. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the fierce winds that had driven the fires calmed enough to allow firefighters to increase containment and air operations to resume. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area: the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Sunset fires, with the Palisades and Eaton fires being the largest. The sparking of a sixth fire — the Kenneth Fire, near Woodland Hills — was announced Thursday, and a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for that area, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in its last report that the fires had burned more than 11,750 hectares of land, an announcement made before the addition of the Kenneth Fire. Some people are apparently preying on the devastated neighborhoods, and at least 20 people have been arrested in recent days for looting. 'I promise you, you will be held accountable,' Los Angeles Supervisor Kathryn Barger said at a press conference Thursday. 'Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis,' Barger said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst and Lidia fires have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 residents, and another 200,000 residents are under evacuation orders. Fire Chief Crowley called the Palisades Fire alone 'one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles.' Officials said Thursday that more than 5,000 homes and other structures have been lost in Palisades. A leading national credit rating service echoed that view. In a statement Thursday, Morningstar-DBRS credit service said preliminary estimates show the fires could result in more than $8 billion in property losses. Citing local fire officials, Morningstar-DBRS said the fires have already destroyed more than 1,100 homes and threaten more than 28,000 structures. The organization, which monitors and evaluates risk, said it expects the wildfires to have an adverse but manageable impact on California property insurers. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-releases-resources-to-fight-wildfires-shelter-victims-in-california/7931822.html	2025-01-09T18:44:47-08:00	
Russia turns to China to step up AI race against US	WASHINGTON — Russia's efforts to obtain China's help in enhancing artificial intelligence is seen as a bid to challenge America's lead in the field even as the outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose new export control measures to further curb Beijing's access to AI chips. As the new year began, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's state-owned Sberbank, to work with China in researching and developing AI technology, according to the Kremlin. 'The Russian president sees his country in global competition for AI with the United States and has positioned the state resources to try and compete with the U.S. in information and cyberspace – two areas where artificial intelligence is supposed to aid Russia in what they see as Western narratives and influence,' said Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Moscow views Beijing's success in AI as an example to follow, and its 'cooperation with China is viewed as a necessary step towards acquiring artificial intelligence-related skill sets, knowledge and technology,' Bendett told VOA in written comments. The U.S. currently leads in AI innovation, followed by China, which is falling behind by wide margins, according to a November report by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Russia ranks 31st out of 83 countries in AI implementation, innovation and investment, according to U.K.-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index. Response to sanctions Western sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have limited the country's AI development, and Moscow has turned to Beijing to offset the restriction, according to Bendett in his report 'The Role of AI in Russia's Confrontation with the West.' Sberbank, which Putin instructed to collaborate with China, is under Western sanctions. It is Russia's largest bank and leads the country's AI development efforts. The outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose a new set of export control measures aimed at further limiting China's ability to access chips that support AI technology. The new measures could come as early as Friday, according to Bloomberg. Sberbank CEO German Gref said in 2023 that Russia cannot obtain graphics processing units, microchips needed to support AI development, according to Reuters. But the bank's first deputy CEO, Alexander Vedyakhin, said in December that despite Western sanctions, Russia can improve its AI ranking by 2030 through its own development. Another key area where Russia has sought to further apply AI help from China is in the military. 'There already have been top level meetings between Russia and Chinese militaries in 2024,' and 'ongoing dialogue' between the defense ministries of the two countries is likely so they can understand 'how AI could aid in a large-scale conventional conflict, like the one unfolding in Ukraine,' Bendett said. Russian and Chinese officials met in Beijing early last year to discuss military application of AI, especially in developing autonomous weapons, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry. AI-powered weapons In December, Ukraine said Russia began using AI-powered strike drones with improved capabilities that can evade air defenses, identify key targets and operate offline. James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Russia is likely to use AI technology on enhancing drones as well as in making weapons with improved target detection and attack speed. The China-Russia AI partnership 'creates new risk for the U.S.,' but military application of 'AI won't compensate for bad strategy' in the battlefield, he said. Attending an AI conference in Moscow last month, Song Haitao, president of the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, said China plans to sign an agreement with Russia's Sberbank to promote bilateral cooperation on AI development. Speaking at the conference, Putin applauded China for 'making great strides' in advancing AI technology and its application, including in building 'smart cities' and conducting 'modern governance.' Sam Bresnick, research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said although it is not entirely clear how Beijing might benefit from helping Moscow in developing AI, China might want some military technologies and wartime data from Russia in return. 'Russia is very good at making submarines, and there's been a speculation in the past that China could benefit from acquiring that kind of technology. Another one is helicopter technology,' Bresnick said. 'The war in Ukraine has generated an astonishing amount of data,' Bresnick continued. 'China would probably be interested in getting its hands on them because having more militarily relevant data from Russia would help China develop its own AI systems for military.' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Thursday that 'in terms of the application of artificial intelligence, China actively advocates the principles of 'people-oriented' and 'intelligent for good,' ensuring that artificial intelligence is safe, reliable and controllable, better enabling global sustainable development, and enhancing the common well-being of all mankind.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-turns-to-china-to-step-up-ai-race-against-us/7931829.html	2025-01-09T18:21:42-08:00	
Supreme Court allows sentencing of Trump to go forward	Donald Trump will be sworn in January 20 as the only U.S. president with felony convictions, and this week saw a flurry of activity over the court cases still open against him.

Biden refutes Trump attacks, pledges federal aid to fight California fires	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said wildfires ravaging Los Angeles show climate change is real, days before President-elect Donald Trump is to take office. Trump has threatened to pull back on U.S. efforts to combat global warming. 'Climate change is real. ... There is global warming, it's real,' Biden told a crisis meeting at the White House on the fires. 'This is the most widespread, devastating fire in California's history,' Biden said as he convened the meeting. Trump has used the wildfires to attack Biden and California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on social media. The outgoing president canceled a trip to Rome to stay in Washington and coordinate the U.S. government response to the fires, which have killed at least five people. He said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of dealing with the disaster for the first 180 days, at Newsom's request. Biden said he was surging 400 federal firefighters and 30 firefighting planes and helicopters to Los Angeles, while the Pentagon will send eight large planes and 500 wildfire clearance personnel. Meanwhile, Biden sought to debunk claims pushed by Trump that there was a water shortage that left firefighters struggling to put out the inferno. Biden said the problem lay not with a shortage of water but with power cuts that took water pumps offline. During wildfires, utility companies can cut electricity amid fears that faulty power lines could spark more fires. Trump's remarks on Wednesday and Thursday came as firefighters were trying to contain the blazes that have killed five people and destroyed more than 2,000 structures. 'One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America is burning down to the ground,' Trump said on his Truth Social network late Wednesday, blaming the fires on Newsom and calling on him to resign. Trump returned to the subject Thursday morning as the blazes continued to rage. Without providing evidence, he variously accused Newsom of 'incompetence' in managing the fires and of wasting water in drought-hit California. The California governor strongly rejected Trump's claims in an interview with CNN. 'People are literally fleeing. ... This guy wanted to politicize it. I have a lot of thoughts, and I know what I want to say. I won't,' Newsom said. Trump accused Biden on Thursday of diverting money to 'Green New Scam' climate policies instead of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Biden has repeatedly denied steering funds away from FEMA, including in October when Trump made similar accusations after hurricanes devastated the U.S. Southeast a month before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. California has long been a target of Trump's ire, with the most populous U.S. state long having voted for Democrats. He made some modest gains in the 2024 election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-refutes-trump-attacks-pledges-federal-aid-to-fight-california-fires-/7931785.html	2025-01-09T17:49:10-08:00	
Denmark says it has neglected Greenland defense for years	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK — Denmark acknowledged Thursday that it had long neglected the defense of Greenland, a vast and strategically important Arctic island - and one that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called vital for U.S. security. Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, said this week that U.S. control of Greenland - a sovereign Danish territory - was an 'absolute necessity,' and he did not rule out using military or economic action against Denmark to make it happen. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in ships and in aircraft that will help monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told journalists. The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said earlier Thursday that the United States had no plans to increase its military presence in Greenland. 'There are no plans to increase the United States' current military footprint in Greenland,' the spokesperson told Reuters. 'We will continue to work closely with Copenhagen and Nuuk [Greenland's capital] to ensure any proposals meet our common security needs.' Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late Thursday that she had asked for a meeting with Trump but did not expect one to happen ahead of his inauguration. US military presence Greenland has been controlled by Denmark for centuries, though its 57,000 people now govern their own domestic affairs. Its security and foreign affairs, however, are still handled by Copenhagen. The U.S. military maintains a permanent presence at the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland's northwest. Greenland is crucial for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early-warning system, since the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the island. 'I think that the Americans are quite concerned that Russia could actually launch or initiate a major attack against the United States, and that could be done from the Russian side,' Jens Wenzel at Nordic Defense Analysis told Reuters. 'There is no real monitoring of the airspace in Greenland. It is largely a free-for-all,' he said. Greenland is already covered by U.S. security guarantees via Denmark's membership in NATO. Frederiksen said this week that she could not imagine the United States would use military intervention in Greenland and said it was up to the people of Greenland to decide what they want. 'Tightrope' Frederiksen summoned leaders of Denmark's political parties to a meeting Thursday for a briefing about Trump's renewed interest. She rebuffed an offer from him in 2019 to buy Greenland. On Wednesday, Frederiksen hosted Greenland's leader, Mute Egede, for talks in Copenhagen. Egede favors independence for his homeland and has said it is not for sale. Egede discussed trade and other issues with the outgoing U.S. ambassador in Copenhagen on Wednesday, the embassy said. Last month, Trump said he had picked Ken Howery as the new U.S. envoy to Denmark. As a co-founder of PayPal, Howery is considered a member of the group of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. 'They're walking a tightrope,' said Lin Alexandra Mortensgaard, a Greenland expert at the Danish Institute for International Studies, referring to the Danish and Greenland prime ministers. 'It's a balance between representing an autonomous territory and representing a sovereign state while still taking the requirements of Denmark's closest ally seriously,' she said. Denmark's European allies France and Germany have responded to Trump's comments by stressing the inviolability of borders. British Foreign Minister David Lammy said Thursday that he believed Trump recognized Greenland was part of Denmark and that concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic lay behind the U.S. president-elect's remarks. The Kremlin said Thursday that Moscow was following closely the 'dramatic development' on Greenland and that the Arctic fell within Russia's zone of strategic national interests. In Greenland, opinions on the island's future appear divided, with some warmly welcoming Trump's remarks and others responding skeptically. Danish lawmakers across the political spectrum have urged Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, to firmly reject any attempt by foreign powers to undermine Greenland's status. 'The U.S. wants to take over Denmark's role in Greenland, and the Danish government must say a clear and unequivocal no to that,' former conservative minister Rasmus Jarlov said on X. Meanwhile, the screenwriter of the hit Danish TV drama series 'Borgen,' Adam Price, joked on Instagram that it was becoming 'increasingly difficult to write political fiction when real-life politics are becoming more and more extreme.' 'All that's left is to get some popcorn,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/denmark-says-it-has-neglected-greenland-defense-for-years-/7931744.html	2025-01-09T16:30:51-08:00

Vance to resign from US Senate ahead of his inauguration as vice president	washington — Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance said Thursday that he would resign from his U.S. Senate seat from Ohio at midnight ahead of his inauguration later this month. President-elect Donald Trump and Vance defeated the Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Vance's Senate seat will be filled by a person appointed by Ohio Republican Governor Mike DeWine. The replacement will serve until a special election is held in November 2026. The winner of that election will finish the remainder of Vance's Senate term, which ends in January 2029. In his resignation letter to the Ohio governor, Vance wrote that 'it has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio in the Senate over the past two years.' Republicans won a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the November elections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-to-resign-from-us-senate-ahead-of-his-inauguration-as-vice-president/7931504.html	2025-01-09T16:04:19-08:00	
Russia 'observing' Greenland situation; Europe cautious on Trump remarks	london — Russia has said it is closely watching the situation with Greenland, following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's refusal to rule out military or economic measures to take control of the territory from Denmark. 'We are observing this rather dramatic development of the situation, but so far, thank God, [it remains] at the level of statements,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. 'The Arctic zone is a zone of our national and strategic interests. We are present in the Arctic zone, and we will continue to be there,' Peskov added. The vast territory of Greenland — most of which lies above the Arctic Circle — has been officially part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1953, although the island has its own government. National security Questioned at a news conference in Florida on Tuesday, Trump said the United States needs Greenland for security purposes, and he refused to rule out using economic or military means to achieve that goal. 'People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it. But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world. I'm talking about protecting the free world,' Trump said. 'You have Chinese ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen,' he added. Like much of the Arctic, Greenland is rapidly warming. That is changing the geopolitics of the region, said analyst Liana Fix of the Council on Foreign Relations. 'The Arctic is increasingly becoming a zone of a great power competition and rivalry. And the United States is concerned it is losing this game,' Fix said. 'The Arctic becomes much more accessible, both for trading goods but also for critical minerals, especially for rare earth [minerals],' Fix said. 'And also it becomes increasingly a militarized zone,' she added, noting that Russia is cooperating with the Chinese coast guard in the region. Not for sale Denmark has made it clear that Greenland is not for sale. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen rejected the suggestion that Trump's comments presented a foreign policy crisis for his government. 'I see a president who is on his way into the White House, who has a heightened focus on the Arctic, and I can understand that he has that. We also have that from the Danish side, and we also have that within NATO,' Rasmussen said Wednesday. Denmark faces a dilemma, said analyst Fix. 'It is very clear for Denmark, too, that increased cooperation with the United States both on investments in Greenland but also on military cooperation would be actually in the interest of everyone,' Fix told VOA. Several European leaders rejected Trump's comments, although most stopped short of directly criticizing the incoming U.S. president. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said basic Western values were at stake. 'The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,' he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was more direct. 'It is out of the question for the European Union to let any nation in the world, whichever it is — and let me say starting with Russia — define its sovereign borders,' he said Wednesday. Greenland independence Greenland's government, meanwhile, is pushing for a referendum on full independence and has said that only the people will decide Greenland's future. 'Greenland is on its way into a new era and a new year in which Greenland has been at the center of world attention. The Greenlandic people are one people, regardless of where they live. And as people in the times we live in, we must be united in order to be ready for a new future that our country is on its way to,' Prime Minister Mute Egede said during a trip to Copenhagen on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-observing-greenland-situation-europe-cautious-on-trump-remarks-/7931461.html	2025-01-09T15:10:44-08:00	
African ministers meet in Uganda to shape 10-year food security, sustainability plan	NAIROBI, KENYA — Africa's agriculture ministers are meeting in Uganda this week to discuss the best way to transform the continent's food production systems. The ministers hope to agree on a 10-year action plan to reduce Africa's reliance on food from outside the continent and adapt its farming practices to climate change and modern technology. The ministers and more than 2,000 delegates are meeting in Kampala to discuss sustainable agriculture and food production systems. Speaking at the opening of the summit, Uganda's prime minister, Robinah Nabbanja, urged ministers to provide policies and solutions that can make the continent food self-reliant. 'As the continent's agriculture sector ministers, I urge you to deliberately work to reduce Africa's over-reliance on food imports from outside of the continent,' Nabbanja said. 'We must position the continent in such a manner that our agriculture sector is resilient to climate change as well as other shocks and is adaptive to advances in technology.' In recent years, Africa has witnessed a sharp increase in food prices due to droughts, floods, conflict and climate change. According to the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD, the number of people experiencing food insecurity worldwide increased from 512 million in 2014 to more than 790 million in 2021. The African ministers are meeting in Uganda again to review strategies for food security in the next 10 years, given the changing weather, people's food preferences, increased conflicts and shrinking agricultural farmlands. Despite the challenges ahead, David Nabarro, co-founder of the 4SD Foundation, an organization that works on the transformation of food systems, said that with cooperation between countries and organizations, Africa has the capacity to be food self-sufficient. 'This could lead Africa as a region becoming less of a region that needs to import nutritious food for its people and move to a situation perhaps in 10 years where it can be self-sufficient or even in some cases more exporting,' Nabarro said. 'So individual African country's examples would be brought together and shared because the whole cadre approach is where you monitor progress and share that progress between countries and use that as a way to bring everybody's standards up higher.' The director of the Institute of Livestock and Research Institute, Appolinaire Djikeng, said strong collaboration and greater investments in agriculture by African governments could bring lasting change in Africa's food production. 'The food systems transformations and food systems challenges demonstrated that one organization cannot do it alone,' Djikeng said. 'It is about a coalition, and I want to see that part strengthened. But more importantly, I would like to see governments really investing, committing to invest in the national budget to develop agriculture and building capacities so that we have people who are trained, we have institutions, but also linking that to policy, we need to see the right policy.' According to analysts who track the progress of the goals and targets of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), several countries, such as Benin, Ethiopia, Lesotho, and Malawi, have spent more than 10% of their budgets to improve their agriculture sectors. The summit ends Saturday, and heads of state are expected to attend and endorse a CAADP strategy and action plan that could shape the continent's food systems for 10 years beginning in 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-ministers-meet-in-uganda-to-shape-10-year-food-security-sustainability-plan-/7931443.html	2025-01-09T14:51:05-08:00	
UN watchdog faults Australia for treatment of migrants on Nauru	GENEVA — Australia violated the rights of asylum-seekers arbitrarily detained on the island of Nauru, a U.N. watchdog ruled Thursday, in a warning to other countries intent on outsourcing asylum processing. The U.N. Human Rights Committee published decisions in two cases involving 25 refugees and asylum-seekers who endured years of arbitrary detention in the island nation. 'A state party cannot escape its human rights responsibility when outsourcing asylum processing to another state,' committee member Mahjoub El Haiba said in a statement. Under a hard-line policy introduced more than a decade ago, Australia has sent thousands of migrants attempting to reach the country by boat to detention centers on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru, which lies further to the northwest. Victims in both cases filed complaints to the U.N. committee of 18 independent experts, charging that Australia had violated their rights under an international covenant, in particular regarding arbitrary detention. Australia rejected the allegations, insisting that abuses that occurred in Nauru did not fall within its jurisdiction. But the U.N. committee highlighted that Australia had arranged for the establishment of Nauru's regional processing center and contributed to its operation and management. El Haiba said Australia did have jurisdiction because it 'had significant control and influence over the regional processing facility in Nauru.' 'Not human rights-free zones' A number of European countries have been examining the possibility of similar arrangements to outsource their migration policies. Thursday's decisions 'send a clear message to all states: Where there is power or effective control, there is responsibility,' El Haiba said. 'The outsourcing of operations does not absolve states of accountability. Offshore detention facilities are not human rights-free zones.' The first case examined by the committee involved 24 unaccompanied minors from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. They were intercepted at sea by Australia and transferred in 2014 to Nauru's overcrowded Regional Processing Center. They were held there 'with insufficient water supply and sanitation, high temperatures and humidity, as well as inadequate health care,' Thursday's statement said. 'Almost all of these minors have suffered from deterioration of physical and mental well-being, including self-harm, depression, kidney problems, insomnia, headaches, memory problems and weight loss.' Compensation Even though all but one of the minors were granted refugee status around September 2014, they remained detained in Nauru, the committee said. It said Australia had failed to justify why the minors could not have been transferred to centers on the mainland more suitable for vulnerable individuals. The committee separately evaluated the case of an Iranian asylum seeker who arrived by boat on Christmas Island with several family members in August 2013 and was transferred seven months later to Nauru. The woman was recognized as a refugee by Nauru authorities in 2017 but was not released. In November 2018, she was transferred to Australia in November 2018 for medical reasons but remained detained in various facilities there, the committee said. It determined that Australia had failed to show that the woman's prolonged and indefinite detention was justified. The committee called on Australia to compensate the victims and take steps to ensure similar violations do not recur. The committee has no power to compel states to follow its rulings, but its decisions carry reputational weight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-watchdog-faults-australia-for-treatment-of-migrants-on-nauru-/7931362.html	2025-01-09T13:00:58-08:00	
Italy's FM encourages post-Assad transition, calls for EU to review sanctions	ROME — Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is traveling to Syria on Friday to encourage the country's transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents, and said Europe should review its sanctions on Damascus now that the political situation has changed. Tajani presided Thursday over a meeting in Rome of foreign ministry officials from five countries — Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States — and spoke earlier by telephone with his counterparts from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The aim, he said, is to coordinate the various post-Assad initiatives, with Italy prepared to make proposals on private investments in health care for the Syrian population. Going into the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their European counterparts, Tajani said it was critical that all Syrians be recognized with equal rights. It was a reference to concerns about the rights of Christians and other minorities under Syria's new de facto authorities of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamic militant group that the U.S. and United Nations have long designated as a terrorist organization. 'The first messages from Damascus have been positive. That's why I'm going there tomorrow, to encourage this new phase that will help stabilize the international situation,' said Tajani. Speaking to reporters, he said the European Union should discuss possible changes to the sanctions regime on Syria. 'It's an issue that should be discussed because Assad isn't there anymore, it's a new situation, and I think that the encouraging signals that are arriving should be further encouraged,' he said. Syria has been under deeply isolating sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad's brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on December 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month. Syria's new leaders also have been urged to respect the rights of minorities and women. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria's civil war, either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-fm-heads-to-syria-to-encourage-post-assad-transition-calls-for-eu-to-review-sanctions-/7931357.html	2025-01-09T13:00:29-08:00	
Carter funeral brings together 1 current, 4 ex-presidents to honor one of their own	WASHINGTON — As they filed into the front pews at the National Cathedral, wearing dark suits and mostly solemn faces, one current and four former presidents came together for Jimmy Carter's funeral. For a service that stretched more than an hour, the feuding, grievances and enmity that had marked their rival campaigns and divergent politics gave way to a reverential moment for one of their own. Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two of the group to take their seats Thursday, shook hands and chatted at length. Trump, the former president who will retake the Oval Office in 11 days, leaned in and listened intently to his predecessor. At times, the two flashed smiles. Obama, who attended without his wife, Michelle, shared a second-row pew with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived last and sat in the pew just in front of them. Members of the exclusive presidents' club were on their best behavior. Bonded by the presidency, they rarely criticize one another or the White House's current occupant — although Trump has flouted those rules frequently. He has praised and criticized Carter in recent days, and he complained that flags will still be at half-staff to honor the deceased president during his inauguration. Trump looked up when Vice President Kamala Harris — whom he defeated in November's hard-fought election — entered the cathedral, but he didn't move to greet her as she and husband Doug Emhoff took seats directly in front of him and Melania Trump. Nor did Harris acknowledge him. After the service, Emhoff turned around to shake hands with Trump. Obama, with Trump on his left, also turned to his right to chat with Bush. Clinton, with wife Hillary, was the last of the ex-presidents to take a seat and got in some chatter with Bush as well. The White House said the former presidents also met privately before taking their seats. Funerals are among the few events that bring members of the presidents' club together. In a way, former President Gerald Ford was there, too: Ford's son Steven read a eulogy for Carter that Ford had written before he died in 2006. Busy with personal pursuits, charitable endeavors and sometimes lucrative speaking gigs, the former leaders don't mingle often. They all know the protocol of state funerals well — each has been involved in planning his own. During the 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, then-President Trump sat with his predecessors and their spouses, including the Carters, and the interactions were stiff and sometimes awkward. This time, Trump also didn't appear to interact with Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election. Trump was seated in the pew in front of his former vice president, Mike Pence — one of the few times they have coincided at events since Pence refused to overturn the results of the 2020 election after Trump lost to Biden. The two shook hands but didn't speak much beyond that. Trump, who largely avoided contact with the former presidents during his first term — and pointedly did not seek their advice — has been critical of Republican former presidents, particularly the Bush family, which made him an uneasy member of the former presidents' club. Carter himself didn't particularly relish being a member of the club, at times criticizing its staid traditions. Many past presidents have built relationships with their predecessors, including Bill Clinton, who reached out to Richard Nixon for advice on Russian policy, and Harry Truman, who sought counsel from Herbert Hoover. One of the first calls Obama made after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 was to George W. Bush to spread the word that the mission had been accomplished, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of Team of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump. 'It's the loneliest job in the world, so usually they reach out and rely on each other,' said Andersen Brower. 'But Trump didn't have that the first term, so this will just be another four years where he doesn't depend on anyone who came before him.' She noted that Carter spent years as a proud Washington outsider and skipped the unveiling of his own portrait to avoid being in the same room with the man who beat him in 1980, President Ronald Reagan. 'Carter and Trump, even though they have the least in common about everything else, are similar,' Andersen Brower said, 'in just how they approach telling what they actually think.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/carter-funeral-brings-together-1-current-4-ex-presidents-to-honor-one-of-their-own/7931345.html	2025-01-09T12:59:55-08:00

Worst in Show' CES products put data at risk and cause waste, privacy advocates say	LAS VEGAS — So much of the technology showcased at CES includes gadgets made to improve consumers' lives — whether by leveraging AI to make devices that help people become more efficient, by creating companions to cure loneliness, or by providing tools that help people with mental and physical health. But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as 'Worst in Show.' The award that no company wants to win calls out the 'least repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on display.' 'We're seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,' Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. 'But it also means that now we've got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.' The fourth annual contest announced its decisions Thursday. A new smart ring every few years? Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring the title of 'least repairable.' The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost $2,200. Wiens said the jewelry 'looks sleek but hides a major flaw: its battery only lasts 500 charges.' Worse, he said, is the fact that replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device entirely. 'Luxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,' he said. Ultrahuman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An AI-powered smart crib? Bosch's 'Revol' crib uses sensors, cameras and AI that the company says can help monitor vital signs like how an infant is sleeping, heart and respiratory rates and more. The crib can also rock gently if the baby needs help falling asleep and signal to parents if a blanket or other object is interfering with breathing. EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn said the crib preys on parents' fears and 'collects excessive data about babies via a camera, microphone, and even a radar sensor.' 'Parents expect safety and comfort — not surveillance and privacy risks — in their children's cribs,' she said in the report. A spokesperson for Bosch told The Associated Press that all data is encrypted end-to-end and stored on Bosch-administered servers, 'while all data at rest is secured locally with individual data encryption keys.' 'Caregivers have the final say on whether data is transmitted at all. The Revol has an offline mode, which keeps data local if preferred,' the spokesperson said, adding that the smart crib helps keep children safe. Too much waste? Although AI is everywhere at CES, Stacey Higginbotham, a policy Fellow at Consumer Reports, felt that SoundHound AI's In-Car Commerce Ecosystem, powered by its Automotive AI, pushes it to unnecessary extremes. The feature 'increases energy consumption, encourages wasteful takeout consumption and distracts drivers — all while adding little value,' Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as 'least sustainable' on the list. Soundhound AI's platform allows drivers and passengers to order takeout for pick-up directly from the car's infotainment system. The company did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement Tuesday, Keyvan Mohajer, CEO of SoundHound AI, said the product's launch marks a moment 'decades in the making.' 'What begins here with food and restaurants will ultimately open up a whole new commercial ecosystem for vehicle and device manufacturers everywhere,' he said. Vulnerable to hacking? TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for 'least secure' of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger. 'By Chinese law, TP-Link must report security flaws to the government before alerting the public, creating a significant national security risk,' he said. 'Yet TP-Link showcased its Archer BE900 router at CES without addressing these vulnerabilities.' In an email response, TP-Link Systems contested the report. 'TP-Link Systems Inc. is a U.S.-headquartered company and does not provide any such security reporting to China as referenced by iFixit,' the company said. 'TP-Link Systems has a secure, vertically-integrated, and U.S.-owned international supply chain. Nearly all products sold in the United States are manufactured in Vietnam.' TP-Link said it controls its own supply chains, and 'is constantly assessing potential risks to its U.S. operations, customers, and supply chain,' adding that it acknowledges that vulnerabilities exist across the industry. 'However, contrary to claims of widespread vulnerabilities, comparative data places TP-Link on par with, or in some cases ahead of, other major industry players in terms of security outcomes,' the company said. Who asked for this? The awards also feature a category called 'who asked for this?' Top of that list was Samsung's Bespoke AI Washing Machine, which Nathan Proctor, senior director of U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, said is filled 'with features no one needs,' including the ability to make phone calls. 'These add-ons only make the appliance more expensive, fragile, and harder to repair,' he said. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. At a press conference at CES Tuesday, Jong-Hee Han, vice chairman of Samsung's device experience division, said that he was 'proud of how we have introduced new technologies and intelligence to the home, connected key devices and set the standard for the home of the future.' 'We are reinforcing our commitment to delivering personalized experiences through our widespread implementation of AI and we will continue this journey of AI leadership in the home and beyond, not just for the next decade, but for the next century,' he said. Worst overall Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of The Repair Association, called the LG 'AI Home Inside 2.0 Refrigerator with ThinkQ' the worst product overall. The fridge adds 'flashy features,' Gordon-Byrne said, including a screen and internet connection. 'But these come at a cost,' Gordon-Byrne said. 'Shorter software support, higher energy consumption, and expensive repairs reduce the fridge's practical lifespan, leaving consumers with an expensive, wasteful gadget.' LG did not respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/worst-in-show-ces-products-put-data-at-risk-and-cause-waste-privacy-advocates-say/7931337.html	2025-01-09T12:33:06-08:00	
Venezuelan opposition leader emerges from hideout to join anti-Maduro rally	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on Thursday left her hideout and reappeared in public for the first time in months, risking arrest as anti-government protesters made a last-ditch attempt to block President Nicolas Maduro from clinging to power. 'They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united,' Machado, waving a Venezuelan flag, shouted to a few hundred protesters from atop a truck in the capital. 'We are not afraid! We are not afraid!' shouted demonstrators who sang the Venezuelan national anthem to herald Machado's brave defiance of Maduro. The protests are taking place a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly is scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election. There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who have witnessed Maduro's security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past. 'Of course, there's fewer people,' said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. 'There's fear.' Protesters repudiate Maduro Those demonstrators who did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado's call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Edmundo Gonzalez — Machado's last-minute stand-in on the ballot — as Venezuela's legitimate president. The deployment of security forces, as well as pro-government armed groups known as 'colectivos' to intimidate opponents, betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College. Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people — including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners — who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil-rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonzalez's son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school. 'It's an impressive show of force, but it's also a sign of weakness,' said Corrales, who co-authored an article this month in the Journal of Democracy titled, 'How Maduro Stole Venezuela's Vote.' 'Maduro is safe in office,' said Corrales, 'but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.' Gonzalez, who has been crisscrossing the Americas this week after fleeing to Spain in September, appeared to walk back a pledge to return to Venezuela to take office himself on January 10, saying instead he'd be back 'very soon.' 'It's evident that a regime like that represents a threat to the hemisphere,' he said while visiting the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America. 'That is why we Venezuelans are determined to persevere in this fight until the end.' Electoral council declares Maduro winner Venezuela's National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results. The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro's government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonzalez as Venezuela's president-elect. Even many of Maduro's former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday's swearing-in ceremony. U.S. President Joe Biden, meeting Gonzalez at the White House this week, praised the previously unknown retired diplomat for having 'inspired millions.' 'The people of Venezuela deserve a peaceful transfer of power to the true winner of their presidential election,' Biden said following the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-opposition-leader-emerges-from-hideout-to-join-anti-maduro-rally/7931304.html	2025-01-09T12:23:54-08:00	
Biden administration battles on against plea deal for accused 9/11 mastermind	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration doubled down Thursday on its unusual court battle to derail a plea deal that the government itself had reached with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward as scheduled Friday at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Defense lawyers described the attempts to throw out the agreement as the latest in two decades of 'fitful' and 'negligent' mishandling of the case by the U.S. military and successive administrations. The fight has put the Biden administration at odds with the U.S. military officials it had appointed to oversee justice in al-Qaida's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. It was the latest tumult and uncertainty in two decades of troubled prosecution tied to one of the deadliest attacks on American soil. A new filing Thursday from Justice Department lawyers argued that the gravity of the 'extraordinarily important case' warranted Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intervening to throw out the plea deal. Asked about the appeal Thursday after a meeting in Germany with allies about military support for Ukraine, Austin told reporters he had not changed his mind on the matter and cited the court challenge in declining further comment. The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon's senior official for Guantanamo in late July, would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants the risk of the death penalty. It also obligates them to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks. Defense attorneys say that the plea agreements are already in effect and that Austin has no legal authority to throw them out after the fact. At Guantanamo, preparations have moved ahead for Friday's proceedings, and family members of some of the victims already have gathered. If the hearing goes forward, Mohammed would swear an oath in the military courtroom and then defense attorney Gary Sowards would enter pleas on his behalf to 2,976 counts of murder, along with other charges. Pleas by co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi would follow later this month. Attorneys say months of sentencing hearings to follow would give the government an opportunity to outline its case and allow families to speak of their loss. The federal appeals panel appears on track to rule Thursday on the emergency request by the Biden administration. Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the 17 years since charges were filed against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks. The case remains in pretrial hearings, with no trial date set. Years of defense and prosecution testimony have dragged on about how much the torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders their later statements unusable in court. With that in mind, military prosecutors notified families of the victims this summer that the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo had approved a plea deal. They called it 'the best path to finality and justice.' Austin unexpectedly announced on Aug. 2 that he was scrapping the agreement. He argued that a decision on death penalties in an attack as grave as Sept. 11 should be made only by the defense secretary. The Biden administration went to the District of Columbia federal appeals court this week after the Guantanamo judge and a military review panel rejected Austin's intervention. Mohammed's attorneys argued that Austin's 'extraordinary intervention in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own duly appointed delegate,' meaning the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo. The Justice Department said the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to 'seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-battles-on-over-plea-deal-for-accused-9-11-mastermind/7931310.html	2025-01-09T12:09:27-08:00	
Thousands protest as Austria's far-right-led coalition talks set to begin	VIENNA — Talks to form a coalition government led by Austria's far-right Freedom Party, or FPO, will begin Friday, the party said on Thursday, as thousands protested in Vienna against the prospect of the country's first FPO-led government. The eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO won September's parliamentary election with around 29% of the vote but was initially sidelined as centrist parties tried to form a ruling coalition without it. That effort failed at the weekend, and FPO leader Herbert Kickl was tasked with forming a government. 'First step: negotiations on the budget as of tomorrow,' Kickl said in a statement on Thursday evening while protesters carrying placards reading 'Nazis out' and 'History is repeating itself' gathered in the square that stands between the offices of the president and the chancellor. Chancellor Karl Nehammer of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), who had led the centrist coalition talks, said on Saturday he was stepping down because they had collapsed. His successor as head of the caretaker government, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, is due to take over on Friday. Various nongovernmental organizations that deal with human rights, refugees and the environment called Thursday's protest. 'Our republic is at a crossroads,' the organizers said in a statement. 'The threat of an extreme right-wing chancellor looms and with him an attack on democracy, human rights, judiciary, independent media and social cohesion in our country.' More than 10,000 protesters packed tightly together on the square and streets leading into it whistled, jeered and shone their phone lights toward the chancellor's office, chanting 'Kickl out' in a peaceful atmosphere. The OVP, which under Nehammer said it would not govern with Kickl, calling him a conspiracy theorist and a security threat, now says under interim leader Christian Stocker that it prefers to reach a coalition deal with Kickl to holding a snap election. On Wednesday, however, Stocker said he demanded assurances from Kickl that he wants to keep Austria free from Russian interference — a reference to FPO positions including opposing sanctions against Moscow over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Support for the FPO has only increased since September, polls show, and the party now has a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the OVP. 'We are entering negotiations with the FPO,' the OVP said in a statement minutes before the FPO's, confirming that Kickl and Stocker had held initial discussions and that the first issue would be the budget. 'For us, the most important cornerstones are Austria's sovereignty against foreign influence, especially from Russia, Austria as a reliable partner in the EU and our Western liberal democracy based on the rule of law,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-as-austria-far-right-led-coalition-talks-set-to-begin/7931300.html	2025-01-09T11:49:18-08:00

Swiss prisoner committed suicide in custody, Iran judiciary says	Iran’s judiciary said Thursday a Swiss citizen being held in the country’s Semnan prison has committed suicide. On the Iran judiciary's Mizon Online news website, Semnan Province Chief Justice Mohammad Sadeq Akbari is quoted as saying the Swiss citizen had been arrested for espionage and was being held in a suite with another prisoner. According to Akbari, the Swiss prisoner asked his cellmate to get him some food from the prison buffet and killed himself while he was alone. Akbari is quoted as saying, 'Prison officials immediately took action to save this person, but efforts to save him were unsuccessful.' The chief justice added, 'All evidence and documents from the place where this person is being held have been reviewed, and according to the documents, it is clear that he committed suicide.' There was no additional information provided regarding the identity of the prisoner or the manner of death. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards are known for arresting dual nationals and foreigners, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have criticized Iran for using such arrests to extract diplomatic concessions, a claim Tehran denies. Reuters news agency reports Switzerland plays an important intermediary role between Washington and Tehran as it represents U.S. interests in Iran and shares messages between the two countries. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-prisoner-committed-suicide-in-custody-iran-judiciary-says/7931195.html	2025-01-09T10:28:33-08:00	
World's largest dam to be built by China raises concerns in India, Bangladesh	NEW DELHI — China’s decision to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on a river that flows into India and Bangladesh has sparked concerns in both countries over the project’s potential impact on millions living downstream. Beijing last month approved the super dam’s construction — a new potential flashpoint between India and Beijing — on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet, which is known as the Brahmaputra River in India. The river plunges some 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) along a section called the 'Great Bend' before entering India, offering huge potential to generate power. China’s Xinhua news agency describes the development as 'a safe project that prioritizes ecological protection' and says it would play a major role in meeting the country’s carbon neutrality goals. But environmentalists in India have flagged concerns about the mega-project in an ecologically sensitive, mountainous region. They say harnessing the river could affect water flow in the country’s northeastern states and Bangladesh. According to estimates, the planned project would dwarf China’s Three Gorges Dam — the world’s largest — and generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. India is urging China to ensure interests of downstream states aren’t harmed by activities upstream. 'We will continue to monitor and take necessary measures to protect our interests,' Indian foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said last week. Defending its plans, China says the decision to build the dam was made after rigorous scientific evaluation. 'The project will not have a negative impact on the ecological environment, geological conditions and the rights and interests related to water resources of downstream countries,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said earlier this week in response to India’s concerns. Experts in India and Bangladesh, however, are raising questions about the project. 'The region proposed for dam construction is highly susceptible to landslides and is located on a geological fault line that intersects the Yarlung Zangbo,' said Y. Nithiyanandam, head of the Geospatial Research Programme at the Bengaluru-based Takshashila Institution. 'Planning a dam of this magnitude in such complex terrain poses significant risks to downstream regions of India and Bangladesh, especially in the event of a mishap or if there is alteration in the water flow.' The recent earthquake in Tibet that killed at least 126 people has highlighted the region’s vulnerability to such natural disasters, he said. 'This is a critical reminder to reassess the proposal for building a mega-dam in such an environment.' The proposed project’s proximity to a heavily militarized border along India’s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state, which Beijing has renamed 'South Tibet' and claims as its own, is another point of concern. Relations between India and China witnessed a thaw last October after both sides withdrew troops from two contested border areas. But analysts say a lingering mistrust underlies the project. 'The Indian government is on alert,' Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said Tuesday when asked about the Chinese project, according to the Press Trust of India. Indian foreign ministry spokesman Jaiswal said New Delhi had reiterated the need 'for transparency and consultation with downstream countries.' Some analysts say China’s failure to share details, such as environmental impact assessments about the project, exacerbate concerns. 'China acts unilaterally on issues related to trans-boundary rivers that originate in their territory. India, for example, has a treaty with Pakistan for common rivers that flow in both countries,' said Srikanth Kondapalli, professor of Chinese Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University. 'There are also questions as to why a dam is being built in a fragile area so close to an area that is contested between the two countries.' Other analysts point to dams along the Mekong River, which flows from China into Southeast Asia. The dams have led to water scarcity in downstream countries, a fact that Beijing denies. 'When the river crosses two or three countries, it becomes important for them to have a joint look at the project and come to a joint conclusion about how it is to be managed,' said Brigadier Arun Sahgal, senior fellow at the Delhi Policy Group. 'It is especially important because, in this case, having a dam so close to the border creates a mutual vulnerability for both India and for China.' India has also planned a dam on the Brahmaputra River that it hopes will help offset the impact of China’s hydropower project. 'The Siang dam will be our counter to the Chinese mega-dam. This is a matter of national security,' Arunachal Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein told reporters on Monday. China’s planned super dam has also raised worries in Bangladesh — where the river flows beyond India — that tens of thousands living along riverbanks could be affected if downstream flow is reduced. 'There would be a huge negative impact in Bangladesh,' said Malik Fida Khan, executive director of the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services in Dhaka. 'If there is an obstruction in the flow of the river, it could create water scarcity as well as the flow of nutrient-rich sediment, creating an ecological imbalance,' he said. 'Riverbank erosion could increase, and this will impact the lives of marginal communities as well as other economic activities in the area.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-largest-dam-to-be-built-by-china-raises-concerns-in-india-bangladesh/7931076.html	2025-01-09T08:40:06-08:00	
Chad investigates failed attack on presidential palace	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian troops were heavily deployed around the capital, N’Djamena, Thursday as officials said they were investigating a failed attack on the country’s presidential palace. Government troops foiled an attack by 24 heavily armed assailants on Wednesday night, officials said. President Mahamat Idriss Deby was in the palace at the time, they said, but is in good health. Eighteen attackers were killed on the spot, and the body of one attacker was found Thursday morning on the city’s streets, the military reported, adding that one member of the presidential guard died in the assault and two others were injured. Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah told state TV that some 10 suspects were arrested. Koulamallah said that the reason for the attack is still undetermined but that it had nothing to do with a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Wang met with Deby hours earlier in the palace to discuss increased economic and military ties. The attack took place after Chad's government on Wednesday reiterated an order, first issued last month, for French troops stationed in the country to leave by Jan. 31. The reiteration followed remarks this week by French President Emmanuel Macron that African countries were ungrateful for France's role in helping to fight jihadist insurgencies. In response, Deby said that Chad is not benefiting much from military agreements with Paris and that the order for French troops to leave was irreversible and nonnegotiable. Government officials said reports on social media that the attack was carried out by armed groups that benefit from the presence of French troops and oppose military ties between Chad and China are unfounded. The unusual presence of large numbers of government troops, tactical vehicles and armored cars unsettled some residents of N’djamena, but Chadian state TV advised people to remain calm. The message, broadcast several times Thursday, said people should go about their daily activities without fear. Regardless, 27–year-old food seller Maimouna Yebgi said the presence of government troops on the streets scared people. Yebgi suggested that the troops would be better placed in villages outside the city center where the armed gangs that attacked the palace may be hiding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-investigates-failed-attack-on-presidential-palace/7931010.html	2025-01-09T08:10:38-08:00

New York's highest appeals court declines to block Trump's sentencing in hush money case	ALBANY, NEW YORK — New York's highest court on Thursday declined to block Donald Trump's upcoming sentencing in his hush money case, leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as the president-elect's likely last option to prevent the hearing from taking place Friday. One judge of the New York Court of Appeals issued a brief order declining to grant a hearing to Trump's legal team. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to call off Friday's sentencing. His lawyers turned to the nation's highest court Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump's trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump has denied wrongdoing. In a filing to the top New York court, Trump's attorneys had said Merchan and the state's mid-level appellate court both 'erroneously failed' to stop the sentencing, arguing that the Constitution requires an automatic pause as they appeal the judge's ruling upholding the verdict. While Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or probation, Trump's lawyers argued a felony conviction would still have intolerable side effects, including distracting him as he prepares to take office. Trump's attorneys have argued that the Manhattan trial violated last summer's Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from prosecution over acts he took as president. At the least, they have said, the sentencing should be delayed while their appeals play out on the immunity issue. Judges in New York have found that Trump's convictions related to personal matters rather than official acts. Trump's attorneys called the case politically motivated, and said that the sentencing threatens to disrupt the Republican's presidential transition as he prepares to return to the presidency on Jan. 20. Sentencing Trump now would be a 'grave injustice,' his attorney D. John Sauer wrote. Sauer is also Trump's pick to be solicitor general, who represents the government before the high court. The emergency motion to the U.S. Supreme Court was submitted to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who hears emergency appeals from New York.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-s-highest-appeals-court-declines-to-block-trump-s-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-/7930968.html	2025-01-09T07:47:56-08:00	
UN accuses Russia of waging war of attrition against Ukraine	GENEVA — U.N. human rights experts have accused Russia of waging a war of attrition against Ukraine by pursuing a policy of mass destruction to crush the spirit of the nation. A report issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, Wednesday says that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, there has been 'a dangerous escalation of hostilities,' which has had a huge, injurious impact 'on the civilian population.' U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif, who presented the report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, told the 47- member body that 'September, in fact, marked the highest number of civilian casualties since July 2022.' Most civilian casualties, she said, were caused by 'relentless attacks with aerial glide bombs, long-range missiles, and drones that contributed to the killing of some 574 civilians — an increase of 30% over the previous year.' 'Russian bombardment damaged civilian infrastructure and water, heating and transportation services, including four major attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure since mid-November,' she said. The report covers the period from Sept. 1 to Nov. 30, 2024. It documents continued and increasing gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of humanitarian law, 'including possible war crimes.' 'We are deeply concerned by the impacts on civilians of the increased use of drones and the use of new weapons during the reporting period,' said Al-Nashif. 'Russian armed forces launched some 2,000 long-range drones in November alone, killing scores of people,' she said. 'We are also concerned about the potential increased use of anti-personnel landmines, due to the threats they pose to civilians, both now and long into the future.' The report documents 'credible allegations' of executions of Ukrainian military personnel captured by Russian armed forces, noting that 'summary executions constitute a war crime.' The OHCHR has verified the execution of 68 Ukrainian POWs captured by Russian armed forces. The office also has verified the summary executions of 170 civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, including in places of detention. 'Accountability for all of these killings is essential. Instead, there is almost total impunity,' Al-Nashif said. The 26-page report also documents torture of POWs at the hands of Russian and Ukrainian armed forces, calling it 'a violation of international law.' However, the report says the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war carried out by Russian armed forces is far worse than it is for those captured by Ukrainian military personnel. It describes the torture of Ukrainian men and women POWs by Russia subjected to severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence and other abuse as 'widespread and systematic.' While Russian prisoners of war held by Ukraine also 'were subjected to torture and ill-treatment, from severe beatings to sexual violence and dog attacks,' the report notes the abuse occurred mostly in places of transit before reaching official places of internment. 'The high commissioner’s report lays bare the harrowing reality of Russia’s war against human rights and fundamental freedoms in Ukraine,' said Filipenko Yevheniia, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. 'In the dead of winter, Russia has calculated strikes on power grids, water systems and heating infrastructure. They have left millions freezing in their homes, struggling without electricity or clean water,' she said in a statement. 'These are not unintended consequences. These are deliberate acts of terror calculated to spread suffering, target the most vulnerable, and shatter the spirit of the nation,' she said. Russia’s representative at the council sharply criticized what he called 'the selective nature and the bias of the U.N.’s pseudo human rights defender in chief' who, he said produced a report that 'hypocritically whitewashed the crimes' and numerous human rights violations in Ukraine. 'If you are so desperate to talk about Russia, then you should write about the daily shelling of Donetsk and Belgorod, of atrocities committed by Ukrainian thugs and Kursk terrorist acts on homes in various Russian regions,' said Evgeny Ustinov, first counsellor at the Russian Federation’s Permanent Mission in Geneva. 'The OHCHR clearly does not want to speak about the blatant discrimination against Russia and Russian speakers in Ukraine or about the harsh censorship, elimination of dissenters, extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention … and crimes committed by Ukrainians against peaceful civilians in Russian cities in the Donbas, Bucha, Belgorod and other oblasts of our country,' he said. The U.S. representative disagreed with this assessment, describing the OHCHR’s documentation of Russia’s violations and abuses against Ukraine as 'exemplary.' 'Next month will mark a cruel milestone, three years of Russia’s unjust and unprovoked war in Ukraine,' said Michele Taylor, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council. 'In those three years, we have seen Russia’s forces commit war crimes, and with other Russian officials, crimes against humanity,' she said, adding that 'Russia must answer for all of its reprehensible and unlawful actions.' Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the OHCHR said, more than 12,300 civilians have been killed, including over 650 children, and more than 27,800 people have been injured. It said more than 700 medical facilities and 1,500 schools and colleges have been damaged or destroyed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-russia-of-waging-war-of-attrition-against-ukraine/7930919.html	2025-01-09T07:44:27-08:00	
Clock ticking on US TikTok ban	A look at some of the most popular short videos on the TikTok social media platform may prompt head-scratching about what the fuss is. There is Charli D’Amelio (nearly 156 million followers) from the state of Connecticut, dancing in an 11-second clip to a remix of a Chris Brown song. There is a smiling baby having her cheeks squeezed (400 million views). And a video clip has racked up 2.3 billion views of California illusionist Zach King riding a 'magic broomstick.' Any day now, the billions of comedy skits, dance challenges, life hacks, and cute pets and babies on TikTok could become invisible in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has fast-tracked oral arguments on a challenge by the Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to a new U.S. law that would ban the social media platform on grounds of national security. While TikTok, the most popular social media platform in the United States, has become a part of American culture, its Chinese ownership has alarmed government officials and lawmakers. Beijing’s potential access to all that personal data and the ability to shape public opinion for its American users prompted Congress to ban it, with a 352-65 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives last March. That happened despite TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew’s appeal to American users to fight the legislation. 'Protect your constitutional rights. Make your voices heard,' Chew, a Singaporean with a Harvard MBA, said in a TikTok video prior to the congressional action. TikTok has repeatedly stated it has ensured the data of its American users is protected from outside influence and manipulation. Parent company ByteDance has more than 150,000 employees globally, including U.S. offices in Austin, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. Barring a reprieve by the Supreme Court, ByteDance will lose access to its largest market on Jan. 19. 'Assuming the Supreme Court upholds the law — unless the Trump administration can find some workaround, which I’m doubtful they’ll be able to — the choice is either sell TikTok or face a ban in the United States,' Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law, told VOA. Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had backed the ban. But Trump expressed a recent change of heart after his campaign videos during last year’s election performed well on the platform. 'They brought me a chart, and it was a record. It was so beautiful to see. And as I looked at it, I said, ‘Maybe we got to keep this sucker around for a little while,’' Trump said during an appearance in Phoenix in December. The Supreme Court will listen to the social media company’s appeal on Friday. The justices will weigh the national security argument against the constitutional guarantee of free speech for ByteDance’s American subsidiary and its estimated 170 million users in the United States. 'That’s one dimension of the conflict. But in another sense, it’s also a fight within free speech itself, because one thing the government is arguing is that one of the dangers of having Chinese ownership of TikTok is that the Chinese government would be able to manipulate the algorithm and therefore distort the speech environment itself,' explained Rozenshtein, who is also a senior editor at Lawfare, an online site that analyzes complicated legal and policy issues related to U.S. national security. Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary said he has informed Trump that he’s nearing a deal to buy the U.S. assets of TikTok that would save it from being banned. 'I wanted to let him know, as well as others in his Cabinet, that we’re doing this, and we’re going to need their help,' O’Leary, best known as one of the hosts of the reality TV program Shark Tank, told Fox News. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to put the case on hold so he can negotiate a sale of the platform following his second inauguration on Jan. 20 —- the day after the ban is set to go into effect. In the meantime, another sharing app owned by ByteDance — Lemon8 — is sponsoring posts on TikTok encouraging users to migrate there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clock-ticking-on-us-tiktok-ban/7930942.html	2025-01-09T07:28:15-08:00	
Lebanon's parliament chooses army commander Aoun as president, ending long deadlock	Beirut — Lebanon's parliament voted Thursday to elect the country's army commander, Joseph Aoun, as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum. The vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon's leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction. Aoun, no relation to former president Michel Aoun, was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild. The session was the legislature's 13th attempt to elect a successor to Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, clearing the way for the army chief. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that the military and political weakening of Hezbollah following its war with Israel and the fall of its ally, Assad, in Syria, along with international pressure to elect a president paved the way for Thursday's result. In a first round of voting Thursday, Aoun received 71 out of 128 votes but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for 'sovereignty and the constitution.' In the second round, he received 99 votes. Lebanon's fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite. However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. Joseph Aoun is the fifth former army commander to ascend to Lebanon's presidency, despite the fact that the country's constitution prohibits high-ranking public servants, including army commanders, from assuming the presidency during their term or within two years of stepping down. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun needed a two-thirds majority in the second round to clinch the election. Aoun, 60, was appointed army chief in March 2017 and had been set to retire in January 2024, but his term was extended twice during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. He kept a low profile and avoided media appearances and never formally announced his candidacy. Other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon's General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is in its sixth year of an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal. Slim, the analyst, said that 'the fact that [Aoun] has the backing of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the Europeans give him a big boost in terms of being able to get things done,' Slim said. But he will still have to 'navigate the contradiction that are inherent in domestic Lebanese politics,' she said, including relations with Hezbollah, which is not only a militant group but a political party with a strong base of support. Aoun 'has never had a conflictual relationship with Hezbollah, but he has also never acquiesced to Hezbollah,' Slim said. The army commander's relative lack of experience with economic matters means he will likely lean heavily on his advisors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-parliament-chooses-army-commander-aoun-as-president-ending-long-deadlock/7930857.html	2025-01-09T06:57:35-08:00

Militants kidnap 16 government employees in northwest Pakistan	Islamabad — Police and security officials in northwestern Pakistan said Thursday that militants have abducted at least 16 government workers and set unclear demands for their release. The group of civilian hostages are employees of a mining project related to the state-run Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in the militancy-hit Lakki Marwat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The men were commuting to work on a minibus when they were ambushed and taken hostage at gunpoint, area police officer Mohammad Ijaz said. The kidnappers then set the vehicle on fire before fleeing with the captives. The outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, reportedly took responsibility for the kidnapping and released a video featuring the abducted workers. Some of the hostages were seen urging authorities to ensure their safe release by complying with the militant demands but did not elaborate further. VOA could not independently verify the militant claims or the authenticity of the video. Officials say the PAEC is tasked with promoting and conducting research on the peaceful applications of atomic energy in agriculture, medicine, industry, and development projects related to nuclear power stations and electric power generation. Several districts, including Lakki Marwat, in the Pakistani province bordering Afghanistan, routinely experience TTP attacks targeting security forces and government officials. Thursday’s kidnapping came a day after heavily armed separatist militants in Pakistan’s sparsely populated southwestern Balochistan province briefly seized a government office, robbed a bank, and vandalized a police station in a remote district. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, claimed responsibility for staging the attack that officials said did not cause casualties. The natural resources-rich, largest Pakistani province has experienced a spike in BLA-led insurgent attacks in recent months. The insurgents claim to be fighting for the independence of Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan. Islamabad claims that TTP and Baloch insurgents operate from safe havens in Afghanistan, and their attacks have intensified since the Islamist Taliban took power in the neighboring country in 2021. However, the de facto authorities in Kabul deny the existence of foreign militant groups within their borders, asserting that they do not allow anyone to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil. The TTP is designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations. Recent U.N. security assessments have described the TTP as the 'largest terrorist' group in Afghanistan, with up to 6,000 fighters. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kidnap-government-employees-in-northwest-pakistan/7930878.html	2025-01-09T06:32:34-08:00	
Zelenskyy urges coalition aiding Ukraine not to 'drop the ball’	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Thursday called it 'crazy to drop the ball now' and end support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. 'It's clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now,' Zelenskyy told the Ukraine Defense Contact Group during opening remarks in Ramstein Germany, referring to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. 'We have to cooperate even more, rely on one another even more and achieve even greater results together,' he said. 'No matter what’s going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased of the map.' As Ukrainians fight continuing Russian assaults, international support for their fight is uncertain. Trump has not indicated whether he will continue America's leadership of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group when President Joe Biden leaves office January 20. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the group of about 50 nations has provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than half of the group's aid. The group came together under U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's leadership to coordinate security assistance after the invasion. Austin on Thursday announced a $500 million in additional weapons and equipment for Kyiv, which officials say will be the final military aid package before Biden leaves office. He said the package includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more artillery ammunition, more air-to-ground munitions and equipment to support Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets. The additional U.S. weapons and equipment are being pulled from the Pentagon’s existing military stockpiles. Austin, who is hosting the group for the last time, said leading the group has been 'one of the great honors of my life.' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius thanked Austin for his leadership on behalf of the allies and partners present. 'Your personal dedication has made a major difference. Without you, your commitment and your leadership. Ukraine's fight for freedom would not have yielded the same results,' he told Austin. Austin and defense analysts have warned that failing to continue coordinated support for Ukraine could prove catastrophic. 'If tyrants learn that aggression pays, we will only invite even more aggression, chaos and war, but we are still determined to not let that happen,' Austin told the group. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis 'on his record.' 'If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine, then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine,' he told VOA. Rather than cut Kyiv's lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration 'to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position' ahead of any peace negotiations. There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can't send that aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to restock its own supplies. While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high point of Austin's legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have hampered Ukraine's fight. Bowman said that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the Biden administration told them no and then maybe before finally saying yes. 'During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying and the delay being costly,' he said. Officials said the administration hopes the latest aid package, along with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden leaves office. One notable exception, a senior defense official said, is a group of military vehicles that are still being refurbished to be used on the battlefield.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-urges-coalition-aiding-ukraine-not-to-drop-the-ball/7930885.html	2025-01-09T06:26:14-08:00

China aims to deepen Central Asia influence with new railway project	Washington — A major railway project connecting China and Central Asia is set to begin construction in July, after over two decades of negotiation. Spanning more than 400 kilometers, the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, or CKU, is planned to start in Kashgar City in China’s northwestern Xinjiang autonomous region, pass through the Torugart Pass into Kyrgyzstan, continue west through the Kyrgyz border city of Jalalabad, and end in the eastern Uzbek city of Andijan, according to Chinese state media. Construction of the railway was stalled for more than 20 years by financing and technical issues and attempts by Russia and Kazakhstan to dissuade Beijing from funding the project, some regional observers told VOA. However, analysts say regime changes in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan since 2016 and Russia’s Ukraine war have paved the way for the three countries to agree on starting the construction. While Uzbekistan had been concerned with some of the issues that had come up with the project, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's government 'is opening up to the project since it has been something that Uzbekistan has been planning for decades,' said Temur Umarov, a Central Asia specialist at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, in Berlin. He said Kyrgyzstan was 'skeptical' about the CKU under the previous administration because some political elites benefited from Kyrgyzstan’s geographic advantage of being between China and other Central Asian countries that do not border China. These people would 'sell some products from China to those Central Asian countries,' he told VOA by phone. 'But the current Kyrgyz president, Sadyr Japarov, has talked about the project since his early days in office and it is one of the most important political projects to his presidency,' Umarov added. In addition to the Uzbek and Kyrgyz governments’ changing attitudes, other experts say the Ukraine war has prompted China and Central Asian countries to seek new transit routes to Europe. Landlocked Central Asia’s trade mainly goes through Russia and most of China’s trade with Europe under its Belt and Road Initiative also goes through Russia, Edward Lemon, a China-Central Asia relations specialist at Texas A&M University, said. 'All three countries are seeking alternatives, including greater trade among themselves and other routes via Iran and the Middle Corridor across the Caspian Sea. The railway forms part of those routes,' he told VOA in a written response. The Middle Corridor refers to the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route that starts in Turkey and passes through the Caucasus region, the Caspian Sea, Central Asia and Western China. It is the shortest route between western China and Europe. The railway project is one of several railway projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, a global infrastructure project including more than 150 countries and 32 international organizations. In Southeast Asia, China is trying to build the Kunming–Singapore Railway, also known as the Pan-Asia Railway, which would include three routes linking Kunming to Singapore via Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia through connections with previously existing rail lines in those countries. Under the current plan for CKU, China will build the Chinese section of the railway, and Uzbekistan will focus on upgrading its section. A joint venture authorized by the three countries, CKU Railway Co., will help finance and build the Kyrgyz section of the railway. Leaders from China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan praised the project prospects last month. During a Dec. 27 commencement ceremony in the Kyrgyz city of Jalalabad, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his congratulatory letter that the CKU should be made into a 'new demonstration project for Belt and Road cooperation' that would 'contribute to the economic and social development and the improvement of people's well-being in the region.' Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sadyr Japarov, who attended the ceremony, described the project as 'a strategic bridge' that will 'strengthen inter-regional ties' and enhance Central Asia’s competitiveness as an international transport and transit hub. In his remarks, read by Deputy Prime Minister for Trade and Investment Jamshid Khodjaev, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said CKU would 'further expand multifaceted cooperation and strengthen the strategic partnership among our countries.' Umarov said Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan could both benefit from the CKU. 'Uzbekistan used to rely on Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as the middlemen in trade with China but now with the railway, it would be much easier for them to export products to the Chinese market,' he told VOA. 'Kyrgyzstan could use the project to resolve its domestic connectivity issues and this will lead to growing economic opportunities in the cities that the railway would go through,' he added. As for China, Umarov thinks the railway project could allow Beijing to 'be more present in Central Asia from the trade and economic perspective, which is part of Beijing’s strategy to deepen relations with countries in the region.' Some Chinese analysts say CKU could also play a crucial role in connecting Asia and Europe. Zhang Hong, a research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told China’s state-run tabloid Global Times that CKU 'represents a significant opportunity for enhancing cooperation between Asia and Europe, as it will probably offer the shortest route for transporting goods from China to Europe and the Middle East via the China-Europe freight train.' In addition to increasing presence in Central Asia, experts say China will try to use CKU to promote and advance the BRI, which has struggled to attract more countries. 'The current BRI projects in place are not doing well and some have been facing a lot of delays,' said Niva Yau, an expert on China-Central Asia relations at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. 'At such a time, signing on this project helps remind people what the BRI is about,' she told VOA by phone, adding that the initiation of CKU also helps maintain China’s image as a provider to Central Asia. Despite these benefits, Yau and Umarov both said there are still some problems facing construction of CKU. 'They are building a railway across mountains that requires drilling of tunnels and sophisticated technologies that only China has domestically,' Yau said. 'We're talking about a pathway in Kyrgyzstan, which does not even have [electricity] or waterways or any of those things. Various basic things have not even met the conditions yet,' she added. In addition to technical problems, Umarov said the project could make Kyrgyzstan overindebted to China. Kyrgyzstan’s debt to China is about one-third of its gross domestic product 'and relying more on Chinese investment on this big project will definitely be a big challenge for its economy,' he told VOA. Lemon said while China could boost its image in Central Asia through CKU, Russia may feel further excluded from the region once the project is completed. 'Central Asia’s dependence on Russia as a transit country for trade has been key to its leverage over the region. But in the end, as it is distracted with the war in Ukraine and in desperate need of allies in the region, there isn’t much [Russia] can really do about it,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-aims-to-deepen-central-asia-influence-with-new-railway-project/7930839.html	2025-01-09T06:01:04-08:00	
Why are students in Seychelles learning Mandarin and what's in it for China?	China has been on a building spree in the Seychelles, a small country in the Indian Ocean. But there’s more to the diplomatic push than bricks and mortar. Beijing has also been investing in education, as a soft power approach to the strategically located archipelago.

Beijing says EU imposed unfair trade barriers on Chinese firms	Beijing — China said Thursday that an investigation had found the European Union imposed unfair 'trade and investment barriers' on Beijing, marking the latest salvo in long-running commercial tensions between the two economic powers. Officials announced the probe in July after Brussels began looking into whether Chinese government subsidies were undermining European competition. Beijing has consistently denied its industrial policies are unfair and has threatened to take action against the EU to protect Chinese companies' legal rights and interests. The commerce ministry said Thursday that the implementation of the EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) discriminated against Chinese firms and 'constitutes trade and investment barriers.' However, it did not mention whether Beijing planned to take action in response. The two are major trade partners but are locked in a wide-ranging standoff, notably over Beijing's support for its renewables and electric-vehicle sectors. EU actions against Chinese firms have come as the 27-nation bloc seeks to expand renewable energy use to meet its target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But Brussels also wants to pivot away from what it views as an overreliance on Chinese technology at a time when many Western governments increasingly consider Beijing a potential national security threat. When announcing the probe, the ministry said its national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics had filed a complaint over the FSR measures. The 20-page document detailing the ministry's conclusions said their 'selective enforcement' resulted in 'Chinese products being treated more unfavorably during the process of export to the EU than products from third countries.' It added that the FSR had 'vague' criteria for investigating foreign subsidies, placed a 'severe burden' on the targeted companies and had opaque procedures that created 'huge uncertainty.' EU measures such as surprise inspections 'clearly exceeded the necessary limits,' while investigators were 'subjective and arbitrary' on issues like market distortion, according to the ministry. Companies deemed not to have complied with probes also faced 'severe penalties,' which placed 'huge pressure' on Chinese firms, it said. The European Commission on Thursday defended the FSR, saying it was 'fully compliant with all applicable EU and World Trade Organization rules.' 'All companies, regardless of their seat or nationality, are subject to the rules,' a commission spokesperson said in a statement. 'This is also the case when applying State aid or antitrust rules.' Projects curtailed The Chinese commerce ministry said FSR investigations had forced Chinese companies to abandon or curtail projects, causing losses of more than $2.05 billion. The measures had 'damaged the competitiveness of Chinese enterprises and products in the EU market,' it said, adding that they also hindered the development of European national economies and undermined trade cooperation between Beijing and Brussels. The EU's first probe under the FSR in February targeted a subsidiary of Chinese rail giant CRRC, but closed after the company withdrew from a tender in Bulgaria to supply electric trains. A second probe targets Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers seeking to build and operate a photovoltaic park in Romania, partly financed by European funds. In October, Brussels imposed extra tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars after an anti-subsidy investigation under a different set of rules concluded Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. Beijing in response announced provisional tariffs on brandy imported from the EU, and later imposed 'temporary anti-dumping measures' on the liquor. Last month, China said it would extend the brandy investigation, citing the case's 'complexity.' Separately, a report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China warned that firms were being forced to drastically localize their operations to suit China's regulations, driving up costs and reducing efficiency. Heightened trade tensions and Beijing's 'self-reliance policies' were causing many multinationals 'to separate certain China-based functions, or even entire operations, from those in the rest of the world,' it said. It added that governance rules increasingly dominated by national security concerns had heightened uncertainties for local entities in engaging with European clients. Some customers are therefore choosing to 'err on the side of caution and not take a risk by buying from a foreign service provider,' Chamber head Jens Eskelund said at a media event on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-says-eu-imposed-unfair-trade-barriers-on-chinese-firms/7930784.html	2025-01-09T05:06:39-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's woodworking, painting and poetry reveal introspective Renaissance Man	PLAINS, Ga. — The world knew Jimmy Carter as a president and humanitarian, but he also was a woodworker, painter and poet, creating a body of artistic work that reflects deeply personal views of the global community — and himself. His portfolio illuminates his closest relationships, his spartan sensibilities and his place in the evolution of American race relations. And it continues to improve the finances of The Carter Center, his enduring legacy. Creating art provided 'the rare opportunity for privacy' in his otherwise public life, Carter said. 'These times of solitude are like being in another very pleasant world.' ‘One of the best gifts of my life’ Mourners at Carter’s hometown funeral will see the altar cross he carved in maple and collection plates he turned on his lathe. Great-grandchildren in the front pews at Maranatha Baptist Church slept as infants in cradles he fashioned. The former president measured himself a 'fairly proficient' craftsman. Chris Bagby, an Atlanta woodworker whose shop Carter frequented, elevated that assessment to 'rather accomplished.' Carter gleaned the basics on his father’s farm, where the Great Depression meant being a jack-of-all-trades. He learned more in shop class and with Future Farmers of America. 'I made a miniature of the White House,' he recalled, insisting it was not about his ambitions. During his Navy years, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter chose unfurnished military housing to stretch his $300 monthly wage, and he built their furniture himself in a shop on base. As president, Carter nurtured woodworking rather than his golf game, spending hours in a wood shop at Camp David to make small presents for family and friends. And when he left the White House, West Wing aides and Cabinet members pooled money for a shopping spree at Sears, Roebuck & Co. so he could finally assemble a full-scale home woodshop. 'One of the best gifts of my life,' Carter said. Working in their converted garage, he previewed decades of Habitat for Humanity work by refurbishing their one-story house in Plains. He also improved his fine woodworking skills, joining wood without nails or screws. He also bought Japanese carving tools, and fashioned a chess set later owned by a Saudi prince. Not just any customer Carter frequented Atlanta’s Highland Woodworking, a shop replete with a library of how-to books and hard-to-find tools, and recruited the world’s preeminent handmade furniture maker, Tage Frid, as an instructor, Bagby said. Still hanging near the store entrance is a picture of Frid, who died in 2004, teaching students including a smiling former president at the front of the class. 'He was like a regular customer,' Bagby said, other than the 'Secret Service agents who came with him.' Carter built four ladder-back chairs out of hickory in 1983, and Sotheby’s auctioned them for $21,000 each at the time, the first of many sales of Carter paintings and furniture that raised millions to benefit The Carter Center. It was rarely about the money, though. Jill Stuckey, a longtime friend who would have the Carters over to her home in Plains, recalled seeing the former president carrying out one of her chairs. 'I said, ‘What are you doing?’' she recalled. 'He said, ‘It’s broken. I’m going to take it home and fix it.’' He was at her back door at 7:30 the next morning, holding her repaired chair. Carter compared woodworking to the results of his labor as a Navy engineer, or as a boy on the farm: 'I like to see what I have done, what I have made.' ‘No special talent,’ but his paintings drive auctions Carter employed a folk-art style as a late-in-life amateur painter and claimed 'no special talent,' but a 2020 Carter Center auction drew $340,000 for his painting titled 'Cardinals,' and his oil-on-canvas of an eagle sold for $225,000 in 2023, months after he entered hospice care. Carter’s work hangs throughout the center’s campus. A room where he met with dignitaries is encircled with birds he painted after he and Rosalynn took on bird watching as a hobby. Near the executive offices are a self-portrait and a painting of Rosalynn in their early post-presidential years, hanging across from a trio of Andy Warhol prints showing Carter in office. Carter’s earliest years predominate, with boyhood farm scenes and portraits of influential figures like his father James Earl Carter Sr., whose death in 1953 led him to abandon a Navy career and eventually enter politics in Georgia. Some of his subjects, including both of his parents, are looking away. Carter's likeness of his mother shows 'Miss Lillian' as a 70-year-old Peace Corps volunteer in India. Jason Carter said the piece was particularly meaningful to his grandfather, who lost reelection at a relatively youthful 56. 'When he got out of the White House, she was standing there saying, ’Well, I turned 70 in the Peace Corps. What are you going to do?' Jason Carter said. One Carter subject who meets his gaze is a young Rosalynn — they married when she was 18 and he was 21. He described her as 'remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions.' Another who doesn’t look away is Rachel Clark, a Black sharecropper who had hosted the future president after they worked in the fields. 'Except for my parents, Rachel Clark was the person closest to me,' Carter wrote of his childhood. ‘Just a word of praise’ Carter wrote more than 30 books — even a novel — but was most introspective in poetry. On his first real recognition of Jim Crow segregation: 'A silent line was drawn between friend and friend, race and race.' On his Cold War submarine’s delicate dance with enemies: 'We wanted them to understand ... to share our love of solitude ... the peace we yearned to keep.' Rosalynn’s smile, he gushed, silenced the birds, 'or may be I failed to hear their song.' Perhaps Carter’s most revealing poem, 'I Wanted to Share My Father’s World,' concerns the man who never got to see his namesake son’s achievements. He wrote that he despised Earl’s discipline, and swallowed hunger for 'just a word of praise.' Only when he brought his own sons to visit his dying father did he 'put aside the past resentments of the boy' and see 'the father who will never cease to be alive in me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-woodworking-painting-and-poetry-reveal-introspective-renaissance-man/7930760.html	2025-01-09T04:32:07-08:00	
Schools cancel classes across Southern US as another burst of winter storms move in	Dallas, Texas — Schools and buildings from Texas to Georgia were shut down Thursday or prepared to close ahead of freezing rain and snow forecast for much of the Southern U.S. as another burst of plunging temperatures and winter storms threatened to again snarl travel. Texas schools canceled classes for more than 1 million students in anticipation of icy and potentially dangerous conditions that could last into Friday. Closures also kept students home in Kansas City and Arkansas' capital, Little Rock, while Virginia's capital, Richmond, remained under a weather-related boil advisory. The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through the Los Angeles area, forcing residents to flee from burning homes through flames, ferocious winds and towering clouds of smoke. Texas braces for snow In the Dallas area, crews treated roads ahead of the expected Thursday arrival of about 5 to 10 centimeters of snow. Up to 12.7 centimeters was expected farther north near Oklahoma, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Greg Abbott said the state deployed emergency crews in advance and urged residents to avoid driving in bad weather if possible. Boston native Gina Eaton, who stocked up on groceries in Dallas ahead of the storm, said she has some trepidation sharing roads with drivers unaccustomed to ice and snow. 'Even if there is ice, I’m very comfortable driving in it,' Eaton said. 'It’s just other people that scare me.' Roads could be slick Friday as 75,000 fans were expected head to AT&T Stadium in Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. Arlington spokesperson Susan Shrock said crews will be ready to address any hazardous road conditions. Southern discomfort A mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain was expected along a stretch from New Mexico to Alabama. Forecasters said the heaviest amounts were likely in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The system was expected to push northeastward by Friday with heavy snow and freezing rain all the way to the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. As much as about 20 centimeters of snow could fall in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through Saturday, the weather service said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced the closure of some state offices on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said city offices would be closed, with employees working remotely. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan said he expected schools across the state to close Friday, although decisions will be made at the local level. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently, paradoxically, because of a warming world. The agricultural impact Some parts of Kansas have received nearly an entire year's average of snow over the past few days, hitting farmers and ranchers 'in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,' said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University. Calves are especially at risk and can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water In northern Florida, growers were most concerned about ferns that are cultivated for floral arrangements, with Valentine's Day only a month away.	https://www.voanews.com/a/schools-cancel-classes-across-southern-us-as-another-burst-of-winter-storms-move-in-/7930748.html	2025-01-09T04:14:45-08:00	
Palestinian health officials say Gaza death toll tops 46,000	Gaza’s Health Ministry reported 70 new deaths Thursday in the Israel-Hamas war, pushing the total number of Palestinians killed to more than 46,000 since the conflict began in October 2023. In addition to those killed, the ministry said more than 109,300 people have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count, but has said more than half the victims are women and children. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Egypt, Qatar and the United States are leading efforts to try to secure a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas with the release of hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday said a deal was 'very close,' and that he hopes to secure an agreement before President Joe Biden’s term ends on January 20. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left, but if we don’t, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire-hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration,' Blinken said. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-health-officials-say-gaza-death-toll-tops-46-000/7930745.html	2025-01-09T04:00:35-08:00	
Mozambique opposition leader returns from self-exile, police use tear gas on supporters	MAPUTO — Mozambique opposition leader Venancio Mondlane returned from self-exile on Thursday, defiantly claiming to have won a hotly contested October election, but security forces later used tear gas to disperse supporters who had gathered to greet him. The disputed Oct. 9 poll, which Mondlane says was rigged, has sparked demonstrations over the past few months in which hundreds of protesters have been killed in the southern African nation of 35 million. 'My return does not result from any political agreement. My return is a unilateral decision to be in Mozambique,' he told reporters at Maputo airport upon his return. 'I’m here to prove that I didn't leave Mozambique out of fear,' he said, ending a period of exile that began a few days after the vote, when Mondlane had said his life was in danger. Mondlane's return could further exacerbate protests which have continued sporadically since the electoral commission declared victory in mid-October for the candidate of the ruling Frelimo party, extending its half-century in power. The official winner of the presidential vote, Daniel Chapo, is to be sworn in next week, another potential flashpoint in Mozambique's political crisis. Chapo and Frelimo deny accusations of electoral fraud. Mondlane reiterated his view that he was the true winner of the election, despite officially only securing 20% of the vote. 'I, Venancio Mondlane, (am the) president elected by the Mozambicans,' he said at the terminal, holding a Bible. 'Not by the Constitutional Council, not by the national commission of elections, but by the genuine will of the people.' Tear gas Thousands of cheering supporters appeared near the airport to greet him, before riot police armed with tear gas moved in to disrupt the gathering. A Reuters witness said snipers were positioned on buildings around the air base. Civil society monitoring group Plataforma Decide has said at least 278 people died in post-election violence, which has also hurt businesses and disrupted border access with neighboring South Africa. Some people have fled to neighboring Malawi and Eswatini to escape the violence. Mozambique's top court confirmed in December Frelimo's election victory - despite multiple reports from observers that it was not free and fair - triggering a fresh round of protests. Frelimo has ruled Mozambique since the end of the war against Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, clinging on throughout a 15-year civil war that killed a million people before a 1992 truce.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-opposition-leader-returns-from-self-exile-police-use-tear-gas-on-supporters/7930726.html	2025-01-09T03:44:44-08:00	
South Sudan announces plan to resume oil production	Juba, South Sudan — South Sudan announced early this week its plan to produce at least 90,000 barrels of crude oil per day as the country resumes normal production. This comes after oil supply to international markets were cut off last February because of the ongoing conflict in Sudan. Ninety percent of South Sudan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from its rich fossil reserves. In the last 11 months, the country was unable to sell its oil to international markets after Sudan evoked the force majeure clause, which protected it from liability following the outbreak of conflict in Khartoum in early 2023. The ban was lifted on January 4, allowing neighboring South Sudan to resume production. Puot Kang Chol, South Sudan's minister of petroleum, said, 'With the force majeure having been officially lifted by the government of Sudan, through its letter dated the 4th 2025 and based on that, the Ministry of Petroleum and partners would like to declare that the kickoff date of resumption is tomorrow. This is basically to say our ‘D-Day’ that we have been waiting for is tomorrow, the 8th of January, 2025.' Chol is adamant that Juba will continue to pump more oil to the global market even as the work to replace fossil fuels with green energy picks up momentum. 'We will continue to produce. ... South Sudan, and not only South Sudan, the continent called Africa, will continue to use oil resources for its own survival,' he said. While Chol was making clear South Sudan’s position on clean energy, or lack of it, in Gudele, a suburb in the capital, Juba, Betty Yobu, a citizen, is battling a chronic heart condition due to prolonged exposure to toxic gases. Betty said she has been using charcoal stoves for the past six years at her restaurant which targets low-income earners. The continuous exposure to carbon monoxide gases has made her health deteriorate. 'I started feeling not OK, especially my chest. Because of the heavy work, no rest, my health became weak, and maybe I was thinking that it was because of the heavy work. I decided to go and see a doctor, and they found out that I started developing chest problems because of the firewood I was using, the charcoal. Then, I breathe in the carbon monoxide, and they affected my health,' she said. But Chol insists that Juba will use its resources for the betterment of its people. 'Now, we are faced with the reality, and the reality is, ‘I go hungry, have no food, I will die.’ We are faced with the reality that you have a woman who [has] no access to health care, and the only resource that you have that can allow you health care is the oil resources. We will not abandon it, because death is death,' he said. In 2022, then-Finance Minister Agak Achuil said that South Sudan’s oil had been sold until 2027, and that any revenue coming from the sale of crude oil was going toward the repayment of loans. Agak later said he was misquoted. He was fired by President Salva Kiir within a week. Environmentalists continue to criticize the oil sector. In 2018, South Sudan lawmakers accused the Dar Petroleum consortium operating blocks 3 and 7 of dumping chemicals near Bentiu, home to an oil block. 'For any operations to restart in block 3 and 7, I think all environmental safeguards must be put in place,' Joseph Africano Bartel, undersecretary of Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Despite the challenges that will come with the latest pronouncement of plans to resume oil production, Juba and Khartoum are optimistic that it will alleviate a significant financial burden for both governments. South Sudan, which is ranked third in sub-Saharan Africa for oil reserves, produces approximately 3.5 billion barrels annually.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-announces-plan-to-resume-oil-production/7930709.html	2025-01-09T03:33:38-08:00	
Lebanon's parliament trying again to pick a president	BEIRUT — Lebanon’s parliament convened Thursday to make yet another effort to elect a president, filling a vacuum that's lasted for more than two years. While 12 previous attempts have failed to choose a successor to former President Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022, there are indications that Thursday's vote may produce a head of state. The leading candidate is Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun, no relation to the former president. He is widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild after a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, apparently clearing the way for the army chief. Also Wednesday, the Lebanese Forces, which leads the main parliamentary bloc opposed to Hezbollah, endorsed Aoun. All 128 members of the legislature were present for the vote Thursday. Lebanon’s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. As a sitting army commander, Joseph Aoun is technically barred from becoming president by Lebanon's constitution. The ban has been waived before, but it means that Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun would need a two-thirds majority even in the second round. Other contenders include Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon’s General Security agency. Al-Baissary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. A president is needed to appoint a permanent prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is six years into an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-parliament-trying-again-to-pick-a-president/7930694.html	2025-01-09T02:56:28-08:00	
As South Korea's impeached president Yoon awaits fate, his party sees signs of revival	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A prolonged period of uncertainty over the fate of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and a botched attempt to arrest him are giving oxygen to his backers and reviving support for his troubled party. Yoon, suspended from duties after his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3 and under criminal investigation for possible insurrection, has for weeks been holed up inside his hilltop residence in Seoul, guarded by a small army of personal security staff. In a National Barometer Survey poll released on Thursday, 59% of respondents wanted him arrested, something investigators are determined to do even though they failed last week after a widely televised six-hour standoff with his security force. Some 37% said arresting Yoon was excessive. A similar split fell in favor of the Constitutional Court, currently considering lawmakers' decision to impeach Yoon, removing him permanently. Analysts say the prospects of Yoon returning to office are unclear but the hiatus has emboldened his supporters, scores of whom braved sub-zero temperatures to gather near his residence on Thursday morning. The weeks since Yoon's impeachment have also seen a recovery in support for his ruling People Power Party (PPP), which some analysts say shows signs conservatives are uniting to fight a possible presidential election later this year. 'It seems that the attempt to arrest Yoon has reinvigorated conservatives,' said Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. He said that revival comes from both die-hard Yoon supporters, who back his reasons for declaring martial law, including unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud, and those less supportive of Yoon but concerned at the prospect of Lee Jae-myung, the liberal leader of the main opposition party, becoming president. 'If the arrest effort had succeeded, these conservatives would have been defeated for a second time, following impeachment, and that reinvigoration would possibly have been snuffed out quickly. The more that arrest attempts fail, the stronger reinvigorated conservatives will feel,' said Richey. A Realmeter poll released on Monday put the PPP's approval rating at 34.4%, up for three consecutive weeks. The main opposition Democratic Party, which commands a parliamentary majority and brought on Yoon's impeachment vote, scored 45.2%. Most pollsters in South Korea have stopped tracking Yoon's approval ratings since he was impeached by parliament, although some fringe polls have shown a rise in his personal support in recent days. As he faces the prospect of another arrest attempt, his lawyers have remained defiant, alleging that the anti-corruption officers seeking his arrest do not have authority to investigate him for insurrection, even though a court has issued a warrant. The lawyers, however, told reporters on Thursday that the Constitutional Court's decision on Yoon's political future will be accepted. Rulings by the court, one of the two highest courts in the country along with the Supreme Court, cannot be appealed. 'The president is still staying strong. He said he doesn't want people to suffer and public officials to suffer from this, but he can't accept illegal investigations,' lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon, Yoon's confidant, told supporters outside his residence on Wednesday. Jeremy Chan, senior analyst covering Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group, a U.S.-based political risk consultancy, said further attempts to arrest Yoon would likely only 'galvanize' his support and that of his party. Yoon's supporters also draw inspiration from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and faced a litany of legal troubles but made a stunning comeback in an election last year. Some of Yoon's supporters have adopted the 'Stop the Steal' slogan popularized by Trump's proponents to ramp up fraud allegations against the election watchdog. Trump has not directly commented on Yoon's situation. Lee Jun-han, professor of political science at Incheon National University, said conservative voters were more probably driven by the memory of conservatives' heavy election defeat after the impeachment of president Park Geun-hye in 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-south-korea-s-impeached-president-yoon-awaits-fate-his-party-sees-signs-of-revival/7930693.html	2025-01-09T02:55:53-08:00	
Cambodian police arrest suspect in politician's Bangkok shooting	BANGKOK — Police in Cambodia arrested a former Thai marine on Wednesday over the fatal shooting of a Cambodian opposition politician in a brazen attack in downtown Bangkok. Exiled Cambodian opposition figurehead Sam Rainsy accused the country's powerful former leader Hun Sen of ordering the killing of Lim Kimya, who was also a French citizen. Lim Kimya was shot dead on Tuesday by a gunman on a motorbike as he arrived in the Thai capital from the Cambodian city of Siem Reap by bus, accompanied by his French wife. Thai police issued a warrant for the suspected shooter on Wednesday, and in the evening, Cambodia said the man had been detained at 1:50 p.m. in Battambang province, which borders Thailand. 'The gunman is a Thai national, and a former Thai marine,' Cambodian National Police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun told AFP. Cambodian police named the suspect as Ekkalak Pheanoi — though some Thai media gave his name as Ekkalak Paenoi — and said he would be returned to Thailand, without giving a timetable. Earlier, Sanong Sangmanee, police chief for the area of Bangkok where the shooting happened, told AFP they had little information about the suspect except that he worked as a motorbike taxi driver. Scores of Cambodian opposition activists have fled to Thailand in recent years to avoid alleged repression at home. Some were arrested and deported back to the country. Hun Sen ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for nearly four decades, with rights groups accusing him of using the legal system to crush opposition to his rule. He stepped down and handed power to his son Hun Manet in 2023 but is still seen as a major power in the kingdom. On Tuesday, Hun Sen called for a new law to label anyone who attempts to topple Hun Manet's government as 'terrorists.' 'Brutal act' Sam Rainsy, Hun Sen's long-time rival, accused the former Cambodian leader of being behind the killing. 'Hun Sen's hand can be seen behind the assassination of Lim Kimya, just as it has been behind the countless political crimes in Cambodia that have always gone unpunished,' Sam Rainsy said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. He alleged 'the motive is the same, as is the modus operandi.' Cambodian government spokesman Pen Bona told AFP the killing was in Thailand 'so Thai authorities will handle the case.' He denied the government was involved with the killing, saying opposition figures 'always accuse the government of everything groundlessly and without any evidence.' Lim Kimya became an opposition member of Cambodia's parliament following an election in 2013 in which Hun Sen's ruling party almost lost to its then-rival, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The CNRP, which was founded in 2012 by Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha and was once considered the sole viable opponent to the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), was dissolved by court order in 2017. Scores of opposition politicians and MPs, including Lim Kimya, were banned from political activities following the party's dissolution. The now-dissolved CNRP said in a statement it was shocked by 'the heinous and inhumane' killing of Lim Kimya. It condemned 'the brutal act that badly threatens political freedom.' Elaine Pearson, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, urged Thailand to carry out a 'thorough independent investigation' into the killing. 'What has happened in the last 24 hours really sends a chill down the spine for any Cambodian political activists that Bangkok is not a safe place,' she told AFP. The French embassies in Bangkok and Phnom Penh have so far declined to comment on the killing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-police-arrest-suspect-in-politician-s-bangkok-shooting/7930688.html	2025-01-09T02:48:32-08:00	
6 dead in Indian temple stampede as thousands jostle for free passes	HYDERABAD, INDIA — At least six people were killed and 35 injured in a stampede near one of India's busiest and richest temples, after thousands of devout Hindus assembled there to secure free visit passes, authorities said Thursday. The period from Friday to Jan. 19 is considered auspicious for visits to the deity at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple, popularly known as Tirupati, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the site of Wednesday's incident. 'The stampede took place when the gate was opened,' S. Venkateswar, the district collector, or top revenue official, told reporters on Thursday. 'About 2,500 people just pushed through the gate... a few fell.' Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the stampede, he added. Tickets for visits to the nearly 2,000-year-old temple usually cost 300 rupees, or $3.50, each and are sold online. A police complaint showed the incident occurred between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. local time, outside a school a few kilometers from the temple, where state authorities had set up counters to issue tickets. Video images showed police struggling to manage the crowd that had gathered, in clips by news agency ANI, in which Reuters holds a minority stake. People who started queuing early for the passes pushed and jostled each other, leading to the stampede, Venkateswar said, and about a dozen of the 35 injured who were taken to hospital were still being treated Thursday. Temple operator, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, apologized for the incident and promised action against anyone found responsible. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, a key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, inspected the stampede site and visited some of the injured in hospital. YSR Congress Party, the main opposition party led by Naidu's predecessor Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, blamed the state government for the incident, calling it an administrative failure. Modi offered condolences in a post on X, adding, 'My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-indian-temple-stampede-as-thousands-jostle-for-free-passes/7930679.html	2025-01-09T02:38:07-08:00	
Britain plans new sanctions laws to target people-smuggling gangs	LONDON — Britain will create a new sanctions regime to target the leaders of networks that smuggle tens of thousands of people into Britain each year, as well as the often-Chinese makers of the boats and motors they use, the government said Wednesday. Under huge political pressure to cut the numbers arriving in small boats from France, the government said the laws would complement other reforms. 'We will target those profiting off putting lives at risk, and disrupt the gangs' finances,' interior minister Yvette Cooper said in a statement. The policy was due to be the centerpiece of a speech by foreign minister David Lammy on Thursday, seeking to demonstrate coordination between the foreign and interior ministries. Lammy said Britain would pursue the makers of the boats used by migrant smugglers. He told Times Radio many of the manufacturers were from China. Asked by the BBC whether the government would sanction those businesses, Lammy said: 'Absolutely, because when you look at those boats, where do the engines come from? Where does the rubber come from?' The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government said the sanctions would be in place by the end of the year and enable authorities to ban those linked to people-smuggling from entering Britain, punish those trying to do business with them, and freeze assets. Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer was elected in July and immediately ditched the previous, Conservative government's plan to deport illegal migrants to Rwanda as a deterrent, instead switching focus to breaking up the gangs that organize crossings. Migrants from North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere pay thousands of pounds to traffickers for places in small inflatable boats that then try to cross one of the world's busiest shipping channels to reach the English coast. Over 36,800 people made the crossing in 2024, 25% more than the previous year, according to government data, while dozens have died in the attempt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-plans-new-sanctions-laws-to-target-people-smuggling-gangs-/7930672.html	2025-01-09T02:08:02-08:00	
Ukraine reports destroying 46 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 46 of 70 drones that Russian forces used in attacks targeting areas in central and eastern Ukraine. Falling debris from downed drones damaged houses in the Cherkasy, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukraine’s air defenses also shot down drones in the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Poltava and regions. The attacks came a day after Russian missiles struck the city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least 13 people and wounding 30 others. 'There is nothing more cruel than launching aerial bombs on a city, knowing that ordinary civilians will suffer,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down 15 Ukrainian drones, including over the Belgorod, Bryansk and Krasnodar regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram that drone debris damaged a home, but that there were no casualties from the Ukrainian attack.

Imprisoned Belarus activist resurfaces after being held incommunicado for 700 days	TALLINN, ESTONIA — An imprisoned opposition activist in Belarus resurfaced Wednesday in a video shot by a pro-government blogger after more than 700 days of no contact with his family, weeks before an election that is all but certain keep the country's strongman leader in power. Viktar Babaryka, 61, has been denied meetings with his family and lawyers while serving a 14-year sentence in a penal colony after failing to get on the ballot against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in a 2020 election. Babaryka was last heard from in February 2023, and other prisoners said later that year he was hospitalized with signs of beatings. Since then, authorities haven’t released any information about his condition and barred his lawyer from visits. The European Parliament has urged authorities to release him and other political prisoners. Raman Pratasevich, a former opposition journalist who later became a government supporter after being arrested himself, posted photos and a brief video in which Babaryka greeted his family. It wasn't clear when or under what conditions the images were taken, and The Associated Press could not independently verify them. Babaryka, who looked visibly thinner than in his last appearance, was pictured wearing a prison uniform bearing a yellow tag designating him as a political prisoner and thus subjecting him to particularly harsh prison conditions. Pavel Sapelka, a representative of the Viasna Human Rights Center, noted that the images were released ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential election, in which Lukashenko is seeking a seventh, five-year term to add to his more than three decades in power. 'The authorities decided to show Babaryka in the run-up to the election to avoid accusations of forced disappearance of opposition activists behind bars,' Sapelka said. 'The terribly emaciated Babaryka epitomizes the nightmare of repressions in Belarus, a sad reminder for others who dare to challenge Lukashenko.' In November, Pratasevich posted photos of Maria Kolesnikova, another prominent opposition activist who had been held for more than 20 months without any communication with relatives or friends. Babaryka is one of 1,258 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna, the country's leading human rights group. Top opposition figures were imprisoned or fled the country amid the sweeping crackdown that followed the 2020 election. Authorities responded to massive demonstrations protesting vote-rigging with brutal repressions in which about 65,000 people were arrested and thousands were brutally beaten by police. At least seven political prisoners have died in custody, according to Viasna. Like Babaryka, many other opposition activists have been held incommunicado. Lukashenko pardoned some political prisoners last year but authorities launched a new wave of arrests before the election, seeking to uproot any sign of dissent. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 vote, said she was happy to see Babaryka alive and demanded that authorities release information about others who have been held incommunicado, including her husband, activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski. 'We must now demand to see all others who have been held in complete isolation, and the cruel and inhumane incommunicado practice must stop,' she said. Pratasevich ran a Telegram messaging app channel widely used by participants in the 2020 protests. He was living in exile when he was arrested in 2021 after being pulled off a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania that was diverted to Minsk by a bomb threat. Once in custody, he made several confessional appearances on state television that critics claimed were made under duress. He was later released and pardoned. 'We consider Pratasevich a hostage. He’s doing all what is ordered by the Belarusian authorities,' Sapelka said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imprisoned-belarus-activist-resurfaces-after-being-held-incommunicado-for-700-days/7930665.html	2025-01-09T01:23:10-08:00	
Former President Jimmy Carter to be honored at Washington funeral	WASHINGTON — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is set to be honored Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral before being buried in his home state of Georgia. Carter’s living presidential successors – Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – are due to attend the Washington funeral, with Biden delivering a eulogy. Mourners from the public were able to pay their final respects overnight at the U.S. Capitol, where Carter’s casket lay in state since Tuesday. David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes. 'He had such an impact on so many people,' he said. 'His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me.' In the Capitol rotunda – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: 'Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man.' Vice President Kamala Harris – who on Monday in the Capitol certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy. 'He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy,' she said Tuesday. 'He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks.' Carter, who served as the 39th president, died Dec. 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral. At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them. Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was 'a real moral person.' 'He taught Sunday school – I did, too!' she said, smiling. 'But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president.' South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, 'President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country.' In late December, after receiving news of Carter’s death, Biden said, 'We may never see his like again. You know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter.' Analysts say the two men have a few things in common. 'There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,' Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. 'And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that.' When asked what Carter and Trump have in common, Galston paused. 'I don't even know how to begin to answer that question,' he said finally. 'The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as outsiders.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-president-jimmy-carter-to-be-honored-at-washington-funeral/7930646.html	2025-01-09T00:16:56-08:00

Thousands more ordered to evacuate as Los Angeles wildfires spread	More than 130,000 people in the Los Angeles area were under evacuation orders early Thursday as firefighters battled multiple major wildfires that already killed at least five people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures. A new, fast-moving fire broke out late Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills, prompting the latest round of orders for people to flee to safety. Meteorologists said the dry conditions and strong winds conducive to the breakout and spread of the fires are expected to remain in place through Friday. High wind gusts had forced the grounding of planes used to help fight the fires, but officials said Wednesday the winds had eased enough for those operations to resume. 'Tonight, we have very mild wind conditions where we can get aircraft and a ton of additional resources getting their hands around this fire,' Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. 'That’s what gives me confidence that we’re going to get a handle on this fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a federal emergency declaration for California to release federal money and resources to help battle the wildfires. The White House said late Wednesday that Biden canceled a planned trip to Italy so that he can 'remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead.' 'We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes, to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to normal. It’s going to be a hell of a long way,' Biden said Wednesday. 'It’s going to take time.' The Defense Department pledged to provide 'additional firefighting personnel and capabilities' to California. While authorities had warned of the potential for wildfires in the Los Angeles area given the conditions this week, the blazes were more extensive than anticipated. 'The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities,' L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday. In addition to the Hollywood area, there were active fires in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Sylmar. Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to spread. 'We have no percentage of containment,' Marrone said. Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters. In Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry. 'We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades,' said Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 'We pushed the system to the extreme.' The call for water was 'four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight,' she added. The fire in Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of L.A.

Ex-FBI informant who made up claims about Bidens sentenced to 6 years	WASHINGTON — A former FBI informant who admitted lying about U.S. President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden’s interactions with a Ukrainian energy company was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday, court records showed. Alexander Smirnov pleaded guilty last month of causing the creation of a false record after falsely telling his FBI handler that he had knowledge of bribes paid by executives at Burisma Holdings to Joe and Hunter Biden, according to court documents. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a role that has attracted years of scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. Smirnov also admitted tax evasion. Prosecutors working with special counsel David Weiss, who investigated matters related to Hunter Biden, had asked U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles to sentence Smirnov to six years in federal prison. 'The defendant decided in 2020 to exploit the position of trust he enjoyed with the FBI in order to provide false information about one of the candidates for president of the United States in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing, referring to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Lawyers for Smirnov sought a four-year prison sentence, arguing Smirnov had accepted responsibility and suffered a 'personal downfall' resulting from the case. Smirnov falsely claimed in conversations with the FBI that executives at Burisma told him in 2015 or 2016, while Joe Biden was vice president, that they'd hired Hunter Biden to 'protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.' Smirnov also fabricated a claim that Joe and Hunter Biden were each paid $5 million in bribes from Burisma executives, according to court documents. Republican lawmakers learned of an FBI record documenting Smirnov’s claims, which briefly became a focus of a since-abandoned effort to impeach Joe Biden. Weiss, the special counsel, also brought two criminal cases against Hunter Biden on tax and gun charges. Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son last month, ending both prosecutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-fbi-informant-who-made-up-claims-about-bidens-sentenced-to-6-years-/7930576.html	2025-01-08T19:10:14-08:00	
US to pledge $500M for Ukraine at Ramstein meeting	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — The United States is providing Ukraine with $500 million in additional weapons and equipment from its existing military stockpiles, in what officials told VOA will be the final military aid package before President Joe Biden leaves office. The officials were speaking to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement, which is expected Thursday when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hosts the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein, Germany, for the last time. 'Our focus will be on maintaining momentum, delivering results, and sending a clear message: The international community stands resolute in its support for Ukraine,' Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that he will join Austin at the 25th meeting of the group, which comprises about 50 nations that came together under Austin's leadership to coordinate security assistance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'They [Ukrainians] continue to survive, but they do that with the support of the U.S. and other allied countries and coalitions through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. And I think it's pretty clear that the Ukraine Defense Contact Group is, it's more than just a common understanding. It's a common cause,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Wednesday. As Ukrainians fight to survive, that common cause to support their fight is shrouded in uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump has not indicated whether he will continue America's leadership of the group when President Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, and current administration officials and defense analysts warn that could prove catastrophic for Kyiv. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis 'on his record.' 'If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine, then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine,' he told VOA. Rather than cut Kyiv's lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration 'to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position' ahead of any peace negotiations. There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can't send that aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to restock its own supplies. While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high point of Austin's legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have hampered Ukraine's fight. Bowman says that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the Biden administration told them 'no,' then 'maybe,' before finally saying, 'yes.' 'During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying and the delay being costly,' he said. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, the group of about 50 nations has provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than half of the group's aid. Officials said the administration hoped the latest aid package, along with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden left office. One notable exception, a senior defense official said, was a group of military vehicles that were still being refurbished to be used on the battlefield.

Biden administration sounds alarm about Sudan genocide	washington — The White House described Sudan’s civil war as a genocide Wednesday, a day after Washington placed sanctions on the nation’s rebel leader for his forces’ 'horrific, systematic atrocities' in a conflict that has gripped the nation for more than two years, killing tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes. 'This is the second genocide in a generation in Sudan,' said John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council. He was referring to the brutal Darfur conflict, in which Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militias used scorched-earth tactics on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa people of western Sudan, killing at least 200,000. The scale and horror of the violence prompted the International Criminal Court to issue its first-ever warrant for genocide to Sudan’s then-president, Omar al-Bashir. 'Just think about that for a second,' Kirby said. 'The second genocide in a generation in Sudan.' Kirby named Rapid Support Forces leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa as the leader of a wave of renewed ethnic cleansing, rape and systemic atrocities. Daglo, who is better known by his nickname, Hemedti, was a commander in the Janjaweed militia. He led the paramilitary RSF until an April 2023 clash with government forces that sparked the current conflict. The violence has plunged nearly 640,000 people in the oil-rich nation into famine, the State Department says. The United Nations estimates that 30 million people — more than half of Sudan’s population — need humanitarian assistance as a result. The U.S. sanctions target Hemedti, along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates and one other individual. Among other things, the State Department said in its announcement, the sanctions block Hemedti and his immediate family members from entering the United States. The Khartoum-based Sudan Times cited an adviser to Hemedti who said, on social media, that sanctions could hamper efforts to resolve the conflict. Rights groups applauded the sanctions. Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, called the State Department’s move 'the first step toward redefining U.S. policy in Sudan with accountability and civilian protection at the center.' She added, 'We hope to see more pressure from the United States on the parties to the conflict and U.S. allies to respond to past and ongoing atrocities and human suffering.' Brian Adeba, a senior adviser at The Sentry, a Washington-based investigative organization that tracks war crimes and human rights abuses, told VOA’s John Tanza that this was the strongest move Washington had made on Khartoum since conflict erupted in 2023. 'It is welcome, but a lot of work needs to be put into ensuring that the culprits that are committing the mass atrocities are held accountable,' he said. Adeba said it was significant that the U.S. sanctions also targeted seven Emirati firms seen to be supporting the RSF. 'And so, this one closes the loop. Not only does it target the perpetrator but also the enabler, and therefore it puts a lot of pressure on also the international community to take action against the RSF,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-sounds-alarm-about-sudan-genocide/7930555.html	2025-01-08T18:58:12-08:00	
US port strike averted as 45,000 union workers, employers reach deal	The union representing 45,000 dock workers on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts and their employers on Wednesday said they reached a tentative deal on a new six-year contract, averting further strikes that could have snarled supply chains and taken a toll on the U.S. economy. The International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance employer group, in a joint statement, called the agreement a win-win. The deal includes a resolution in automation, which had been the thorniest issue on the table. 'This agreement protects current ILA jobs and establishes a framework for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while modernizing East and Gulf coast ports – making them safer and more efficient and creating the capacity they need to keep our supply chains strong,' the groups said. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The talks had been extended until Jan. 15 to reach a deal on automation. Shipping industry executives, customers and analysts had been concerned that the parties would be unable to overcome their impasse, leading to a second ILA strike just days before President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A three-day ILA strike in October had triggered a surge in shipping prices and cargo backlogs at the 36 affected ports. Longshoremen returned to work after employers agreed to a 62% wage increase over the next six years.

Israel says it has recovered body of hostage in Gaza	JERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers recovered the body of a 53-year-old hostage in an underground tunnel in southern Gaza, the military said Wednesday, and the army was determining if another set of remains belongs to the man's son. The discovery of Yosef AlZayadni's body comes as Israel and Hamas are considering a ceasefire deal that would free the remaining hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza. Israel says about a third of the remaining 100 hostages have died but as many as half could be dead. Yosef and his son Hamzah AlZayadni were thought to still be alive before Wednesday's announcement, and news about their fate could ramp up pressure on Israel to move forward with a deal. The military said it found evidence in the tunnel that raised 'serious concerns' for the life of Hamzah AlZayadni, 23, suggesting he may have died in captivity. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the circumstances behind Yosef AlZayadni's death were being investigated. AlZayadni and three of his children were among 250 hostages taken captive after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people. AlZayadni had a total of 19 children and had worked for 17 years at the dairy farm of a kibbutz that was among the communities attacked, said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing the relatives of captives. AlZayadni's teenage children, Bilal and Aisha, were released along with about 100 hostages in a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. The bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. The Hostages Families Forum said the ceasefire deal being negotiated 'comes far too late for Yosef — who was taken alive and should have returned the same way.' 'Every day in captivity poses an immediate mortal danger to the hostages,' the group said in a statement. The deaths of previous high-profile hostages have sparked large protests in Israel calling for a deal. Yosef AlZayadni's name appeared on a list of 34 hostages shared by a Hamas official with The Associated Press earlier this week, who the militant group said were slated for release. Israel said this was a list it had submitted to mediators last July, and that it has received nothing from Hamas. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas is 'very close,' and he hopes 'we can get it over the line' before handing over U.S. diplomacy to President-elect Donald Trump's administration later this month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow at the news of AlZayadni's death and said in a statement he had 'hoped and worked to bring back the four members of the family from Hamas captivity.' The AlZayadni family are members of the Bedouin community, part of Israel's Palestinian minority who have Israeli citizenship. The traditionally nomadic community is particularly impoverished in Israel and has suffered from neglect and marginalization. Palestinians make up some 20% of Israel's 10 million population, and millions more live in Gaza and under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. Eight members of Israel's Bedouin minority were abducted in the October 2023 attacks. 'We expected to bring them back alive,' said Talal Alkernawi, mayor of the city of Rahat where the men were from. 'Instead of returning them alive to their families, to raise their children, we receive them dead.' Many families fear their loved ones' fate is at risk as long as the war in Gaza rages on. Israeli forces are pressing their air and ground war against Hamas, and Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least nine people in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including three infants — among them a 1-week-old — and two women. Israel's military says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-has-recovered-body-of-hostage-in-gaza/7930537.html	2025-01-08T18:01:49-08:00	
Experts: Russian technology could enhance North Korea's ICBM capabilities	WASHINGTON — Russian space technologies, if transferred to Pyongyang in compensation for its support of Moscow's war on Ukraine, could enhance North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities, U.S. experts say. 'The DPRK [North Korea] is already receiving Russian military equipment and training,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Monday in Seoul. 'Now, we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang.' According to U.S. defense officials, North Korea has deployed an estimated 12,000 troops to Russia, of which roughly 1,000 have already fallen casualty to fighting Ukrainians in Russia's Kursk region. For months, top diplomats and defense analysts have said North Korea anticipates Russian technical assistance for nuclear and missile programs in exchange. Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, suggested that any of Russia's technological assistance would likely aim to develop Pyongyang's ICBM program under the guise of non-military satellite programs, as solutions for space launch vehicles can be applied to ballistic missiles. 'It would be politically very challenging for Russia to announce that it is going to help North Korea with its ICBM program,' Peters told VOA's Korean Service on Tuesday. 'Russians are able to have this fig leaf of, 'Well, we're just helping North Korea with a satellite program.' But I don't think anyone's fooled by this.' According to Peters, two areas where North Korea could substantially benefit from Russia's space program: Accuracy and reliability, both of which are crucial for delivering nuclear warheads effectively. 'Getting the actual warhead package on target is no small task,' he explained. 'And the United States and also Russia has, over the past 35 years, figured out a way to get warheads on target in a way that was not possible during the Cold War.' Peters also said North Korean engineers have struggled with having warheads reliably survive reentry from space to produce yield. Vann Van Diepen, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation from 2009 to 2016, told VOA Korean that technologies related to satellite dispensing and maneuvering could enhance North Korea's ICBM program. 'If space launch vehicle technology or booster technology gets transferred as part of so-called 'space technology,' then that potentially could be applicable to probably liquid-propellant ICBMs,' Van Diepen said. Many satellites are known to use liquid propellants for efficiency and controllability. Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, also said satellite launch vehicles have components that could be adapted for North Korea's liquid-fueled ICBMs. 'Probably, that could be used in a liquid-fueled ICBM, giving it a longer range or a greater carrying capacity, so that it could carry more warheads,' Bennett told VOA Korean. The majority of North Korea's known ICBMs are believed to use liquid fuels. Looming threat Peters said Russia's assistance could pose a serious threat to the continental United States. 'The only reason for North Korea to build ICBMs is to target the United States, as they don't need ICBMs to target South Korea or Japan,' he said, adding that it could make East Asian allies question whether Washington, faced with a direct threat, could maintain its regional deterrence commitments. Even short of direct ICBM technology transfers, Van Diepen said enhanced North Korean satellite technology is detrimental to the U.S. and its allies. 'If Russia helps North Korea make better reconnaissance satellites — [with] higher resolution [imaging], that sort of thing — that improves North Korea's targeting ability and intelligence capability. And that, of course, is bad for the United States and for the alliance,' Van Diepen said. 'So, even without technology transfers that would help North Korea's ICBM program, it would still be a bad thing and something the United States would oppose.' In November 2023, North Korea announced it successfully launched a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit after two failed attempts. Seoul believes Russian support likely enabled that success, according to The Associated Press. Former U.S. defense intelligence officer Bruce Bechtol told VOA Korean that Pyongyang has been working to enhance satellite capabilities in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. 'The North Koreans put up a satellite before into orbit, but they need the specific technology that has intelligence collection on it, and that they would need to get from a benefactor, the Chinese or the Russians,' he said. 'It appears that they're getting it from the Russians, and that's disturbing.' China's stance China has been walking a fine line between the concern about Russia's possible transfer of missile technology to North Korea and its ties with Moscow and Pyongyang. 'North Korea and Russia are two independent sovereign states. How to develop bilateral relations is their own business,' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email to VOA Korean on Tuesday. On Monday, North Korea fired what it said was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile, which flew about 1,100 kilometers before landing in the sea off its east coast. The test launch was conducted two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to office. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, before nuclear talks between the two collapsed. Bennett and other experts suspect that Russia may well have given North Korea knowledge of materials such as the new carbon fiber, which Pyongyang claims to have used in creating the latest missile. 'They tested a hypersonic missile earlier last year, so they had already gotten some of that technology. But in almost all areas of technology, you kind of walk before you run,' Bennett said. 'The likelihood is that the Russian scientists have sat down with North Korean scientists, helping improve the vehicle from what they tested a year ago.'

Biden signs emergency declaration for California wildfires	U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a federal emergency declaration for California's wildfires that will release money and resources to battle the blazes. The president warned that area's recovery will take time. The Los Angeles County Fire Department faced four life-threatening wildfires that have killed at least two people, burned more than 1,000 buildings, and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate. 'The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities,' L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Wednesday. He said more than 2,000 hectares have burned and the fire is continuing to spread. 'We have no percentage of containment,' Marrone said. Officials have warned residents to pay attention to evacuation orders and leave when directed. Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters. In the Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry. 'We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades, Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Wednesday. 'We pushed the system to the extreme.' The call for water was 'four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight,' she added. Later Wednesday, support aircraft that had been grounded by the strong winds were airborne again, dropping water and fire retardant on the fire. More than 400,000 homes and businesses are without power across Los Angeles, according to poweroutage.us. Washington is supporting California's firefighting efforts with four U.S. Forest Service large air tankers and an additional tanker in on route. The federal government has also helped the firefighting efforts with 10 helicopters. Meanwhile, dozens of the Forest Service fire engines are ready to be deployed.

UN: Way forward for Syria's political transition remains unclear	UNITED NATIONS — The top U.N. envoy for Syria said Wednesday that the Syrian people and the international community need to get 'the next phase right' as the country rebuilds after nearly 14 years of civil war and the collapse of the Assad family regime. 'The way forward on political transition is unclear,' Geir Pedersen told the U.N. Security Council in a video briefing from Geneva. 'There are positive elements to build on, but also points of concern that Syrians are expressing.' A lightning offensive led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, seized control of Damascus one month ago, leading to President Bashar al-Assad fleeing to Russia and ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Pedersen said some Syrians have expressed concerns to his office about a lack of transparency on the 'timing, framework, goals, procedures in any national dialogue conference — as well as participation, in terms of criteria for attendance and balance of representation.' The caretaker authorities said a national dialogue conference expected to take place around Jan. 5 was postponed until they could form a preparatory committee to organize a conference with broad representation. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's de facto leader, affirmed in an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya on Sunday that there would be an inclusive national dialogue process. He also said that drafting a new constitution could take up to three years and that elections could take up to four years. Pockets of instability U.N. envoy Pedersen also warned that there are signs of instability in some parts of the country. 'While there are many areas where law and order appears to be good, we have seen multiple reports of incidents of violence — in the coastal region and Homs and Hama in particular — including accounts of degrading and humiliating treatment,' he told the council. He said videos have been circulating of apparent abuses or extrajudicial killings of officials from the Assad government but noted reports that the new authorities had arrested some of the perpetrators. He said there are 'significant areas' outside the control of the caretaker authorities where fighting continues and poses threats to Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. In northeast Syria, Turkey has warned that it may step up military operations against Kurdish fighters who control a large swath of territory. Pedersen also noted that Islamic State fighters remain 'a significant concern' and said they could try to take advantage of insecurity in some areas to reassert themselves. Israel also moved quickly to eliminate potential threats from the new de facto leaders in Syria, launching hundreds of airstrikes on the country in the days after the regime collapsed. Israel’s military also moved into the zone patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. 'Such violations, along with Israeli airstrikes in other parts of Syria — reported even just last week in Aleppo — could further jeopardize the prospects for an orderly political transition,' Pedersen warned. Syria’s U.N. ambassador sought to assure the international community of the new authorities’ intentions. 'Syrian authorities also stressed that the new Syria is willing to play a positive role in the international arena,' Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak said. 'It will be a positive contributor to the promotion of international and regional peace and security, and it will not engage in any conflict or war.' He said in the month that has passed since the fall of the Assad government, the country has entered a 'new era' and Syrians have 'removed the chains of oppression and reclaimed the freedom of which they were deprived for decades.' Aldahhak said all Syrians would come together to build a state of 'freedom, equality and rule of law, to achieve prosperity and civility, to turn the page of oppression and suffering and human rights abuses.' Humanitarian situation After nearly 14 years of civil war, Syria is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with 17 million people — more than 70% of the population — in need of assistance and funding in short supply. The U.N. humanitarian chief told the council that his office is releasing an additional $8 million for Syria from its emergency fund, bringing its total contribution to $20 million. Tom Fletcher urged countries to contribute to the humanitarian response plan, which calls for just over $4 billion and is only a third funded. The United States announced Tuesday it would expand authorizations for activities and transactions in Syria to help meet basic needs and provide public services or humanitarian assistance. 'This authorization is for six months, as the United States continues to monitor the evolving situation on the ground,' Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dorothy Shea told the council. 'The United States is committed to assisting Syrians in this extraordinary moment to forge a new future for and by its people.' Syria’s envoy welcomed the move and urged the U.N. and all member states to fully lift sanctions imposed on the Assad regime and provide humanitarian funding to help the country in its recovery.

Analysts weigh in ahead of ECOWAS members' exit deadline	Abuja, Nigeria — Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are due to officially exit the West African ECOWAS bloc of nations this month, one year after announcing their withdrawal. The bloc hopes to persuade them to remain, but some analysts say growing anti-French sentiment in the region and Nigeria's own recent dealings with France could frustrate negotiations. In each of the three exiting nations, military officers seized power in recent years in the midst of jihadist insurgencies. The countries formed an alliance last year and accused ECOWAS of pandering to foreign influence while failing to secure member states’ security. In December, ECOWAS announced a six-month grace period for the countries after a summit in the Nigerian capital to try to dissuade them from leaving the bloc. Aminu Hayatu, a political science researcher at Bayero University in Kano, said Nigeria's role at the center 'in terms of leadership of ECOWAS is really in a dilemma, because at one point, it has to be able to prove to France that it is ready to diplomatically relate with France. This is very implicating for Nigeria because it has to do it in such a way that it doesn't hurt the leadership position which it is occupying in ECOWAS.' Comments by Macron Resentment of the presence of French military forces has grown across West and Central Africa in recent years and soared again recently when French President Emmanuel Macron said some African leaders showed 'ingratitude' toward French efforts to help fight jihadist insurgencies. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who is the chair of ECOWAS, made a three-day visit to France in late November in search of investment opportunities for Nigeria. Some analysts said that visit could be misinterpreted and cause the juntas to be more resistant to the regional bloc. In a Christmas Day interview, Niger's military leader, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, accused France of supporting militant groups in the Lake Chad region to undermine Niger's security, allegedly with Nigeria's knowledge. Nigeria has dismissed the allegations as 'baseless' and 'false.' Hayatu is worried about the trend. 'It is really a great deal of concern, and that might exacerbate the already simmering tension in terms of the diplomatic relations between Nigeria and these countries,' he said. 'It could only escalate the bitterness if Nigeria really doesn't tread carefully in the way that it is romancing the French regime in this very volatile situation that many of these countries are in.' But political affairs analyst Chris Kwaja said that 'all member states of ECOWAS are sovereign entities. Nigeria has the right to go into diplomatic relations with any other country, as long as such relationships are not designed to undermine the sovereignty of any other country. No country should decide and define for Nigeria who the friends and enemies of Nigeria should be.' Rotimi Olawale, an Abuja-based political affairs analyst, said the Sahel states could not survive long without their neighbors. 'Right now, they have strong support in their countries, [so] they will ride on that support,' Olawale said, 'but I anticipate that as economic challenges pile up, insecurities very high, citizens will demand real solutions to local problems, and with that they need a lot of support from external stakeholders, including ECOWAS.' As of now, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are expected to officially leave ECOWAS on January 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-weigh-in-ahead-of-ecowas-members-exit-deadline/7930082.html	2025-01-08T12:43:50-08:00	
US envoy says Israel will withdraw fully from Lebanon, while some Israelis call for residual presence	AMMAN, Jordan — The Israeli military withdrawal from Lebanon’s southern town of Naqoura is the second pullout since the November ceasefire agreement, analysts say. Israel is to withdraw from southern Lebanon over a 60-day period, while Lebanon’s Shiite militia Hezbollah is to retreat some 30 kilometers north from the border with Israel and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. Filippo Dionigi, a specialist on Lebanon at Britain’s University of Bristol, told VOA there have been violations by both sides in this fragile truce. 'There was a 60-days deadline for Israel to move out of Lebanese territory and for the Lebanese army to take over control of those areas that were previously occupied by Israel. This has not happened yet for the greatest majority of the villages,' Dionigi said. 'There are 60 [villages] that are still occupied and only 3 of them have been actually evacuated by Israeli forces. On the other hand, Hezbollah has made several declarations that it reserves the right to act against Israel.' The ceasefire, brokered in part by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, sees the Lebanese army deploying alongside United Nations peacekeepers. Hochstein told Lebanese leaders this week in Beirut that all Israeli troops will leave. 'The Israeli military started its withdrawal from Naqoura, most of the western sector, and back into Israel proper. These withdrawals will continue until all Israeli forces are out of Lebanon completely. And as the Lebanese army continues to deploy in the south and all the way to the Blue Line,' Hochstein said. The 120-kilometer Blue Line is a U.N. demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights, but it is not an official international border. Analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA it is necessary for Israel to withdraw fully, which also will keep Hezbollah in check. 'You should not give any excuses to Hezbollah. As long as there is a problem, it will help Hezbollah rebuild its base,' she said. However, published reports in Israel say Israeli officials are pushing to keep some troops in southern Lebanon longer than stipulated by the ceasefire agreement. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute suggested to VOA that there may be a caveat on the ceasefire deal. 'It’s very clear that the Israelis only agreed to it because the Israeli understanding is that they would have freedom of action at any point if they perceived there to be the reemergence of Hezbollah south of the Litani River, or if they felt the Lebanese army was insufficiently present south of the Litani River,' Heras said. The Litani River is situated about 30 kilometers north of the border with Israel. Heras said that from Israel’s perspective 'it’s not withdrawing its ability to act in Lebanon. It’s essentially reconsolidating its forces out of Lebanon with the posture to be able to engage in Lebanon at any point in time.' Meanwhile, analysts say it’s unclear whether Lebanon’s parliament will succeed in electing a new president Thursday, which past sessions have failed to do for more than two years amid bitter divisions between Hezbollah and its opponents. Hochstein urged political consensus to break the deadlock. His push is part of calls by both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations to end the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza quickly. In Gaza, Hamas leaders said they cleared a list of 34 hostages to go free in the first stage under a truce, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed there would be 'hell to pay' if hostages are not freed before his inauguration on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-says-israel-will-withdraw-fully-from-lebanon-while-some-in-israel-call-for-residual-presence/7930073.html	2025-01-08T12:42:05-08:00

India boosts diplomatic contacts with Afghanistan's Taliban	ISLAMABAD — India pledged Wednesday to collaborate with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to undertake development projects in the impoverished nation that has endured years of devastating war and natural disasters. The pledge stemmed from a Wednesday meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as the two countries move to strengthen bilateral trade and political ties. Misri conveyed New Delhi’s 'readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people,' India’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said after he met with Muttaqi. The Taliban said in a post-meeting announcement that the two sides reviewed the security situation in the region. Mutaqqi appreciated and thanked New Delhi for its sustained humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. 'In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance program,' said the Indian statement. It added that in response to the Taliban’s request, New Delhi also agreed to provide additional material assistance to the health sector and the rehabilitation of refugees in Afghanistan. The Afghan delegation 'underlined its sensitivities to India’s security concerns.' Both countries agreed to remain in touch and continue regular contact at various levels, the Indian ministry stated. The Taliban stated that Muttaqi assured the Indian delegation that his government is pursuing a 'balanced and economy-oriented foreign policy.' He expressed his desire for political and economic relations with India, recognizing its significance as a prominent economic country in the region. '[Our] foreign minister assured the Indian side that there is no danger to anyone from Afghanistan and expressed hope for strengthening diplomatic relations and creating facilities related to visas for businessmen, patients, and students,' said the Taliban statement. It added that the Indian foreign secretary 'praised the Islamic Emirate’s fight against drugs and corruption in the country,' referring to the Taliban’s official name for Afghanistan. Misri said India was willing to expand relations with Afghanistan in political and economic areas and to promote trade through the port of Chabahar in neighboring Iran. The Taliban returned to power in August 2021 when all U.S.-led international troops withdrew from the country. No countries have formally recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, but several neighboring and regional countries, including China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran and Qatar, have retained their embassies. India recently reopened its diplomatic mission in Kabul, manned by lower-level diplomats. New Delhi’s stepped-up engagement with de facto Afghan leaders is expected to raise tensions with neighboring archrival Pakistan, as noted by analysts. Kabul’s ties with Islamabad have lately been strained over allegations that the Taliban harbor and support fugitive militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in carrying out 'terrorist' attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. Last month, the Pakistani military allegedly carried out airstrikes against suspected TTP hideouts in an Afghan border province, drawing strong condemnation from the Taliban. Kabul claimed the bombardment took the lives of nearly 50 'refugees' from Pakistan. Islamabad has publicly refrained from acknowledging the cross-border attack, but Pakistani officials anonymously confirmed it and reported the death of more than two dozen TTP commanders and operatives. India also objected to Pakistan’s military aggression against Afghanistan. 'We unequivocally condemn any attack on innocent civilians. It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures,' an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said while responding to Pakistan’s aerial attack on Dec. 24. Several days later, Taliban security forces said they launched retaliatory fire against multiple locations on the Pakistani side of the border that they claimed were servicing 'as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' Pakistani officials reported the death of one security personnel and injuries to several others due to the Taliban military action, marking a sharp escalation in bilateral tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-boosts-diplomatic-contacts-with-afghanistan-s-taliban/7930005.html	2025-01-08T12:30:57-08:00	
Former President Jimmy Carter lies in state at US Capitol	Washington — Thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to come to the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to former President Jimmy Carter, who lay in state Wednesday in the heart of American democracy ahead of his pomp-filled state funeral. Mourners, who included numerous elected officials and Vice President Kamala Harris, highlighted the achievements and the humanity of the100-year-old, who died last month. David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said that the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes. 'He had such an impact on so many people,' he said. 'His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me.' The former president’s flag-draped coffin arrived in the Capitol rotunda Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s national funeral. In that soaring space – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: 'Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man.' And Vice President Harris – who a day earlier, in this building, certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy. 'He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy,' she said Tuesday. 'He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks.' Carter, who served as the 39th president, died December 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral. At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them. Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was 'a real moral person.' 'He taught Sunday school – I did, too!' she said, smiling. 'But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president.' South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, 'President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country.' President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat on Thursday. 'We may never see his like again, you know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,' Biden said in late December after receiving news of Carter’s death. Analysts say the two men have a few things in common. 'There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,' Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. 'And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that.' Thursday’s funeral will bring together President Biden and former presidents, including Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump. When asked what Carter and the next and previous president have in common, Galston paused. 'I don't even know how to begin to answer that question,' he said finally. 'The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as outsiders.' And now, here lies this outsider, decades after his presidency ended, inside his nation’s most venerated space.

How China's national liquor greased the wheels of corruption among Communist elites	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Kweichow Moutai, the distiller of China’s most prestigious liquor, has seen three of its ex-chairmen face investigations for graft over the past five years, with a new probe into a former head of the maker of 'firewater' announced earlier this month. Over the past week, the topic has been trending on China’s social media and comes even as the company continues to see growth in sales, despite a weakening Chinese economy and lagging consumption. Industry observers say that while the latest scandal is unlikely to hurt liquor sales, it highlights how corruption continues to ferment at Moutai – the drink of China’s state banquets since the 1970s. Latest probe Late last week on Jan. 2, authorities in China’s southwestern Guizhou province announced a probe into company official Ding Xiongjun on its website. Ding stepped down in April from the state-owned liquor giant, and, according to the announcement, is under investigation for 'suspected serious disciplinary and legal violations.' It is likely that Ding may follow in the footsteps of his two predecessors, Yuan Renguo and Gao Weidong, industry observers say. Yuan and Gao were jailed for life on charges of bribery in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Yuan died of a brain hemorrhage in late 2023. While the charges against Ding remain unclear, the image of Moutai has long been tainted as businessmen in China mostly recognize it as a form of 'hard currency' used for socializing with those in power. One of the company’s most-cited quotes was from ex-U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger to late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping at a 1974 state dinner, 'if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.' Wang Shoufeng, the former head of a construction labor force service company in Anyang, a city in central China’s Henan province, said that China’s corrupt officials only drink the pricey liquor even if that means taking extra measures to stay under the radar of anti-graft investigators. 'When our [property developers] friends invited officials for a drink, they often poured Moutai into plastic bottles, faking it as water. The liquor in the one yuan-worth bottles was valued at tens of thousands of yuan. That’s how they drank,' Wang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. Wang fled China late last year to Germany. Moutai as bribes Wang said that some Chinese officials in Henan were so greedy that many of his peers in the property industry had to 'buy their personal safety or get things done' by offering bribes, including gifts of aged Moutai. One such example was Wang Xiaoguang, a former vice governor of Guizhou province, who was found pouring some of his 4,000 bottles of aged Moutai down the drain when he was worried about a probe against him in late 2018, according to Chinese media reports. Many of China’s Communist elites, including Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, are also known to enjoy Moutai. Xi has also made corruption a key focus of his rule in China, purging more than five million, mostly party officials, between 2014 and 2024. Earlier this week in an address, Xi said corruption remains the biggest threat to the Chinese Communist Party. That said, officials and their love of the tipple has enabled the price to climb and peak at around 3,000 yuan, or $420, per 500ml bottle in February of last year, taking the flagship product 'Flying Fairy Moutai' as an example, which has a 53% alcohol level. Although its price has now dropped to around 2,200 yuan, or $300, the liquor’s fat margin compared to its factory price of 1,163 yuan, or $158, has created wiggle room for corruption, said Willy Lin, secretary-general of the Chinese White Spirits Research Association in Taipei. 'The [Moutai] liquor sells so well with a handsome profit that everyone wants a share of the pie. That makes it hard for those in the chairman’s seats to stay untangled with many interest groups,' Lin told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. 'You [the chairmen] need their support to get to that position, but once you're in, you need to help them make money. That’s when corruption sets in ... it’s not an easy position to hold on to,' he added. According to state media reports, both Yuan and Gao were found to have illegally awarded distribution rights to cronies or used the liquor to gain political clout before their arrest. Sales still strong? In 2018, China launched an anti-graft campaign against the liquor giant and has since arrested a dozen top executives, but the corruption at the brand's top management remains hard to root out. For now, the liquor giant’s sales performance appears to remain unaffected. In its latest financial report, released on Jan. 2 – the same day the probe into Ding was announced – Kweichow Moutai said it is expected to deliver 173.8 billion yuan, or $23.7 billion, in revenues for last year, seeing 15% year-on-year growth. China’s weakened domestic consumption, however, is fueling concerns that the liquor giant’s future may not be bright. One Shaanxi province-based vendor who sells a variety of spirits including Moutai on China’s short video platform Douyin told VOA Mandarin on Sunday that 'now is not a good time' to buy or invest in bottles of Flying Fairy Moutai since its price may keep plunging to below 2,000 yuan. A stock analyst in Beijing, who spoke with VOA Mandarin on the condition of anonymity, also expressed concern that Chinese consumers’ slashed spending on luxury goods may spell more bad news for the company’s share price as well, which too has been falling. 'Although Moutai's sales performance remains relatively stable, the company’s falling stock price reflects concern over its future sales,' the analyst told VOA. The analyst did not want to use his full name citing the sensitivity of the topic. On Wednesday, Kweichow Moutai closed at 1442.5 yuan per share, a 45% drop from its record high of 2,627.88 yuan per share in early 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-china-national-liquor-greased-the-wheels-of-corruption-among-communist-elites/7929942.html	2025-01-08T11:38:36-08:00	
Russian missile attack kills at least 13 in southern Ukraine	A Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least 13 people Wednesday and injured dozens more, Ukrainian authorities reported. The attack came minutes after regional Governor Ivan Fedorov warned that 'high-speed missiles' and 'glide bombs' were heading toward the Zaporizhzhia region. Bodies of the victims and people injured in the attack were strewn across a road and adjacent paved areas next to damaged public transportation facilities. The debris hit a tram and a bus with passengers inside, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. High-rise apartment blocks, an industrial facility and other infrastructure were damaged in the attack. Emergency workers were trying to resuscitate a man while raging flames, smoke and burned cars could be seen in the background. Russian troops used two guided bombs to hit a residential area, Fedorov told reporters. He said at least four of the injured were rushed to a hospital in serious condition. Fedorov said Thursday would be an official day of mourning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X, 'There is nothing more cruel than launching aerial bombs on a city, knowing that ordinary civilians will suffer.' As he often has, Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's Western allies to step up pressure on Russia. Russia regularly carries out airstrikes on the Zaporizhzhia region, which its forces partially occupy. Moscow claims to have annexed the Ukrainian region along with four others, including Crimea, which it unilaterally seized in 2014. Ukraine hits fuel depot Earlier Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said it struck a fuel storage depot deep inside Russia near Engels in the Saratov region about 600 kilometers east of the Ukrainian border. The attack caused a huge fire at the facility, which supplies an important Russian air base. Ukraine’s General Staff said, 'The damage to the oil base creates serious logistical problems for the strategic aviation of the Russian occupiers and significantly reduces their ability to strike peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian objects. To be continued.' Russian officials acknowledged a major drone attack in the area and said authorities had set up an emergency command center to fight the fire. Ukraine's General Staff said the attack hit the depot that supplied a nearby airfield used by aircraft that launch missiles across the border into Ukraine, a statement on Facebook said. Ukraine has been developing its own arsenal of domestically produced long-range missiles and drones capable of reaching deep behind the front line as it faces restrictions on the range that its military can fire its Western-supplied missiles into Russia. Zelenskyy said last year that his country has developed a weapon that could hit a target 700 kilometers away. Some Ukrainian drone attacks have hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers away. Meanwhile on Wednesday, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said any future deal to end the war in Ukraine would need to build into it deterrence to prevent Russia from once again attacking Ukraine. Speaking in Paris, Blinken warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would try to use any ceasefire in Ukraine to refit Russian forces and eventually attack Ukraine again. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missile-attack-kills-at-least-13-in-southern-ukraine/7929935.html	2025-01-08T11:18:43-08:00	
Poland assumes EU council presidency amid challenges	With the slogan 'Security Europe!' Poland assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union Council in 2025 at a pivotal moment. The 27-member EU country grouping faces a fragile economy, the ongoing impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and hurdles to enlargement. Adding to the shifting geopolitical landscape, the return of Donald Trump to the White House this month, with his 'America First' agenda, raises concerns about potential new U.S. tariffs on European exports and increased pressure on EU countries to boost defense spending. While leaders in France and Germany are preoccupied with domestic political challenges, Poland, often seen as a disruptive force in EU politics, is now moving into the driver’s seat. At an inauguration gala at the National Theatre in Warsaw on Jan. 3, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged his EU partners to focus on strength and resilience. 'If Europe is powerless, it won’t survive,' Tusk said. 'We must protect freedom and sovereignty and make Europe strong again.' Security, defense in focus 'Security, security, security — defense security, energy security, and food security,' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski emphasized to VOA when asked about Poland’s main objectives. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and hybrid threats from Russia and Belarus put Poland at the front line of European and NATO defense. Poland, which invests 4.7% of its GDP into defense — far surpassing NATO’s 2% guideline — is pushing EU member states to ramp up defense spending and develop a collective security strategy. 'Two percent is not enough. It is the absolute minimum,' Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told VOA, echoing President-elect Trump on his demand for European nations to spend more on their defense. The Polish defense minister added that nations that fall short risk losing influence in strategic decisions. 'Europe must do more for security, not to replace the Americans in Europe, but to keep them in Europe,' he said. 'Poland's role will be crucial during this time,' Mykola Kniazhytsky, co-chair of the Ukrainian parliamentary group on relations with Poland, told VOA. He emphasized that Poland has been a strong ally of Ukraine, and with its leadership in the EU, he hopes it 'will help to build a stronger defense system within the union.' In addition to security, Poland aims to bolster the EU's economic resilience. That includes fostering competitiveness, enhancing trade independence, and addressing energy challenges exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The vice president of the Res Publica Foundation, Magda Jakubowska noted that Poland sees opportunities to turn defense investments into economic advantages, creating a more robust and innovative European defense industry. EU enlargement, supporting Ukraine and Moldova One of Poland’s key goals for the presidency is to advance the EU's enlargement process, particularly for Ukraine and Moldova. Foreign Minister Sikorski stressed to VOA that while Moldova may progress more quickly due to its smaller size, Ukraine’s path is more complicated because of its large, diverse economy, as well as the war with Russia. He pointed out that Ukraine’s integration into the EU would require significant alignment with European regulations. 'It’s not really a negotiation,' Sikorski explained, 'Ukraine must align its national laws with the EU’s existing regulations.' Despite the challenges, Sikorski is confident that the rewards of EU membership would be invaluable for Ukraine, both politically and economically. Ukraine and Poland also need to address some bilateral economic and historical disputes. With Poland set to hold presidential elections in the coming months, Kniazhytsky hopes that political debates around Ukraine will not be used as a tool by political players during their campaigns. 'I hope that the strategic interests of Poland will come to the forefront and that we will see continued support for Ukraine’s aspirations,' he said. Jakubowska highlights Poland’s active role as a strong advocate for Ukraine and Moldova’s EU integration. Jakubowska emphasized Poland’s strategic interest in fostering democratic, free-market neighbors to the east, an objective that will, in her view, significantly enhance regional stability. 'European security very much depends on the neighborhood, on the secure neighborhood,' she said. 'So, the Ukraine accession is one, but also we have the Western Balkans. We have Georgia. And this is important to set a European tone, European agenda, and European priorities in those countries.' Jakubowska says the presidency offers Poland a platform to influence the EU’s stance on those nations, working to ensure that Europe’s eastern borders remain secure and politically aligned with democratic values. A test of leadership Poland’s presidency also highlights the growing influence of Central and Eastern European countries within the EU. The country’s geographic location and historical experience with authoritarian threats give it a unique perspective on Europe's challenges. The Baltic states and Poland have forged strong alliances, particularly in response to Russian aggression. With Sweden and Finland joining NATO, this regional bloc has become a crucial player in shaping EU and NATO policies. 'This is an opportunity for Central Europe to demonstrate leadership,' Jakubowska said. 'Poland’s presidency can set the tone for how the EU navigates security, integration, and economic challenges in the coming years.' Jakubowska sees Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s leadership as a valuable asset. She believes that Tusk, who was president of the European Council for 5 years, understands the intricacies of Brussels, and his leadership will be crucial for Poland’s presidency to be effective. 'We are ready to lead and fight for Europe’s freedom and sovereignty,' Tusk said during the inauguration ceremony in Warsaw. An ambitious schedule — 40 formal and 20 informal council meetings and 300 events during the next six-month tenure — will test Poland’s ability to unify the EU and drive progress on its ambitious goals for a stronger and more secure Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-assumes-eu-council-presidency-amid-challenges/7929931.html	2025-01-08T11:04:47-08:00	
Taliban refute Trump’s claims on US financial aid to Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday denied President-elect Donald Trump’s assertions that they have received billions of dollars in U.S. financial aid since regaining control of the country. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, responded to Trump’s claims by asserting that the Kabul administration neither anticipates nor seeks any assistance from the United States. 'In reality, the United States has not provided a single penny to the Islamic Emirate,' Fitrat stated, referring to Afghanistan’s official name under Taliban rule. 'Instead, it has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan.' The Taliban’s sharp response followed Trump’s news conference in Florida on Tuesday, when he was asked to comment on the alleged monthly payments of millions of dollars by the Biden administration to the de facto Afghan rulers. 'It’s not even believable. Billions of dollars, not millions — billions. We pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban Afghanistan,' Trump stated. 'This can’t be allowed to happen.' Fitrat claimed that the U.S. funds in question were primarily utilized for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the relocation and resettlement of their Afghan allies. 'A portion of this money may have also been used under the pretext of ‘humanitarian aid’ by international organizations. … [The] U.S. directed all this money to Afghanistan, primarily for its own interests, and now exploits it as propaganda against the Islamic Emirate,' the Taliban spokesperson alleged. The controversy surrounding provision of financial aid to the Taliban intensified following a Jan. 2 letter by Congressman Tim Burchett to President-elect Trump, which expressed concern over foreign aid being directed to the de facto Afghan authorities. 'These cash shipments are auctioned off, and after that, they are nearly impossible to track. This is how the Taliban is being funded and plans to fund terrorism around the world,' warned Burchett. 'The United States of America should not fund its enemies abroad.' He cited U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as having confirmed that non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan had paid nearly $10 million in foreign aid to the Taliban in taxes. The Taliban swept back to power in August 2021, prompting Washington and the West at large to suspend development aid to the country and effectively isolate the Afghan banking sector, freezing billions of dollars of central bank assets in the United States. The flow of humanitarian assistance, however, has primarily remained intact under the United Nations' supervision. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) refutes allegations that some of the funds it receives for humanitarian operations are being diverted to the Taliban. UNAMA has maintained that it transports cash into the country for the use of U.N. agencies and 'approved and vetted' humanitarian partners to assist millions of Afghans needing support. The mission has emphasized that all cash is deposited in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank before being distributed directly to the United Nations and other entities. It has also clarified that none of the cash brought into the country is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan or provided to de facto Taliban authorities by the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-refute-trump-s-claims-on-us-financial-aid-to-afghanistan/7929790.html	2025-01-08T09:39:38-08:00	
European Union rebuffs Trump's designs on Greenland takeover	The European Union on Wednesday dismissed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a military attack to take control of Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland as 'wild hypothetical stuff,' while confirming that EU states would be compelled to defend the island if Trump invaded it. Trump, set to be inaugurated for a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House on Jan. 20, refused at a news conference Tuesday to rule out military action to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island and earlier had vowed to slap high tariffs on Denmark if it refused to cede control. The Brussels-based 27-nation bloc, long a U.S. ally, however, attempted to avoid being drawn into a verbal sparring match with Trump, saying it was 'looking forward' to working with the incoming administration. As for Trump’s refusal to rule out military action to take over Greenland, a European Commission spokesperson said, 'We are talking about fairly wild hypothetical stuff about an administration that hasn't come in yet.' Another spokesperson added that the sovereignty of states had to be respected 'as a matter of principle.' Asked if Greenland was covered by a mutual defense clause binding EU members to assist each other in case of attack, commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said that was the case. 'But we are indeed speaking of something extremely theoretical on which we will not want to elaborate,' she said. Greenland is a mineral-rich autonomous territory of EU member Denmark and an associated territory of the EU. Trump has long publicly hypothesized about taking over Greenland, saying Tuesday, 'We need Greenland for national security purposes,' arguing that Denmark should give it up to 'protect the free world.' Aside from minerals on the island, it is a strategic Arctic shipping portal, especially as ice floes melt at the top of the world as the planet warms. Trump earlier in the day wrote on social media that the potential American takeover of Greenland 'is a deal that must happen' and uploaded photos of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who was visiting Greenland. 'MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN,' Trump added. Panama and Canada At his news conference, Trump also refused to rule out military action to secure control of the Panama Canal and use economic force against neighboring Canada to gain the upper hand in trade deals or merge the two countries. 'Canada and the United States, that would really be something,' Trump said. 'You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security.' Trump posited the possibility that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, a proposition that outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately rejected. 'There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,' Trudeau said. Germany and France Aside from the EU’s rejection of Trump eyeing a Greenland takeover, EU members Germany and France individually also rebuffed the suggestion by the incoming U.S. leader. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed surprise at Trump’s comments, saying European partners agreed that the inviolability of borders was a fundamental principle of international law. 'This principle applies and is a foundation of our peaceful order,' Scholz told reporters. 'In my discussions with our European partners, a certain lack of understanding has emerged with regard to recent statements from the USA,' Scholz said in an unusually blunt statement called on short notice. 'The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,' said Scholz, adding that Russia had violated that principle with its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France Inter radio, 'There is no question of the EU letting other nations in the world, whoever they may be ... attack its sovereign borders. We are a strong continent. We need to strengthen ourselves more.' Barrot said he did not believe the U.S. would invade the vast Arctic island that has been part of Denmark for more than 600 years. But he added, 'We have entered an era that is seeing the return of the law of the strongest. Should we be intimidated? Should we be overcome with worry? Evidently, no,' he said. 'We need to wake up and reinforce ourselves militarily in competition in a world where the law of the strongest prevails.' Barrot said he believes the United States is 'inherently not imperialistic' and said he 'did not believe' that it is changing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-union-rebuffs-trump-s-designs-on-greenland-takeover/7929685.html	2025-01-08T08:58:24-08:00	
Justice Department says it plans to release only part of Trump report for now	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that it will release special counsel Jack Smith's findings on Donald Trump's efforts to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election but will keep under wraps for now the rest of the record focused on the president-elect's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The revelation was made in a filing to a federal appeals court that was considering a defense request to block the release of the two-volume report while charges remain pending against two Trump co-defendants in the Florida case accusing the Republican former president and current president-elect of illegally holding classified documents. Aileen Cannon, the Trump-appointed judge presiding over the classified documents case, granted the request Tuesday, issuing a temporary block on the report. The Justice Department said it would proceed with plans to release the first of two volumes centered on the election interference case but would make the classified documents section of the report available only to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for their private review as long as the case against Trump's co-defendants is ongoing. 'This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the Department while safeguarding defendants' interests,' the filing said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-says-it-plans-to-release-only-part-of-trump-report-for-now/7929634.html	2025-01-08T08:09:24-08:00	
Chadian leaders denounce Macron's remarks, order French troops out of Chad this month	YAOUNDE — Chad's government has reiterated its order for French troops to withdraw from the central African country before the end of this month, following remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron that African countries are ungrateful for France's role in helping to fight jihadist insurgencies. Macron said on Monday that France did the right thing by deploying its military to the Sahel region but that the region failed to say thank you. Macron said the states of the Sahel region would have fallen under the control of jihadist insurgencies and would not be sovereign today without French intervention. Macron's statements sparked a wave of anger and disbelief across Africa. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Tuesday that Macron’s declaration dishonored and disrespected Africa. Deby accused Macron of being in the wrong era — and said that France has until the end of January to withdraw its troops. A special commission created by Chad's government to supervise the withdrawal of French troops also met in N'Djamena. Chadian Prime Minister Allamaye Halina, who chaired the meeting, said Macron's statements are an insult to Africa, which deployed over 200,000 soldiers conscripted from French colonies to help France battle Nazi Germany during World War II. Halina said France never gave significant assistance to Chadian troops, adding that Paris often focused only on achieving what he called French strategic interests. Caman Bedaou Oumar, a political affairs consultant and researcher at Chad’s Consortium for International Migration Studies, said there is an unprecedented wave of growing anti-French sentiment all over Africa, especially in Mali, Senegal, Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Niger, Gabon and Chad. Oumar said those nations, in particular, were places where France attempts to dominate politics by imposing people loyal to Paris as presidents. He said African countries are sovereign nations with militaries strong enough to assure the integrity of their territories. He added that Africans see the presence of France in countries that are rich in natural resources such as gold, uranium and oil as exploitative. France says its troops are in Africa to fight Islamic State and other terrorist groups. In 2012, French troops helped drive out Islamist militants who had seized control of northern Mali. But Senegal’s prime minister, Ousmane Sonko, said Macron's assertion that France is helping Africa to maintain peace and protect its sovereignty is wrong. In addition to Chad, Senegal and Ivory Coast have demanded the departure of French troops from their territory. Chad says several hundred of about 1,000 French troops have left the central African state within the past month. France handed over its military base at Faya-Largeau in northern Chad as part of the withdrawal last month, according to Chadian officials. Several hundred youths assembled in Chad’s capital, N’djamena, Wednesday to express their dissatisfaction at Macron’s comments. Secondary school teacher Hassan Dibunge said it is high time African countries assume full independence by ordering French troops out of their territories and making sure France does not exploit them economically. The 32-year-old said Africans can reorganize their armies and protect their territories without the presence of what he called ‘’exploitative’’ French troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-leaders-denounce-macron-remarks-order-french-troops-out-of-chad-this-month/7929601.html	2025-01-08T08:06:06-08:00

Eswatini AGOA trade benefits renewed for 2025	Mbabane, Eswatini — The southern African nation of Eswatini has secured continued eligibility for benefits under the U.S African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) for the 39 companies currently trading under AGOA, including some of Eswatini’s biggest brands. U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Sam Michel confirmed Eswatini’s eligibility in late December. Eswatini’s exclusion from the trade agreement in 2015 followed the country’s failure to meet benchmarks for democratization and respect for human rights and highlighted how the country’s political situation negatively impacted the country’s economy. In a written statement issued on December 21, U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Sam Michel said the decision to continue Eswatini’s participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act was based on an annual AGOA eligibility review, which concluded that the list of eligible and ineligible countries will remain unchanged for 2025. Eswatini, an AGOA member for 23 years, exported some $23.5 million worth of goods in 2022. It is among more than 30 African nations, including Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique, eligible for the U.S.-led trade initiative, aimed at boosting trade and economic ties between the United States and Africa through duty-free access. Swazi businesswoman Sonia Paiva emphasized the importance of international trade agreements to grow businesses in Eswatini, citing the benefits of import duty removal and increased market access. She said that exclusion from such agreements could have detrimental economic implications for businesses and citizens. 'We cannot afford to be excluded from such agreements, as the country faces the highest unemployment rate to date which affects over 50 percent of our population, which are mainly youth. We hereby continue to motivate our government to effectively put policies into place that will protect export businesses. With policies in place, trade agreements should be easier monitored for its compliance and implementation,' she said. Eswatini was temporarily suspended from AGOA in 2015 due to failure to meet benchmarks in democratization and human rights. The suspension resulted in thousands of job losses. However, the country was reinstated in 2017, reinvigorating its economic prospects and reinstating its eligibility for duty-free access to the US market. Wandile Dludlu, the deputy president of the opposition People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), expressed disappointment at the renewal of AGOA benefits to Eswatini, stating that the country's government continues to disregard the rule of law, arrest political activists and obstruct an international investigation into the assassination of human rights activist Thulani Maseko. 'We have MPs who are languishing in jail and have been convicted on the basis of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, for which not only was copied from the American version, but has been greatly supported by the same American government. And in our context, it is being used as a bush knife against pro-democracy forces and human rights activists. And we think it's very much an inconsistency on the part of the government of the U.S. We have a very hostile political environment [here in Eswatini], wherein the same government that they are opening markets to have refused to allow the international community to conduct an independent investigation on the murder,' said Dludlu. Sibusiso Nhlabatsi, a political analyst, criticized the renewal of AGOA benefits for Eswatini, also known as Swaziland. He argues that the American government's decision disregards the Eswatini's unfulfilled commitments, highlighted in the enduring political instability in Eswatini and the absence of a promised national dialogue to address the issues. 'The Americans are not as strict as they should when they apply these AGOA benchmarks on the Kingdom of Swaziland. But the political situation in Swaziland, regardless of the fact that they renew these AGOA benefits, which is of course beneficial to certain business people, the political climax in Swaziland, will never be the same post-2021. And it is also disingenuous on the part of the Americans because there are commitments that the King made during the unrest, the commitment for dialogue, and this was even budgeted for. But the dialogue has not taken place yet,' said Nhlabatsi. Eswatini government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo has reaffirmed Eswatini's commitment to comply with all AGOA requirements and maintain strong diplomatic ties with the U.S. government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-agoa-trade-benefits-renewed-for-2025/7929476.html	2025-01-08T06:13:51-08:00	
Trump asks Supreme Court to block sentencing in his hush money case in New York	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to call off Friday's sentencing in his hush money case in New York. Trump's lawyers turned to the nation's highest court Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Juan M. Merchan, the judge who presided over Trump's trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump's attorneys asked for an immediate stay of Friday's sentencing 'to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government.' The Supreme Court asked for a response from New York prosecutors by Thursday. Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or probation. Trump's attorneys have pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling giving him broad immunity from criminal prosecution as they tried to have his New York conviction tossed out. While that opinion came in a different case, Trump's lawyers say it means some of the evidence used against him in his hush money trial should have been shielded by presidential immunity. Merchan has disagreed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-block-sentencing-in-his-hush-money-case-in-new-york-/7929469.html	2025-01-08T06:06:09-08:00	
Burkina Faso amnesty law is ‘risky decision’ say analysts	London — In late December, Burkina Faso passed a law granting amnesty to soldiers accused of plotting a failed 2015 military coup. Analysts say current leader Ibrahim Traore, who took power in a coup himself and has since dodged several reported coup and assassination attempts, could be setting a dangerous precedent. In late December, Burkina Faso passed a law granting amnesty to soldiers accused of a failed 2015 military coup, against then-president Michel Kafando. The country’s current military dictator, Ibrahim Traore, who is widely understood to be behind the amnesty, has himself faced several alleged coup attempts from within the military since he took power more than two years ago, according to state media. Beverly Ochieng with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Africa Program, says the move could set a precedent for anyone wishing to oust Traore. 'It’s true, Traore’s decision is risky and it might set a double standard, especially considering the fact that he himself came to power through a military coup,' said Ochieng. 'Even if it doesn’t reduce the risk of further coup attempts or undermining of legal processes, he’s still able to save face and then sustain a semblance of popularity and unity.' But why has Traore made a move that could encourage further coup attempts? Political scientist Geoffroy Julien Kouao suggests a strategic rationale behind the amnesty. He says the experience of the pardoned coup plotters could be an asset in the country’s fight against militant groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaida. He says, their military and diplomatic expertise could be useful to the current government in their fight against terrorism. Personalities like General Gilbert Diendéré and Djibril Bassolé have great military and diplomatic experience that Ibrahim Traore wants to exploit. General Diendéré was a prominent figure in the Burkinabe military, serving as the chief of staff of the armed forces. Bassolé, a former minister of foreign affairs, was also implicated in the coup attempt and was subsequently arrested and charged with treason. Ochieng suggests it could be a defensive move on the part of Traore. She says the previous coup attempts against Traore were likely due to tension with senior members of the military, which Traore is seeking to calm by releasing their allies. 'Burkina Faso is still politically fragile under Traore,' she said. 'On the one hand, the numerous allegations of attempted coups against his government might be a means of playing up threats and also exerting more power, but they’re also a reflection of sustained opposition towards his leadership.' Burkina Faso has been battling a growing insurgency since 2015, with violence spreading across the country. The conflict has led to thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project show terrorist violence has only gotten worse during Traore’s time in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-faso-amnesty-law-is-risky-decision-say-analysts-/7929444.html	2025-01-08T05:56:06-08:00

US says forces struck Houthi weapons stores in Yemen	Sanaa — The U.S. military said Wednesday its forces hit weapons storage facilities used by Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack American warships and commercial vessels. The operation involved 'multiple precision strikes,' US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement, adding 'there were no injuries or damage to US personnel or equipment,' The statement did not specify the location of the storage facilities. 'The strikes are part of CENTCOM's effort to degrade Iranian-backed (Houthi) attempts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region,' it said. The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV said there were five raids in the northwestern Amran province and two in Sanaa province, where the capital Sanaa is located. The Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014 from Yemen's internationally recognized government and control much of the war-torn country's most populated areas. For more than a year they have been firing missiles and drones at Israel and at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have destabilized a vital shipping lane, prompting strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain that began in January 2024. Most Houthi missiles and drones launched towards Israel have been intercepted, but a missile wounded 16 people in Tel Aviv in December, according to Israel's military and emergency services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-forces-struck-houthi-weapons-stores-in-yemen-/7929429.html	2025-01-08T05:27:35-08:00	
Italy says Iran released Italian journalist Sala	Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was freed from an Iranian prison Wednesday and was flying home, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s office said. Her release came three weeks after she was detained in Tehran while working on a journalist visa. Iran had accused Sala of 'violating the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran.' Meloni’s office praised the 'intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels' in securing Sala’s release. Iran has denied any link between Sala’s detention and the arrest of an Iranian businessman days earlier days by Italian authorities. The United States accused the Iranian of illegally supplying drone parts used in an attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the strike. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-says-iran-released-italian-journalist-sala-/7929349.html	2025-01-08T03:55:29-08:00	
India's Modi looks to new economic playbook as risks mount	NEW DELHI — After world-beating economic growth last year, India's policymakers are scrambling to head off a sharp slowdown as worsening global conditions and domestic confidence wipe out a recent stock market rally. On Tuesday, Asia's third-largest economy forecast annual growth of 6.4% in the fiscal year ending in March, the slowest in four years and below the government's initial projections, weighed by weaker investment and manufacturing. The downgrade follows disappointing economic indicators and a slowdown in corporate earnings in the second half of 2024, which have forced investors to rethink the country's earlier outperformance and cast doubts over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious economic targets. The fresh worries are heightening calls for authorities to lift sentiment by loosening monetary settings and slowing the pace of fiscal tightening, especially as Donald Trump's looming second presidency throws more uncertainty over the global trade outlook. 'You have to revive the animal spirit, and you also have to ensure that consumption picks up. It's not that easy,' Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, said, adding India could expand its fiscal balance sheet or cut interest rates. Such calls come amid a flurry of meetings by Indian policymakers with businesses growing increasingly worried about faltering demand. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a series of meetings in December with industry and economists, customary ahead of India’s annual budget, which is due Feb. 1. Some of the measures proposed in those talks to boost growth include putting more money into the hands of consumers and cutting taxes and tariffs, according to requests and demands by trade and industry associations. Growing concerns As confidence wanes, the political urge to stimulate growth appears to be broadening. India's monthly economic report published last month said the central bank's tight monetary policy was partly responsible for the hit to demand. Modi has made some high-profile changes recently that are expected to lift economic growth as a priority over price stability. In a surprise move in December, Modi appointed Sanjay Malhotra as the new central bank governor, replacing Shaktikanta Das, a trusted bureaucrat who was widely expected to get another one to two-year term as chief, having completed six years at the helm. The appointment of Malhotra, who recently said the central bank would strive to support a higher growth path, came immediately after data showed September quarter growth slowed more than expected to 5.4%. During the pandemic, Modi sought to keep the economy growing by raising infrastructure spending and limiting wasteful expenditure to keep government finances in good shape. That lifted headline GDP growth but has not supported wages or helped consumption sustain an annual expansion of more than 7% over the past three years. While India's economy may still outperform globally, the question is whether it can maintain 6.5%-7.5% growth or slow to 5%-6%, said Sanjay Kathuria, visiting senior fellow at Centre for Social and Economic Progress. Arora said the country currently is in a 'bit of a limbo' where individuals are not spending. She expects this to continue if employment does not improve and wage growth remains weak. Reuters reported last month the government plans to cut taxes for some individuals and is preparing to offer tariff cuts on some farm and other goods mainly imported from the U.S., to clinch a deal with Trump. Economists say the government will have to slow some of its fiscal tightening to support growth with the success of such measures dependent on the extent of the cuts. With regards to trade, analysts say India needs a credible plan to fight Trump's tariff wars. If China remains the main target of Trump's tariffs, that could present an opportunity for India to boost its trade profile. India needs to 'seriously implement tariff rationalization to help embed itself more deeply into global value chains,' Kathuria, also an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University, said. This could include tariff cuts aimed at pre-emptively heading off punitive levies from a Trump White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-looks-to-new-economic-playbook-as-risks-mount/7929294.html	2025-01-08T01:45:05-08:00	
Ukrainian drone attacks target Russia’s Saratov region	Ukrainian forces carried out what Russian officials said Wednesday was a mass drone attack on the Saratov region, causing damage to an industrial enterprise. Saratov Governor Roman Busargin said the attack targeted the neighboring cities of Saratov and Engels, an area that is home to an airbase for Russian bomber planes. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 11 Ukrainian drones in the Saratov region, but did not say anything about damage in the area. Ukrainian drone attacks are typically focused on the areas directly along the Ukraine-Russia border, with some targeting regions further into Russia. Saratov is located in southwestern Russia about 450 kilometers from Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it also destroyed 21 total Ukrainian drones over Kursk, Rostov, Belgorod, Bryansk, Krasnodar, Volgograd and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday that Russian attacks overnight included 64 drones mostly targeting areas in central Ukraine. Air defenses destroyed 41 of the drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Sumy said the attacks damaged a house and injured one person.

Iran tells France to review 'unconstructive' approach ahead of meeting	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's foreign ministry called upon Paris to review its 'unconstructive' approach, a few days before Tehran is set to hold a new round of talks about its nuclear program with major European countries. On Monday, Emmanuel Macron said Tehran's uranium enrichment drive is nearing a point of no return and warned that European partners in a moribund 2015 nuclear deal with Iran should consider reimposing sanctions if no progress is reached. 'Untrue claims by a government that has itself refused to fulfill its obligations under the nuclear deal and has played a major role in (Israel's) acquisition of nuclear weapons is deceitful and projective,' Iran Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei wrote on X on Wednesday. France, Germany and Britain were co-signatories to the 2015 deal in which Iran agreed to curb enrichment, seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear-weapons capability, in return for lifting international sanctions. Iran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes and has stepped up the program since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 deal during his first term of office and restored tough U.S. sanctions on Tehran. French, German and British diplomats are set to hold a follow-up meeting with Iranian counterparts on Jan. 13 after one in November held to discuss the possibility of serious negotiations in coming months to defuse tensions with Tehran, as Trump is due to return to the White House on Jan. 20. Baghaei did not mention French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot's comment regarding three French citizens held in Iran. Barrot said on Tuesday that future ties and any lifting of sanctions on Iran would depend on their release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-tells-france-to-review-unconstructive-approach-ahead-of-meeting/7929274.html	2025-01-08T00:11:26-08:00	
Second wind-whipped wildfire is burning out of control in the Los Angeles area	LOS ANGELES — A fast-moving wildfire broke out Tuesday in the inland foothills northeast of Los Angeles hours after another blaze tore through the city’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood along the coast, destroying many homes and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands. The Eaton fire in Altadena started near a nature preserve just before 6:30 p.m. local time. The flames spread so rapidly that staff at a senior care center had to push dozens of residents in wheelchairs and hospital beds down the street to a parking lot where they waited in their bedclothes for ambulances and other vehicles to take them to safety. To the west, the Pacific Palisades fire that started Tuesday morning burned out of control into the night. The Los Angeles Fire Department put out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help fight the flames that were being pushed by winds topping 97 kph in some places and creating chaotic scenes as residents fled. It was too windy for firefighting aircraft to fly, hampering the fight. The Pacific Palisades fire swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes and prompting evacuation orders. In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways were clogged and scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and a bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see 'firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,' and he said he found 'not a few — many structures already destroyed.' Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began here late morning local time, shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be 'life threatening' and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 40 kilometers northeast, in Altadena, the Eaton fire was burning. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven’t seen substantial rain in months. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom warned residents, noting high winds were expected to continue all night. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor’s office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 11.6 square kilometers of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 10 kilometers away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked, for an hour.' An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 32 kilometers west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he’s lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs 'like small explosions,' which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. 'It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home’s safe, the other one’s up in flames,' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can’t evacuate. … I’m walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered 'any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.' Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe, Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School classrooms. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there’s been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn’t seen more than 0.25 centimeters of rain since early May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-wind-whipped-wildfire-is-burning-out-of-control-in-the-los-angeles-area-/7929249.html	2025-01-07T23:06:48-08:00	
India names rocket scientist Narayanan as new space agency chief	India appointed rocket scientist V. Narayanan as the new head of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the government said on Tuesday, a key role as India works to become a space superpower. Narayanan takes over from S. Somanath, who became chairman in 2022 and has been credited with making the 54-year-old space agency more approachable and opening it up to engage with the next generation. Narayanan, who has worked on the key rocket launches such as ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and led the center that designs and develops liquid propulsion systems for the agency, will take over on Jan. 14 for a two-year term. Narayanan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The $400 billion global commercial space market is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2030. India wants to expand its share in the global space market and grab a $40 billion slice of the pie by 2040, the federal government has said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-names-rocket-scientist-narayanan-as-new-space-agency-chief/7929243.html	2025-01-07T22:43:21-08:00	
Rescuers search for survivors after China earthquake	Rescuers in China’s Tibet region searched Wednesday for survivors trapped in rubble, a day after a powerful earthquake killed at least 126 people and injured 188 others. Chinese officials said more than 400 people have been rescued so far. Some 30,000 people have also been relocated after the quake, which destroyed more than 3,600 homes. Complicating the rescue effort were several hundred aftershocks and frigid temperatures in the region. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a massive rescue effort to minimize casualties and to resettle those whose homes were damaged. More than 3,000 rescuers were deployed, state broadcaster CCTV said. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing was dispatched to the area to oversee the relief work and the government allocated $13.6 million for the effort. About 6,900 people live in three townships and 27 villages within 20 kilometers of the epicenter on the Chinese side, state media said. People in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage, according to the country's National Emergency Operation Center. The area around Mount Everest was empty in the depth of winter when even some residents leave to escape the cold. The quake woke up residents in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu — about 230 kilometers from the epicenter — and sent many of them running into the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers. China's Earthquake Networks Center recorded the magnitude as 6.8. Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage. The epicenter was in Tibet's Tingri county, where the India and Eurasia plates grind against each other and can cause earthquakes strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks in the Himalayan mountains. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, U.S. officials said. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-search-for-survivors-after-china-earthquake/7929232.html	2025-01-07T21:42:26-08:00	
China expands consumer trade-in scheme to revive economic growth	BEIJING — China expanded the scope of consumer trade-ins for home appliances and will give more subsidies for digital purchases this year, in efforts to revive sluggish domestic demand, an official policy document showed on Wednesday. Microwave ovens, water purifiers, dish-washing machines and rice cookers will be included in the trade-in scheme for home appliances this year, according to a document issued by the top state planner and the finance ministry. Cellphones, tablet computers, smart watches and bracelets under 6,000 yuan, or $815, could get 15% subsidies. The statement did not specify the total cost of the incentives, however, a finance ministry official, said at a press conference on Wednesday that the central government had so far allocated $11.05 billion for consumer goods trade-ins to support consumption for 2025. China last year apportioned about $20.5 billion from the $136 billion special treasury bonds issuance to subsidize replacements of old appliances, cars, bicycles and other goods. Officials said that campaign 'had achieved positive effects.' The campaign resulted in $125 billion in auto sales and $33 billion of home appliances sales in 2024, Li Gang, an official from the commerce ministry said at the same press conference. The new measures are part of a broader plan to spur growth in the world's second-largest economy in 2025, where a severe property crisis has eroded consumer wealth and hurt household spending. Top Chinese leaders have vowed to 'vigorously' boost consumption and expand domestic demand 'in all directions' this year. Reuters reported last week that millions of government workers across China were given wage increases, as part of efforts to boost consumption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-expands-consumer-trade-in-scheme-to-revive-economic-growth/7929221.html	2025-01-07T21:10:20-08:00	
Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes kill 17 in southern Gaza	Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 17 people late Tuesday in the southern Gaza Strip. The strikes hit the Khan Younis area, including sections where people displaced by more than a year of war were living in tents. The Israeli military said in a statement that it conducted several airstrikes in the Khan Younis area targeting terrorists who took part in the 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. The Israel Defense Forces blamed Hamas for operating in civilian areas. Human rights groups and the United Nations have said civilians in Gaza do not have a safe place to go amid the ongoing Israeli strikes and ground operations, and in a territory where so many areas have been devastated by the conflict. Earlier Tuesday, Israel’s military said it carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, killing at least three militants and arresting 18 others. The Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed two militants in the village of Tamun after they fired at troops. Israeli forces killed another militant during fighting in Taluza, while an Israeli soldier was wounded. The raids came a day after gunman attacked a bus and car near the West Bank town of Al-Funduq, killing three people and wounding seven others. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Iraqi archaeologists piece together ancient treasures ravaged by IS	NIMRUD, IRAQ — A decade after jihadists ransacked Iraq's famed Nimrud site, archaeologists have been painstakingly putting together its ancient treasures, shattered into tens of thousands of tiny fragments. Once the crown jewel of the ancient Assyrian empire, the UNESCO-listed archaeological site was ravaged by Islamic State (IS) fighters after they seized large areas of Iraq and neighboring Syria in 2014. The precious pre-Islamic artifacts destroyed by the jihadists are now in pieces, but the archaeologists working in Nimrud are undaunted by the colossal task they face. 'Every time we find a piece and bring it to its original place, it's like a new discovery,' Abdel Ghani Ghadi, a 47-year-old expert working on the site, told AFP. Artifacts smashed into pieces More than 500 artifacts were found shattered at the site, located about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Mosul, the city in northern Iraq where IS established the capital of their self-declared 'caliphate.' Meticulous excavation work by Iraqi archaeologists has already yielded more than 35,000 fragments. The archaeologists have been carefully reassembling bas-reliefs, sculptures and decorated slabs depicting mythical creatures, which had all graced the palace of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II nearly 3,000 years ago. Seen from above, the pieces of the puzzle gradually come together. Shards of what was a single artifact are placed side by side, protected by sheets of green tarpaulin. Bit by bit, the image of Ashurnasirpal II appears on one bas-relief alongside a winged, bearded figure with curly hair and a flower on its wrist, as the restoration brings back to life rich details carved in stone millennia ago. Another artifact shows handcuffed prisoners from territories that rebelled against the mighty Assyrian army. Partially reconstructed depictions of lamassu — an Assyrian deity with a human head, the body of a bull or a lion and the wings of a bird — lay on their side, not far from tablets bearing ancient cuneiform text. 'These sculptures are the treasures of Mesopotamia,' said Ghadi. 'Nimrud is the heritage of all of humanity, a history that goes back 3,000 years.' A 'complex operation' Founded 15,000 years ago as Kalhu, Nimrud reached its peak 4,000 years later and was the second capital of the Assyrian empire. Propaganda videos released by IS in 2015 showed jihadists destroying monuments with bulldozers, hacking away at them with pickaxes or exploding them. One of those monuments was the 2,800-year-old temple of Nabu, the Mesopotamian god of wisdom and writing. IS fighters wreaked havoc at other sites too, like the once-celebrated Mosul Museum and ancient Palmyra in neighboring Syria. The jihadist group was defeated in Iraq in 2017, and the restoration project in Nimrud began a year later, only to be interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restart in 2023. Mohamed Kassim of the Academic Research Institute in Iraq told AFP that 'until now, it has been a process of collection, classification and identification.' About 70% of the collection work has been completed at the Assyrian palace site, with about a year's worth of fieldwork left before restoration can begin in full force, said Kassim, noting it was a 'complex operation.' His organization has been working closely with Iraqi archaeologists, supporting their drive to 'save' Nimrud and preserve its cultural riches, through training sessions provided by the Smithsonian Institution with financial support from the United States. Kassim said that the delicate restoration process will require expertise not found in Iraq and 'international support' due to the extent of the 'barbaric' destruction in Nimrud. 'One of the most important ancient sites of the Mesopotamian civilization,' according to Kassim, Nimrud is a testament to a golden age of 'the art and architecture of the Assyrian civilization.' The site was first excavated by archaeologists in the 19th century and received international recognition for the immense lamassu figures that were taken to Europe to be exhibited in London's British Museum and the Louvre in Paris. Other artifacts from Nimrud have been on display in Mosul and Iraq's capital Baghdad. The site has also attracted figures like British author Agatha Christie, who visited there with her archaeologist husband. On a recent tour of Nimrud, Iraq's Culture Minister Ahmed Fakak al-Badrani hailed the 'difficult' work carried out by archaeologists there, collecting broken pieces and comparing them to drawings and photographs of the artifacts they attempt to reconstruct. The vast destruction has made it impossible, at least for now, to ascertain which antiquities were stolen by IS, the minister said. And the process will take time. Badrani said he expects that it will take 10 years of hard work before the marvels of King Ashurnasirpal II's palace can be seen again, complete.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-archaeologists-piece-together-ancient-treasures-ravaged-by-is-/7929189.html	2025-01-07T20:03:10-08:00	
Trump not ruling out military force to control Greenland, Panama Canal	President-elect Donald Trump did not rule out using military or economic coercion to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland during a wide-ranging news conference in Florida on Tuesday.

Former Cambodian MP shot dead in Bangkok	BANGKOK — A former member of Cambodia’s opposition party was shot dead in Bangkok on Tuesday evening. Lim Kimya, a former politician of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), died at the scene near Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Ratchaworawihan, a Buddhist temple near the tourist area of Khao San Road in Phra Nakhon district, The Bangkok Post reports. Police say a man parked his motorbike and then shot dead Lim Kimya at about 4 p.m. before fleeing. The authorities say surveillance cameras near the scene show the man riding a red Honda motorbike, and that they are searching for the suspect. The focus is on catching the assassin, but questions remain about the motive of the killing, according to police. Phil Robertson of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates (AHRLA) told VOA the killing on Tuesday is an escalation of transnational repression and appears to be a political assassination. 'This brazen shooting of a former CNRP MP on the streets of Bangkok has all the hallmarks of a political assassination and looks to be a significant escalation in the use of transnational repression in Bangkok,' he said. Lim Kimya, 73, also held French citizenship and had reportedly traveled to Bangkok in recent days with his wife and uncle. He was elected as a member of Cambodia’s opposition party in 2013. Cambodian activists and politicians who have opposed the country’s regime have long been targeted at home and abroad. Those who have fled to other countries, such as Thailand, have been attacked, arrested and deported to Cambodia. Critics have coined the term 'transnational repression' to describe the phenomenon. VOA reached out to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment but has not yet received a reply. Cambodia has been ruled by Cambodia’s People’s Party for 45 years. Critics say the regime has targeted dissidents, opposition parties and independent media who pose any threat to its rule. Hun Manet took power in 2022, succeeding his father, Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly four decades. For a short time, the CNRP posed a legitimate challenge to Hun Sen’s rule after it was founded in 2012. But the opposition party was dissolved five years later after a Cambodian court ruled the party had attempted to overthrow the then-president. Members of the party were banned from political activities, and its founders fled the country. Kem Sokha, one of the party’s founders, was sentenced in 2023 to 27 years for treason. Robertson said Lim Kimya’s killing will have ramifications for other Cambodians who have fled the country. 'The direct impact will be to severely intimidate the hundreds of Cambodian political opposition figures, NGO activists, and human rights defenders who have already fled to Thailand to escape PM Hun Manet's campaign of political repression in Cambodia,' he added. In August, Hay Vannith, the brother of Hay Vanna, a CNRP member, was arrested at the Cambodian border. And in November, Thailand authorities deported Pen Chan Sangkream, Hong An, Mean Chanthon, Yin Chanthou, Soeung Khunthea and Vorn Chanratana back to their homeland for criticizing an economic trade pact Cambodia was part of. Observers and rights groups say Thailand and Cambodia have unofficial agreements in place to return political dissidents should they flee to one another’s country. 'This collaborative approach is not coincidental but strategically designed. Both countries share similar authoritarian impulses, with royal institutions and political elites working in concert to maintain their grip on power. By harmonizing their approach to dissent, Thailand and Cambodia create a more comprehensive mechanism of controlling political discourse,' Prem Singh Gill, a visiting fellow at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, told VOA in December. Since 2014, more than 150 individuals in Thailand have been victims of transnational repression, according to a 2022 report from Freedom House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-cambodian-mp-shot-dead-in-bangkok/7929182.html	2025-01-07T18:49:57-08:00	
Venezuela's Maduro says 2 US citizens arrested, branded as 'mercenaries'	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Two U.S. citizens have been arrested in Venezuela, part of a group of seven whom President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday branded as 'mercenaries' in the latest roundup ahead of the embattled leader's expected inauguration to a new term later this week. Maduro said the detained U.S. citizens were 'very high level' but did not provide further details or evidence of the arrests. 'Just today we've captured seven foreign mercenaries, including two important mercenaries from the United States,' said Maduro, who is set to take office for a third term on Friday following last July's contested election that the opposition says it won in a landslide. Maduro said the group of detainees includes two Colombians who he said were captured in unspecified parts of Venezuela, as well as three others who came from the war in Ukraine. Neither the U.S. Department of State nor Colombia's Foreign Ministry responded immediately to requests for comment. Venezuelan rights groups have warned of a revolving door of prisoners, with fresh detentions coming in even as older prisoners are released, including arrests of foreign nationals. In late 2023, Venezuela's government released dozens of prisoners including 10 Americans after months of negotiations between Caracas and Washington, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro, Colombian businessman Alex Saab. In remarks delivered from the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro on Tuesday claimed that his government's security forces have captured what he called 125 foreign mercenaries from 25 different countries who he said had entered the South American nation 'to practice terrorism against the Venezuelan people.' The remarks come as opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez is touring the region in a bid to grow his international support. Gonzalez has been declared president-elect by several governments, including the United States. On Monday, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said Gonzalez was the 'true winner' of the July 28 vote. While the government-aligned electoral authority and Venezuela's top court have decreed that Maduro won the election, the government has not released ballot-box level results to back up the claim. The opposition, however, has published thousands of scanned copies of voting machine receipts its observers gathered days after the vote, accounting for over 80% of votes cast and showing a lopsided Gonzalez victory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-maduro-says-2-us-citizens-arrested-branded-as-mercenaries-/7929175.html	2025-01-07T18:35:40-08:00	
UN report: Haitians face 'unremitting violence,' such as kidnapping, lynching	Haiti's residents are subjected to 'unremitting violence,' according to Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In a report released Tuesday, Türk's office said gang violence killed more than 5,600 people in Haiti in 2024, a figure more than 1,000 deaths higher than 2023's toll. In addition to the deaths, UNHCR said more than 2,200 people were injured by gang violence and nearly 1,500 were kidnapped by gangs. 'Restoring the rule of law must be a priority,' Türk said. 'These figures alone cannot capture the absolute horrors being perpetrated in Haiti.' Among those horrors was an incident last month in which at least 207 people, many of them senior citizens, were killed by the Wharf Jeremie gang in Port-au-Prince after a gang leader accused the group of being responsible for his son's death from the group's alleged Vodou rituals. The gang is reported to have burned and mutilated many of the elderly Haitians' bodies to destroy any evidence leading back to the gang. Other bodies were thrown into the sea. This incident was 'one of the biggest massacres reported in Port-au-Prince in recent history,' according to The Associated Press. Other horrors in the report included more than 300 lynchings. Most of those lynched were gang members and people affiliated with them, with some of the lynchings 'reportedly facilitated by Haitian police officers,' according to the U.N. human rights report. The report also disclosed that last year, there were '281 cases of alleged summary executions involving specialized police units.' 'It has long been clear that impunity for human rights violations and abuses, as well as corruption, remain prevalent in Haiti,' Türk said. He also called for more logistical and financial support for the Kenya-led mission in Haiti so that it can 'successfully implement its mandate' to deal with the unrest and violence in Haiti. Türk also called for a halt to deportations to Haiti because the country is not safe. 'The acute insecurity and resulting human rights crisis in the country simply do not allow for the safe, dignified and sustainable return of Haitians. And yet, deportations are continuing,' he said. AP reports that Haiti's neighbor, the Dominican Republic, deported more than a quarter million people to Haiti last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-haitians-face-unremitting-violence-such-as-kidnapping-lynching/7928169.html	2025-01-07T18:18:18-08:00	
Biden administration asks court to block plea deal for alleged 9/11 mastermind	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court to block a plea agreement for accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants that would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The Justice Department argued in a brief filed with a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia that the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to 'seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.' The military judge at Guantanamo Bay and a military appeals panel rejected Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's effort to throw out the plea agreement, saying he had no power to do so after the senior Pentagon official for Guantanamo approved it in July. Mohammed was due to enter his guilty plea on Friday and his two co-defendants next week. The Justice Department brief said the defendants, by contrast, would not be harmed by a short delay, given that the prosecution has been ongoing since 2012 and the plea agreements would likely result in them serving long prison sentences, potentially for the rest of their lives. 'A short delay to allow this Court to weigh the merits of the government's request in this momentous case will not materially harm the respondents,' the government argued.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-asks-court-to-block-plea-deal-for-alleged-9-11-mastermind-/7927869.html	2025-01-07T17:36:17-08:00	
DR Congo conflict displaces more than 100,000 people in a week	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of the Congo — Recent fighting in part of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has displaced more than 100,000 people over the last week, the United Nations humanitarian affairs office said Tuesday. M23 rebels on Saturday seized control of Masisi, a key town in the mineral-rich DRC. 'Between 1 and 3 January 2025, intense clashes between the Congolese army and a non-state armed group in Masisi Centre, North Kivu province, displaced an estimated 102,000 people, according to local reports,' the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Rwanda's foreign ministry said that the areas taken by M23 forces in recent days had been in the hands of Hutu militias linked to the 1994 mass killings of Tutsis in Rwanda. 'Many parts of Masisi territory are/were in the hands of the genocidal FDLR, which is a foreign force that is occupying a Congolese territory,' Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said in the statement. He also denounced international criticism that had not condemned 'the continued violation of the integrity of Congolese land belonging to Congolese communities, including Tutsi Congolese.' Masisi, with a population of around 40,000 people, is about 80 kilometers north of North Kivu's provincial capital, Goma. Relative calm returned to Masisi by January 5, prompting some displaced families to begin returning, OCHA said. 'Humanitarian actors warn the influx of displaced people may worsen Masisi's dire situation, with over 600,000 displaced as of 30 November 2024,' the UN body added. Between Friday and Monday, Doctors Without Border, or MSF, and health ministry teams treated 75 people at two hospitals in the area, MSF said in a statement Tuesday. 'In addition to providing this care, these two health facilities also sheltered hundreds of civilians for several days, who sought refuge there to benefit from increased protection,' said Stephane Goetghebuer, head of mission in charge of the medical charity's projects in North Kivu. The March 23 Movement (M23), a militia that the DRC and U.N. say is being supported by neighboring Rwanda and its army, has seized vast swaths of the east of the DRC since 2021, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. Rwanda's statement blamed the ongoing fighting on 'the marginalization of the Congolese Tutsi, victims of hate speech, discrimination and persecution.' Angola-mediated talks between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame were abruptly canceled in mid-December over disagreements on the terms of a proposed peace deal. For 30 years, eastern DRC has been ravaged by fighting between local and foreign armed groups, dating back to the regional wars of the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-conflict-displaces-more-than-100-000-people-in-a-week-/7928143.html	2025-01-07T17:34:20-08:00	
As winds fan flames, Los Angeles residents flee wildfire	LOS ANGELES — Firefighters scrambled to corral a fast-moving wildfire in the Los Angeles hillsides dotted with celebrity homes as a fierce windstorm hit Southern California on Tuesday, fanning the blaze seen for miles as scores of residents abandoned their cars and fled on foot to safety with roads blocked. One resident described seeing people crying and screaming as they ran away carrying their children and pets. Forecasters warned the worst may be yet to come with the windstorm predicted to last for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour) in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. Roughly half a million utility customers were at risk of having their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking blazes. In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, a fire swiftly consumed just over 5 square kilometers (nearly 2 square miles) of land, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 10 kilometers 6 miles) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' An Associated Press journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The neighborhood that borders Malibu about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of downtown Los Angeles includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he was down in town when the fires started and immediately went to pick up his two children from St. Matthews Parish's school, which is now in the line of the fire. His wife, who was at home, was driving down the main evacuation road for residents in the upper part of the neighborhood when embers flew into her car. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean. Adams said he had never seen a fire this low into the neighborhood in the 56 years he's lived there. 'It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home's safe, the other one's up in flames,' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can't evacuate … I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused President Joe Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, California, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. Biden will deliver his remarks in Los Angeles instead. The National Weather Service said the wind event that was expected to peak early Wednesday could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in more than a decade across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The winds will act as an 'atmospheric blow-dryer' for vegetation, bringing a long period of fire risk, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn't seen more than 0.25 centimeters (0.1 inches) of rain since early May. Much of the region has fallen into moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-winds-fan-flames-los-angeles-residents-flee-wildfire-/7928154.html	2025-01-07T17:25:24-08:00	
North Korea says it tested hypersonic intermediate-range missile aimed at remote Pacific targets	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations. The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea's military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing. North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine. North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles, which if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, North Korea has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability. Since 2021, North Korea has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it's unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims. The North's state media said Kim supervised Monday's launch, and that the weapon traveled 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 99.8 kilometers (62 miles) and 42.5 kilometers (26.4 miles) and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound, before accurately striking a sea target. Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak. Lee said the test was likely a follow-up to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile. Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North's nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal 'no one can respond to,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. 'The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,' the agency quoted Kim as saying. Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering 'different security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,' but KCNA didn't mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo. The launch took place while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea's launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North's weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim's nuclear-armed military. At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the efforts of the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even when Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-it-tested-hypersonic-intermediate-range-missile-aimed-at-remote-pacific-targets-/7928137.html	2025-01-07T17:21:09-08:00	
Peter Yarrow of folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86	LOS ANGELES — Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died. He was 86. Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, 'Puff the Magic Dragon,' died Tuesday in New York, publicist Ken Sunshine said. Yarrow had bladder cancer for the past four years. 'Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,' his daughter Bethany said in a statement. During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles and two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys. They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right' and 'Blowin' in the Wind,' into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed 'Blowin' in the Wind' at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a 'Survival Sunday,' an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together. Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper-middle-class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year. Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad 'Tom Dooley.' But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey. Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Pete Seeger and others. After months of rehearsal, the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous 'Peter, Paul and Mary,' reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, 'In the Wind,' reached No. 4 and their third, 'Moving,' put them back at No. 1. From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's 'If I Had a Hammer' and 'Where Have all the Flowers Gone,' Dylan's 'Blowin' in the Wind' and 'When the Ship Comes In,' and Yarrow's own 'Day is Done.' They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on 'Puff the Magic Dragon,' which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton. It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: 'A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.' After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's 'Leaving on a Jet Plane,' the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers. That same year Yarrow had pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly. Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit 'Torn Between Two Lovers' for Mary MacGregor.

Meta to offer wider range of speech on platforms, CEO says	OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that there would be a wider range of speech on Facebook and other Meta platforms. 'We're going to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram,' he said. Here are some of the key changes: Gone will be third-party fact-checkers eyeing Facebook posts for violations in the United States. Instead, Facebook will rely on 'community notes,' a system used on X (formerly Twitter) that allows community members to flag posts and vote on the legitimacy of them. Restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity will be lifted. 'What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms,' Zuckerberg said. Civic and political content, which the company stopped presenting to users in recent years, will be recommended again on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. And the firm's trust and safety and content moderation teams will move from California, considered a liberal state, to Texas, considered a conservative-leaning state. The move 'will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,' he said. Preparing for Trump Zuckerberg's announcement comes as Meta and other technology companies prepare for major policy and regulatory changes with the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House this month. In his attacks on the dominant technology companies, known collectively as Big Tech, Trump has been particularly critical of Meta, which suspended his account in 2021 after the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol Building. His accounts were restored in 2023. At a press conference Tuesday, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg's announcement. 'Honestly, I think they've come a long way,' he said. He said the firm was 'probably' responding to his threats that he had planned to do something about Big Tech and censorship. Reactions mixed 'This is cool,' Elon Musk said of the Meta announcement. Musk bought Twitter in 2023 and renamed it X and is a close adviser to Trump. X Corp. CEO Linda Yaccarino said on X that 'fact-checking and moderation doesn't belong in the hands of a few select gatekeepers who can easily inject their bias into decisions. It's a democratic process that belongs in the hands of many.' Also on X, Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised Zuckerberg's announcement as a 'huge step in the right direction.' 'Social media, AI, and other technology companies must resist governments' censorship pressure and instead work to ensure the open expression of ideas on their platforms,' Jordan posted. 'We hope that other Big Tech companies, including Google, follow the lead of X and Meta in upholding freedom of speech online.' Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor of human-centered design and engineering, said on the social media site Bluesky that Meta's decision will hamper people's ability to find out the truth. 'One remaining concern for me is that even people who WANT to find accurate information are going to be challenged to do it, because we're going to lose the groups that do this fact-checking work — unless non-profits step in to fill what is going to be a huge funding gap,' she posted. Yoel Roth, a former head of Twitter's trust and safety department, said on Bluesky that he was 'genuinely baffled by the unempirical assertion that Community Notes 'works.' Does it? How do Meta know? The best available research is pretty mixed on this point.' 'Too many mistakes' In his statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg described a complex system of filters the company created to identify 'legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation.' But the systems, while well-intentioned, made mistakes, resulting in wrongly censored postings, he said. 'We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship,' he said. The company will be 'dialing back' content filters that scanned for policy violations with the goal to 'dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms,' Zuckerberg said. Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a separate statement that 'too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail,' and we are often too slow to respond when they do.' Biden 'repeatedly pressured' Without offering examples, Zuckerberg said in August that the U.S. government under the Biden administration pushed for censorship. In August, Zuckerberg said in a letter to Jordan that Biden officials 'repeatedly pressured' Facebook to take down some COVID-19 content, including humor and satire. 'By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further,' Zuckerberg said Tuesday. 'But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-to-offer-wider-range-of-speech-on-platforms-ceo-says/7927856.html	2025-01-07T16:21:51-08:00	
US lawmakers honor former President Jimmy Carter in Capitol Rotunda	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers honored Jimmy Carter on Tuesday, as the body of the nation's 39th president arrived to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol. 'Today, we gather to celebrate the life of a man whose works will echo for generations to come,' Vice President Kamala Harris said to the distinguished guests and members of Carter's family assembled in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Carter, a one-term Democratic president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, will lie in state in Washington for two days, allowing the American public to pay its final respects. Harris recognized Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, instituting ethics reforms and founding the departments of Education and Energy. Congressional leadership also recalled his presidency, which occurred during a tumultuous time in American history. 'President Carter's life, his selfless service, his fight against cancer and his lasting contributions to his fellow man are all truly remarkable,' Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. 'President Carter was willing to roll up his own sleeves to serve and get the job done.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier Tuesday that Carter was 'one of the most decent men ever to hold the office of president. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word: kind, honorable, intelligent, humble, deeply patriotic. These are the virtues he brought to the Oval Office, in an era where trust in government was arguably at a low in the 20th century.' Carter's presidency began while the nation was still recovering from the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, the latter of which resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the decline of American trust in public institutions. Carter's term (1977-1981) was marked by economic inflation and crises in Iran and Afghanistan. 'President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn't agree with all of his policies, but you could agree with his patriotism,' Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA. Carter was the longest-living U.S. president, dying at 100 years old. His post-White House career traveling the world engaged in diplomacy and charity work redefined how American presidents lived after their terms in office. 'Jimmy Carter had a presidency at a time of tumult — the Iranian hostage crisis, inflation. Frankly, not dissimilar to Joe Biden's presidency in some respects,' Republican Representative Mike Lawler told VOA. 'But I think Jimmy Carter has always been viewed by the American people as a decent man, someone who really cared deeply about this country and its people and certainly in his post-presidential life was very focused on what he could do to help the American people and his work with Habitat for Humanity.' According to the Architect of the Capitol, only 46 individuals have lain in state or in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda since the nation's founding. Carter's remains will return to his home state of Georgia on Thursday for a private family burial. Kateryna Lisunova and Mykhailo Komadovsky contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-honor-former-president-jimmy-carter-in-capitol-rotunda-/7928119.html	2025-01-07T16:16:49-08:00	
Man who exploded Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas used generative AI, police say	LAS VEGAS — The highly decorated soldier who exploded a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas used generative AI including ChatGPT to help plan the attack, Las Vegas police said Tuesday. A laptop, cellphone and watch are still under review nearly a week after 37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger fatally shot himself just before the truck blew up. An investigation of Livelsberger's searches through ChatGPT indicate he was looking for information on explosive targets, the speed at which certain rounds of ammunition would travel and whether fireworks were legal in Arizona. Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, called the use of generative AI a 'game-changer' and said the department was sharing information with other law enforcement agencies. 'This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,' he said. 'It's a concerning moment.' During a roughly half-hour-long news conference, Las Vegas police and federal law enforcement officials unveiled new details about the New Year's Day explosion. Among the details law enforcement disclosed: Livelsberger stopped during the drive to Las Vegas to pour racing-grade fuel into the Cybertruck, which then dripped the substance. The vehicle was loaded with 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of pyrotechnic material, and officials are still uncertain exactly what detonated the explosion but said it could have been the flash from the firearm that Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself. Livelsberger, an Army Green Beret who deployed twice to Afghanistan and lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, left notes saying the explosion was a stunt meant to be a 'wake up call' for the nation's troubles, officials said last week. He left cellphone notes saying he needed to 'cleanse' his mind 'of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.' The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the Trump International Hotel. Authorities said that Livelsberger acted alone. Livelsberger's letters touched on political grievances, societal problems and domestic and international issues, including the war in Ukraine. He wrote that the U.S. was 'terminally ill and headed toward collapse.' Investigators had been trying to determine if Livelsberger wanted to make a political point, given the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect's name. Livelsberger harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, law enforcement officials said. In one of the notes he left, he said the country needed to 'rally around' Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-exploded-tesla-cybertruck-in-las-vegas-used-generative-ai-police-say-/7927870.html	2025-01-07T15:50:36-08:00

Russian gas shipments through Ukraine end; creating trouble for Transnistria	With temperatures dipping below freezing this week in Moldova's Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, the end of an agreement to ship natural gas from Russia through Ukraine has led to rolling blackouts, idle factories and a lack of hot water. Ukraine decided not to renew a five-year gas transfer deal with Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom. The agreement, which was negotiated before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, allowed natural gas shipments across Ukrainian territories to countries in Europe. Before the war, Russian pipelines supplied 40% of Europe's natural gas. Now, that figure is about 8%, according to data from the European Commission. Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit 'in the interest of national security,' according to the Associated Press. The European Commission has repeatedly emphasized that ending the transfer of Russian natural gas across Ukraine was not a surprise and that countries had time to prepare for it. But in Transnistria, a sliver of territory wedged between the Dniester River and the Ukrainian border, the end of the agreement is a serious matter. The pro-Russia separatist enclave, which fought against Moldova in 1992, declared a state of emergency over the end of the shipments. Moldova's Foreign Ministry told VOA in a statement that parts of the country west of the Dniester River -- which includes most of Moldova's population and the nation's capital, Chișinau — was preparing to stop supplies from Russia and has been buying gas on European markets, albeit at a higher price. Moldovan authorities said they offered to help the breakaway region obtain gas from European markets. In response, Transnistria's 'foreign ministry' claimed Moldova was attempting 'to manipulate public opinion by providing false information.' In a statement issued on January 6, it said: 'Transnistria has not received any specific forms of assistance or adequate practical support from the Moldovan side. There is none today.' Moldova's pro-Western prime minister, Dorin Recean, said that by 'jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has supported for three decades in an attempt to destabilize Moldova, Russia is demonstrating the inevitable outcome for all its allies: betrayal and isolation.' 'We view this as a security crisis aimed at allowing pro-Russian forces to return to power in Moldova and use our territory as a weapon against Ukraine, with which we share a 1,200-kilometer border,' Recean said. 'The Moldovan government remains committed to supporting all citizens with simple solutions for those in the Transnistrian region. Alternative energy solutions such as biomass systems, generators, humanitarian aid and basic medical supplies are ready to be delivered if the separatist leadership accepts support,' he added. Oazu Nantoi, a member of the Moldovan parliament, said he also believes that Transnistria is refusing help from official Moldovan authorities on the Kremlin's orders. Nantoi told VOA that most of Moldova is supplied until March. 'There, we are no longer dependent on Gazprom's monopoly. We can buy gas at market prices,' he said. 'Sometimes these prices bite, but Gazprom cannot influence consumption.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-gas-shipments-through-ukraine-end-creating-trouble-for-transnistria-/7927794.html	2025-01-07T14:25:15-08:00	
Son-in-law of Venezuela's opposition leader kidnapped	Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who insists he won the July presidential election against incumbent president Nicolas Maduro, said his son-in-law was kidnapped Tuesday morning in the capital, Caracas. In a statement on X, Gonzalez said Rafael Tudares was abducted as he was taking his children to school. 'Rafael was on his way to my grandchildren's school to drop them off for the start of classes, he was intercepted by hooded men, dressed in black, they put him in a gold-colored van,' Gonzalez said in the statement on X. Gonzalez did not provide any information on the status of his grandchildren, whom the Associated Press reports are 6 and 7 years old. The abduction comes as tensions are mounting in Venezuela. Both Gonzalez and Maduro claim to have won the presidential election. Maduro has continued to claim victory in Venezuela's July election, even though electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts following the election. The opposition said its collection of tally sheets from more than 80% of Venezuela's electronic voting machines prove that Gonzalez was the clear winner. Gonzalez has visited several countries in the Americas recently as he seeks to rally support for his effort to oust Maduro. On Monday, he met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. The U.S., most European countries and several Latin American countries have rejected Maduro's claims to victory, which have been recognized by Venezuela's top court and electoral authority. Gonzalez, who has been living in exile in Spain since the election, has promised to return to Venezuela on Friday for the presidential inauguration. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Monday that Gonzalez would be 'arrested and tried if he sets foot in Venezuela.' Venezuela is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Gonzalez. The controversial presidential election sparked mass protests that left nearly 30 people dead and more than 2,000 arrested. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/son-in-law-of-venezuela-s-opposition-leader-kidnapped-/7927763.html	2025-01-07T13:27:12-08:00	
Clashes in northwest Pakistan kill 19 militants, 3 soldiers, military says	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s armed forces said Tuesday that 19 militants and three soldiers were killed during counter-terrorism operations in its northwestern province bordering Afghanistan. The fatalities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa occurred during what the military called intelligence-driven raids on suspected militant hideouts in three districts, including the provincial capital of Peshawar. The military statement identified the slain insurgents as 'khwarij,' a term the government uses for the outlawed armed group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, known by the acronym TTP, which has been waging deadly attacks in the country. Official claims about insurgent deaths cannot be independently verified, and the TTP did not issue any immediate comment on the military’s claim. These were the first major clashes of the year between security forces and anti-state militants in Pakistan, following a dramatic surge in militant activity during 2024. In 2024, insurgent attacks resulted in the deaths of more than 1,600 Pakistanis nationwide. The death toll included nearly 700 troops and police force members. TTP and separatist groups active in southwestern Balochistan province claimed responsibility for much of the bloodshed. The Islamabad-based Independent Center for Research and Security Studies documented the casualties, stating that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistani security forces in a decade. This week, the TTP issued a warning that it would persist in targeting security personnel and escalate its attacks to encompass commercial enterprises run by the Pakistani military. TTP, designated as a global terrorist group by the United Nations, urged employees of military-operated companies to find alternative sources of income within three months and warned civilians to refrain from engaging with these businesses. Neither the Pakistani government nor the military has responded to the TTP threat. The militant warning comes as a surge in terrorist activities in Pakistan has strained its relations with Afghanistan’s Taliban government. Last month, the Pakistani military reported that 27 Afghan nationals were among more than 900 militants killed during counterterrorism operations in 2024. Islamabad asserts that the TTP operates from Afghan sanctuaries and receives support from the Taliban government to perpetrate cross-border attacks. Kabul has vehemently denied the presence of foreign militants in Afghanistan or the use of its soil to threaten neighboring countries. In December, Pakistan allegedly conducted airstrikes against TTP-suspected hideouts in an Afghan border province, resulting in the deaths of dozens of individuals. Taliban authorities condemned the bombardment, saying it killed nearly 50 civilians and describing the victims as 'Pakistani refugees.' While the Pakistani government has publicly refrained from acknowledging the attack, officials have anonymously confirmed it and said the airstrikes killed more than 25 prominent TTP commanders and operatives. Neither the Pakistani nor the Afghan assertions regarding the strikes could be independently verified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-in-northwest-pakistan-kill-19-militants-3-soldiers-military-says/7927732.html	2025-01-07T13:10:01-08:00	
Trump: 'All hell will break out' if Hamas hostages not returned	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday held an omnibus press conference at his Florida estate, where he explained his stances on key foreign policy issues as he prepares to take office in two weeks. He forcefully called for the release of hostages seized in Israel more than a year ago by militant group Hamas, saying, emphatically — six times — that 'all hell will break loose' otherwise. The Palestinian group’s stunning terror attack on civilians in Israel sparked a brutal conflict that has since inflamed the region and killed tens of thousands of civilians. His Middle East envoy had, moments before, joined Trump at the podium to brief reporters on his recent high-level talks in the region, saying that his team was 'on the verge' of a deal and that he would travel back in coming days. 'I don’t want to hurt your negotiation,' Trump said to Steve Witkoff. 'But if they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone.' On Ukraine, he expressed interest in meeting with Russia’s leader and repeated his vow to get the conflict in Ukraine 'straightened out.' Trump has not explained how he would do this. When asked about a key demand in Ukraine’s peace plan — that it be allowed to join NATO — Trump said, 'My view is that it was always understood' that Ukraine would not be admitted to the security alliance. He repeated his tariff threats against Canada and Mexico and his line that Canada should be a U.S. state, and he floated a name change, saying: 'We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.' Thessalia Merivaki, an associate teaching professor at Georgetown University, said Trump often uses bluster as a strategy. 'So, Trump has a record of just floating controversial ideas and positions to attract attention and generate interest and media coverage,' she said. Foreign policy Trump has not said how the United States will acquire control of Greenland, the large North American island that is an autonomous territory of Denmark. On Tuesday, he repeated his stance that 'we need them for economic security.' When asked directly if he would commit to not use military or economic coercion to back his increasingly voluble desire for control of Greenland and, also, the Panama Canal, Trump replied: 'I can’t assure you on either of those two.' Trump has accused Panama of violating the treaty under which the U.S. ceded control of the famous canal more than four decades ago, under then-President Jimmy Carter. 'Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake,' Trump said. 'Giving that away was a horrible thing, and I believe that's why Jimmy Carter lost the election.' Trump added that he liked Carter 'as a man.' He is expected to attend Carter’s national funeral on Thursday in Washington. President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy. First day and beyond Trump also said he would be 'making major pardons' on his first day in office, when asked about his previous vow to issue clemency to some of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in connection to the riot on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He also repeated past commitments to loosen what he called the 'quagmire' of U.S. environmental regulations and smooth the path for billionaire investors. He described his reelection victory as a 'landslide' for winning the Electoral College and the popular vote, although official results show he did not win the majority of the ballots, as third-party candidates shaved off votes. He promised to have future election results counted earlier on election night. He repeated his vow to 'drill, baby drill' on his first day in office by reversing Biden’s recent orders seeking to protect against offshore drilling. He accused Biden of botching foreign policy, saying, 'Now I’m going into a world that’s burning.' Trump will assume office Jan. 20.

Arrest of activist spotlights alleged illegal lithium mining in central Namibia	Windhoek, Namibia — Namibian activist Jimmy Areseb appeared in court Monday after being arrested for allegedly violating public order laws during a protest at a local traditional authority’s offices. Areseb and others at the rally accused officials of accepting bribes from a Chinese mining company in return for access to lithium deposits. The confrontation highlights growing tensions in Namibia’s Erongo region, where activists say the Chinese company, Xinfeng, is acting illegally. Images of an elderly woman being carried off by members of Namibia’s paramilitary Special Field Force on Saturday set the Namibian social media space abuzz, with some comments likening it to the apartheid era when the country was controlled by South Africa. In another circulating video, members of the widely feared police unit are seen confronting elderly men and women who had gathered at offices of traditional chiefs and councilors, whom they accuse of allowing the Chinese company Xinfeng permission to mine for lithium without following the proper channels and procedures. The tensions at Uis, a mining settlement in the mineral-rich Erongo region, culminated in the arrest of activist Jimmy Areseb for interfering with the Special Field Force, who were enforcing a court order for demonstrators to vacate the offices where they had camped for a week demanding to see the chief. At the center of the storm is Xinfeng, a company that Namibia’s commissioner of mines has charged with illegal mining. Community members are asking why police arrested Areseb but not anyone from Xinfeng. Speaking to VOA, police spokesperson Kauna Shikwambi said the two cases cannot be compared. 'Those, were obstructing officers, right there at the scene, now. The other one requires investigation, and there must be evidence, that’s why investigations take so long, to have evidence, that indeed an arrest can be affected or not. You can never compare that and that! It doesn’t make sense,' said Shikwambi. Xinfeng is accused by the activists of paying bribes to the chiefs, in order to gain consent for the mining. However, a Xinfeng spokesperson, Kuvee Kangueehi, said those claims are false. He said the company makes a contribution of about $550 per month to the traditional authority as part of its corporate social responsibility and this is being misconstrued by the community as a bribe. 'EPL’s, and mining claims, and all the rights are granted by the Ministry. So for what reason will Xinfeng bribe an entity that does not grant the license? And it’s not in the business of Xinfeng to bribe anybody,' he said. Local chief Sagarias Seibeb, who is being accused of turning a blind eye to the interests of his community in favor of the Chinese company, told VOA the people camping at his office, including Jimmy Areseb, are his in-laws. He said family members feel they are not benefiting from his position as a chief, and are using the Xinfeng issue to settle family disputes. 'I cannot deny someone access to do prospecting, or whatever, in my area. I am just a custodian of the area. The land belongs to the state and there is a section that deals with that consent letter, and that can be done with or without my consent letter,' said Seibeb. On Tuesday, the chief is to meet with protesters in the presence of police officers and officials from the central government to try and find a solution to the tensions troubling the community. Meanwhile, police say they are investigating the charge against Xinfeng.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrest-of-activist-throws-spotlight-on-alleged-illegal-lithium-mining-in-central-namibia/7927638.html	2025-01-07T11:52:14-08:00	
Critical minerals, waning Western influence a focus of Chinese FM’s African tour, analysts say	JOHANNESBURG — Critical minerals and oil, a renewed focus on the Atlantic coast, and the West’s loss of influence in the Sahel are some of the reasons analysts believe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has chosen the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Chad and Namibia as the stops in his visit to Africa this week. For decades it has been tradition that Beijing’s top diplomat makes his first foreign foray of the year to the African continent, and each time experts try to analyse the reasons behind the specific itinerary. 'It’s always a mix of big states and small ones. The main point of all of this is to show that China is a non-discriminatory partner; that it doesn’t have 'important countries,' the way Western powers would tend to cherry pick, Cobus van Staden, an editor at the China Global South Project, told VOA in a WhatsApp voice message. During his first stop to Namibia on Monday, Wang said the 35-year-old tradition of starting the year with an Africa trip shows the world that 'China remains Africa’s most reliable friend' and its 'strongest supporter…on the global stage,' Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Namibia and minerals Namibia is Wang’s southern African pit-stop this year. The country 'is China’s major maritime partner on Africa’s Atlantic seaboard, where the largest concentration of China’s port developments are located,' Paul Nantulya, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., told VOA. Van Staden echoed this, noting that 'the last year or two there seems to have been an emphasis on the Indian Ocean, this year they seem to be rebalancing towards the Atlantic.' Namibia is also rich in uranium and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and manganese. Namibia’s president, Nangolo Mbumba, said at his meeting with Wang this week that Chinese investment 'continues to play a significant role in developing Namibia’s uranium sector as one of the biggest global uranium producers.' Mbumba and Wang also spoke about Chinese investments in infrastructure such as a planned desalination plant. Chinese companies are also starting to build Namibia’s largest solar power plant this year. Republic of Congo and oil After Namibia, Wang heads next to the Republic of Congo, another Atlantic seaboard country and the incoming African co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC. The country, which is next to mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, has untapped mineral deposits, but its economy is mainly based around oil, which accounts for some 80% of its exports, according to the World Bank. Van Staden said 'the diversification of Chinese oil imports' could be part of the reason for Wang’s visit to the country, as well as to the other two oil producers on the agenda: Chad and Nigeria. 'The Republic of Congo used to be a big oil exporter to China, but over the years China’s diversified its oil supplies,' he said. However, the Republic of Congo is trying to increase production and last year Cogo, the Congolese subsidiary of China Oil Natural Gas Overseas, announced a $150 million investment in two oil fields there. A Chinese company also holds a controversial permit to conduct oil exploration near a national park. In a September meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso in Beijing last year, the Chinese foreign ministry readout stated, 'China supports the Republic of the Congo in developing a diversified economy, and encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in the construction of major infrastructure and regional connectivity projects in the country.' Over the years, China and its companies have been investing in major infrastructure projects in the Republic of Congo, building roads and modernizing the airport. It has gifted the country a new parliament building and construction is set to begin on a $9 billion hydropower dam this month. Chad and security Another country Wang will visit this week is Chad, the Central African nation that saw relations with Bejing elevated to a 'strategic partnership' during last year’s FOCAC. 'Chad and its immediate neighbors play a key role in China’s effort to secure global supply chains of critical minerals in the high-tech and clean energy sectors, including the EV industry which China dominates so far,' said Nantulya. Situated in the volatile Sahel region, which has seen a spate of coups in recent years, oil-rich Chad has been under military rule since a 2021 putsch. Chad is also one of several regional countries that have asked troops belonging to former colonial power France to leave amid rising anti-French sentiment. In December, Chad ordered France to withdraw about 1,000 troops from the country, where it had long been helping to fight jihadist insurgents. The void left by the West could be China’s gain, analysts said. 'It is the fifth former African French colony to remove French forces from its territory,' said Nantulya of Chad. 'China has been showing great interest in ramping up its strategic security engagements with these countries as seen by the sharp increase in Chinese military engagement in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal in particular, as well as Ivory Coast.' Nigeria and trade Analysts say one of the more obvious stops on Wang’s 2025 tour is Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and one of its biggest economies. Cliff Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg, said trade would be a major item on the agenda. 'Looking at Nigeria, one of the issues that also came out strongly during the last FOCAC was market access for African products into China, and Nigeria was one of the leading countries pushing for this idea,' he told VOA. 'So that will feature more prominently during Wang Yi’s visit to Nigeria.' Security is also a factor, said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. 'If you also look at the things that bind Nigeria and Chad together, one of them is the counter insurgency operations that both countries have been involved in for a while now,' he told VOA. 'Maybe the Chinese foreign affairs minister is also going to talk about security partnerships.' Filling the void Ojewale added that the stops on Wang’s trip can also be seen through the lens of regional geopolitical competition. 'Where the Western alliance and establishment have vacated in Africa, we’re seeing in equal proportion China or Russia in particular occupying those places — supplanting the Western alliance,' he said. And while such trips happen every year, Van Staden said this year’s trip is especially significant given that on Jan. 20th the U.S. will see a change of government when president-elect Donald Trump starts his 2nd term in office. 'I think the main message that [the Chinese are] trying to send is that they’re a constant partner, that they’re not fickle,' he said. 'This message is of course reinforced right ahead of the Trump inauguration, you know, where a lot of people expect a low level of interest in Washington in relation to Africa.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/critical-minerals-waning-western-influence-a-focus-of-chinese-fm-s-african-tour-analysts-say/7927642.html	2025-01-07T11:45:17-08:00	
9 million children in Ethiopia out of school; hijab ban in Tigray adds tension	ADDIS ABABA/MEKELLE, ETHIOPIA — Over nine million children are currently out of school across Ethiopia due to conflict, violence and natural disasters, with more than 6,000 schools shut down, according to the United Nations. In a report published on Thursday, the United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, said the highest numbers of out-of-school children are found in the Amhara region with 4.4 million, followed by the Oromia region with 3.2 million, and the Tigray region with about 1.2 million children. UNICEF said Ethiopia’s education sector has been 'devastated' because of conflicts, natural disasters and internal displacement. 'Over 10,000 schools, representing 18% of schools across the country, have been damaged by conflict and climate shocks, further reducing the availability of safe and functional learning spaces,' the report said. Yohannes Wogasso, the head of educational programs and quality improvement at the Ethiopia Ministry of Education, said the U.N. figure does not reflect the ministry’s own data and may be a result of different definitions of 'out-of-school student.' He said, 'I think the discrepancy may arise from the fact that they are not collecting real-time data, as it often takes a long time to gather accurate data.' Fighting forces children from class Conflict has forced the closure of many schools in the Amhara and Oromia regions, where rebel groups are fighting government forces. On Sept. 18, two teachers were killed in the Sinan district of East Gojam in the Amhara region, which created fear and concern among the region’s school workers, education workers said. Without naming a particular group, the local administration at the time accused armed groups 'who swear in the name of the Amhara people' of being behind the killing. The Amhara rebel group known as Fano denies targeting the teachers and civilians but admits it’s against the reopening of some schools 'for the safety of students and community.' Headscarf dispute at Tigray region school Meanwhile, some public schools in the ancient Tigray city of Axum have banned Islamic headscarves, forcing 159 female students to miss school, Muslim organizations in Ethiopia said. The Tigray region’s Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council said Axum school’s move to block Muslim female students who wear the headscarf 'undermines the values of religious tolerance in the country, where different religions respect each other.' The council alleged that 'Muslim girl students are being threatened, arrested and pressured by the police to remove their hijab.' Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education allows Muslim female students to wear headscarves in schools. The Islamic affairs council said the actions of Axum schools are not acceptable. 'While my classmates are at school, I am at home,' said a 12th-grade student at Axum Secondary School, one of the schools that imposed the ban, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. She said she wishes that authorities would reconsider their decision. 'Because of the war in Tigray, I didn’t go to school for three years, and now, because of the hijab,' said another 10th-grader, who also requested anonymity for safety reasons. 'Going to school at this time is scary; the police are arresting and threatening female Muslim students who wear the hijab around the school.' Kindeya Elementary School is another school that refused attendance of students wearing headscarves, parents said. Nuruya Mohamed, 55, is the mother of four daughters. Three of them are students at Kindeya Elementary School, the fourth in Axum Secondary School. She said all her four daughters are now staying at home because they are 'scared of the authorities.' 'I have never seen female Muslim students with hijabs being blocked from school in my life,' Nuruya said. The schools have defended their stance. 'Schools are not religious or political areas,' said Axum Secondary School Vice Director Gebremeskel Gebregziabher. He added that students are not allowed to enter school with religious symbols or dress, a policy that has been in place for decades. Some support for the ban The school has the support of some of the parents. Mulu Tamene, the mother of a sixth-grade student at Kindeya Elementary School, believes that banning headscarves in schools is justified. 'Schools should not be religious spaces. Students can wear the hijab up to the school entrance, but they should remove it once inside,' she said. Natnael Fitsum, a former Axum student, said that during his time in school between 1999 to 2010, 'teachers would remove the hijab and other headscarves from students,' he said, adding that 'it’s common for schools in Axum to ban the hijab.' A source from the Education Bureau in Axum who requested anonymity as he is not allowed to speak with media, told VOA that out of the 15 schools in Axum, four have banned the wearing of the hijab. However, the students said they wore the hijab when attending schools in previous years, including last year. Contacted by VOA, the head of the public relations department at Ethiopia's Ministry of Education, Mesfin Bogale, said, 'This issue concerns the regional education bureau.' The mayor of Axum, the head of the city’s education office and the head of the Tigray Education Bureau did not answer calls from VOA. 'This must be resolved urgently,' the Ethiopia Islamic Affairs Supreme Council said.

Trump special prosecutor temporarily blocked from releasing report on probe	Washington — A U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, a court order showed on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who presided over the now-dismissed case accusing Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents, directed the Justice Department not to release the report until a federal appeals court rules on a request from Trump's two former co-defendants in the case. Lawyers for the co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who were charged with obstructing the documents investigation, moved late Monday to block release of the report. Nauta and De Oliveira argued the report would improperly interfere in their case, which remains ongoing. Smith led both the classified documents case against Trump and a second prosecution accusing Trump of attempting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Both cases have since been dropped. Trump, who dismissed the federal probe and the two other criminal investigations he faced as a politically motivated attempt to block him from returning to power, said he welcomed the news. 'It was a fake case against a political opponent,' Trump told reporters at his Florida resort on Tuesday. 'If they're not allowed to issue the report, that's the way it should be ... that's great news.' A spokesperson for Smith's office declined to comment on the order. Justice Department regulations require Smith, who plans to wrap up his probe before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, to submit a final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland has previously pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his tenure. Prosecutors said in a court filing earlier on Tuesday that Garland, who appointed Smith, had not yet decided how to handle the portion of the report that relates to the classified documents case. Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case against Trump and his two co-defendants in July 2024 after ruling that Smith was improperly appointed. Prosecutors are appealing the ruling as it pertains to Nauta and De Oliveira.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-special-prosecutor-temporarily-blocked-from-releasing-report-on-probe/7927507.html	2025-01-07T10:28:55-08:00	
Calls grow for better protection after brutal killing of journalist in India	New Delhi — At a candlelight vigil for Mukesh Chandrakar, supporters called for justice for the slain journalist. Chandrakar, who was part of the Mahar community in the Indian city of Bijapur, was known for his coverage of corruption. He worked for the TV news channel NDTV and ran a YouTube channel 'Bastar Junction,' which has 170,000 subscribers. At the vigil on Sunday, RD Jhadi, who speaks for the Mahar community, told the media, 'We want a safe environment for journalists so they can work freely and without fear.' In the wake of the killing, the Press Club of India — one of the country’s largest media associations — demanded that the government pass protective measures for media workers. The body of the 33-year-old Chandrakar was discovered in a septic tank on Jan. 3. His brother had filed a missing person report to police on Jan. 1, noting that the journalist had been receiving threats. Chandrakar’s body showed evidence of a brutal attack, with broken ribs and fractures to the skull, according to local media reports. Chandrakar had recently investigated a road construction scam in Bijapur, which resulted in an official investigation into contractors. The state of Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister was cited in local media as saying that police suspect the murder is directly linked to the coverage. He said that the journalist’s report on corruption was aired on Dec. 25, and it was possible that the coverage was the reason for the attack. He added that charges are expected to be filed within a week. Chhattisgarh’s chief minister, Shri Vishnu Deo Sai, condemned the murder and the state government has set up a special investigation team. So far, at least three arrests have been made. One of those is an individual identified as Suresh Chandrakar, a distant relative of the journalist who, according to local media, was allegedly upset by the state government's investigation into the construction project after the corruption was uncovered, The police tracked hours of security video and phone records before making the arrest of Suresh Chandrakar. The killing was widely condemned by media groups in India. As well as his investigations into corruption, Mukesh Chandrakar was known for his reporting on the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in India. Gautam Lahiri, president of the Press Club of India, told VOA the case is not the first instance of a journalist being killed in Chhattisgarh. Lahiri said that the press club is demanding 'strict and swift' action. He added that the government needs to do more to protect journalists and should act on a long-standing call for better legislation to ensure media members are safe. 'The Press Club of India has been raising its voice for the protection of journalists,' said Lahiri, adding that the press club demands that central and state governments 'ensure the safety of journalists in the country.' The Editors' Guild of India, in a letter, described the killing as a matter of grave concern. The guild demanded that the state government 'spare no efforts in investigating the case speedily and bringing the guilty to book.' Media watch dogs have been expressing concerns over the declining state of press freedom in India under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Journalists who cover corruption in remote areas are said to be the most vulnerable. At least 24 journalists have been killed in India in relation to their work in the past decade, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The media freedom organization is investigating a further nine cases to see if reporting was a motive. Among those cases is Subhash Kumar Mahato, a reporter based in Bihar who covered illegal mining. Mahato was shot in May 2022. India ranks 159 out of 180, where 1 is the best environment on the World Press Freedom Index. Indian authorities deny any threats to press freedom and say that the media enjoys complete freedom in the country.

President-elect Donald Trump tries again to get Friday's hush money sentencing called off	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump tried again Tuesday to delay this week's sentencing in his hush money case, asking a New York appeals court to intervene as he fights to avoid the finality of his conviction before he returns to the White House. Trump turned to the Appellate Division of the state's trial court a day after the trial judge, Judge Juan M. Merchan, rebuffed his bid to indefinitely postpone sentencing and ordered it to go ahead as scheduled on Friday. Trump is seeking an emergency order that would spare him from being sentenced while he appeals Merchan's decision last week to uphold the historic verdict. Oral arguments were expected before a single judge later Tuesday, with a decision likely soon thereafter. A quick decision is necessary 'to prevent ongoing violations' of Trump's constitutional rights 'and a threatened disruption' of the presidential transition process, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a filing with the Appellate Division. Trump, less than two weeks from his inauguration, is poised to be the first president to take office convicted of crimes. If his sentencing doesn't happen before his second term starts Jan. 20, presidential immunity could put it on hold until he leaves office. Merchan has signaled that he is not likely to punish Trump for his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and will accommodate the transition by allowing him to appear at sentencing by video, rather than in person at a Manhattan courthouse. Still, the Republican and his lawyers contend that his sentencing should not go forward because the conviction and indictment should be dismissed. They have previously suggested taking the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Merchan last Friday denied Trump's request to throw out his conviction and dismiss the case because of his impending return to the White House, ruling that Trump's current status as president-elect does not afford him the same immunity from criminal proceedings as a sitting president. Merchan wrote that the interests of justice would only be served by 'bringing finality to this matter' through sentencing. He said giving Trump what's known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — 'appears to be the most viable solution.' In his filing Tuesday, Blanche argued that Merchan's interpretation of presidential immunity was wrong and that it should extend to a president-elect during 'the complex, sensitive process of presidential transition.' 'It is unconstitutional to conduct a criminal sentencing of the president-elect during a presidential transition, and doing so threatens to disrupt that transition and undermine the incoming president's ability to effectively wield the executive power of the United States,' Blanche wrote. Trump's lawyers are also challenging the judge's prior decision rejecting Trump's argument that the case should be thrown out because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last July that gave presidents broad immunity from prosecution. Manhattan prosecutors have pushed for sentencing to proceed as scheduled, 'given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and the finality of criminal proceedings.' Trump was convicted last May on charges involving an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she'd had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. Trump's sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense's request. After Trump's Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-elect-donald-trump-tries-again-to-get-friday-s-hush-money-sentencing-called-off-/7927434.html	2025-01-07T09:39:36-08:00	
UN calls for halt to all executions in Iran as numbers surge	GENEVA — U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk expressed alarm Tuesday at the sharp increase in executions in Iran and called on the Islamic Republic to halt all further executions of people facing the death penalty for a range of crimes. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' Türk said in a statement. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' According to the high commissioner’s office, at least 901 people reportedly were executed in 2024, including some 40 in one week in December. It says the highest number of executions in recent decades was reached in 2015 when at least 972 individuals were executed in Iran. After a decline in the number of executions, it notes that the numbers have risen sharply since 2022. 'At least 853 people were executed in 2023,' Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the high commissioner, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva, adding that the 2024 number of 901 executions 'is alarmingly, shockingly high.' The human rights office reports that most of the executions last year were for drug-related offenses, but that 'dissidents and people connected to the 2022 protests also were executed.' That’s a reference to the nationwide protests that erupted following the Sept. 16, 2022, death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police for the alleged improper wearing of the hijab. The International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran, which presented a report to the U.N. human rights council in March 2024 found 'credible figures' of up to 551 deaths, including at least 49 women and 68 children had 'occurred in 26 out of the 31 provinces of Iran over multiple months.' Throssell said there was a rise in the number of women executed last year. 'We understand that at least 31 women were reportedly executed in 2024. Now, that marks the highest number in 15 years. 'The majority of cases involve charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage. A number of them were convicted of murdering their husbands,' she said, adding that 'The method of execution, we understand, is by hanging.' She said it was difficult to know how much recourse people accused of crimes had to the judicial system because 'of the opacity of the system' in Iran. 'I mean, people will have lawyers, but it is very hard to determine how free and fair a particular trial may be,' she said. 'So, this is why we believe it is so important to be speaking out on the executions and also to highlight that there are people who are awaiting execution, who are on death row.' 'We are concerned because of this lack of transparency around what happens in Iran with regard to the sentencing and the carrying out of the death penalty,' she said. Human Rights chief Türk doubled down on his concerns by urging Iranian authorities to place a moratorium on the use of the death penalty 'with a view to ultimately abolishing it.' 'We oppose the death penalty under all circumstances,' he said. 'It is incompatible with the fundamental right to life and raises the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people. 'And, to be clear, it can never be imposed for conduct that is protected under international human rights law,' he asserted. International standards prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any but the 'most serious crimes' — crimes of extreme gravity, involving intentional killing — and 'may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-calls-for-halt-to-all-executions-in-iran-as-numbers-surge/7927391.html	2025-01-07T09:05:14-08:00	
US determines Sudan's RSF committed genocide, sanctions leader	WASHINGTON — The United States determined on Tuesday that members of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan and it imposed sanctions on the group's leader over a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the RSF and aligned militias had continued to direct attacks against civilians, adding that they had systematically murdered men and boys on an ethnic basis and had deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of sexual violence. The militias have also targeted fleeing civilians and murdered innocent people escaping conflict, Blinken said. 'The United States is committed to holding accountable those responsible for these atrocities,' Blinken said. Washington announced sanctions on the leader of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti, barring him from traveling to the United States and freezing any U.S. assets he might hold. 'For nearly two years, Hemedti’s RSF has engaged in a brutal armed conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces for control of Sudan, killing tens of thousands, displacing 12 million Sudanese, and triggering widespread starvation,' the Treasury Department said in a separate statement. Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in conflict for more than 18 months, creating a humanitarian crisis in which U.N. agencies have struggled to deliver relief. The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-determines-sudan-s-rsf-committed-genocide-sanctions-leader/7927309.html	2025-01-07T08:37:36-08:00	
Trump Jr. arrives in Greenland after his father said US should own it	The eldest son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Greenland on Tuesday for a private visit that heightened speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory. The Danish state broadcaster reported that Donald Trump Jr.'s plane landed in Nuuk, capital of the vast and icy territory that has some 57,000 residents. Local media broadcast footage of him walking across a snowy tarmac. In a statement, Greenland's government said that Trump Jr.'s visit would take place 'as a private individual' and not as an official visit and that Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Greenland is an autonomous territory that's part of Denmark. Mininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary for the Greenland Foreign Affairs department, told The Associated Press that authorities were informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours. Neither Trump Jr.'s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials had requested a meeting, Kleist said. The visit nonetheless had political overtones. The president-elect recently voiced a desire — also expressed during his first presidency — to acquire the territory in the Arctic, an area of strategic importance for the United States, China, Russia and others. The world's largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is home to a large U.S. military base. It is 80% covered by an ice sheet. 'I am hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.' My son, Don Jr., and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights,' the president-elect posted on his social media site Monday night, referring to his 'Make America Great Again' slogan. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation,' Trump wrote. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede has called for independence from Denmark, saying in a New Year's speech that it would be a way for Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States, insisting that the island is not for sale. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future of Greenland would be decided by Greenland and called the United States Denmark's most important ally. Denmark's King Frederik X has been asserting the kingdom's rights to Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean. Last month, the king changed Denmark's coat of arms to include fields that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented by a silver bear with a red tongue. The royal announcement noted that since 1194, the royal coat of arms 'visually symbolized the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state and the monarch.' 'We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark,' the king said in his New Year's address, adding: 'all the way to Greenland.' During his first term, the U.S. president-elect mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea. Reviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: 'For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.' Trump's eldest son has become a prominent player in his father's political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-jr-arrives-in-greenland-after-his-father-said-u-s-should-own-it/7927226.html	2025-01-07T07:08:24-08:00	
Why Ivory Coast, Senegal asked French troops to leave	London — In a major shift in West Africa's security landscape, Ivory Coast and Senegal, regional economic powerhouses, have ordered France to remove its troops from their territories. The withdrawals will mark the effective end of a decadeslong military presence by France in Senegal and Ivory Coast. But why is this happening? Geoffroy Julien Kouao, an Ivorian political scientist, explained that it is part of a broader strategy by African nations wanting to forge new partnerships. 'I think that African politicians want to diversify their relations, especially with the countries of the global south, such as China, Turkey, Brazil, the Arab monarchies of the Gulf, but also with Russia,' he said. Ivory Coast and Senegal are following in the footsteps of Sahel countries that are fighting a war against jihadis linked to Islamic State and al-Qaida. After almost 10 years of French military involvement failed to stop escalating terrorist violence in the Sahel, the former colonial power began removing its troops from the region in 2022. 'Coastal countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast are part of the new dynamic initiated by the Sahel states, such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Chad,' Kouao said. 'These countries are looking for more sovereignty and above all [politicians] don’t want to go against public opinion, which favors the departure of French troops.' Public opinion in West Africa has become critical of French and Western military presence in the region. Many see it as a continuation of colonial ties. It has even become the source of debunked conspiracy theories that France is supporting terrorist groups. Rinaldo Depagne, West Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, doubts the French military departure will improve security in Senegal and Ivory Coast, which border the Sahel countries and have seen terrorist attacks spilling over from them. 'The expansion of jihadism in the north of the coastal countries has been slow, but fairly constant since 2020,' Depagne said. 'It is not certain that the departure of French troops, and more broadly of foreign troops, will make a big difference, except perhaps in terms of information.' Asked if Senegal and Ivory Coast could seek military partnerships with Russia, as some Sahel countries have, Depagne said that.the presence of French troops in the Sahel between 2013 and 2022 did not restore security, and that the Russian troops currently engaged in the Sahel haven’t done any better. He said that this is largely because the solution to Sahelian armed jihadism is not only military but also political. Analyst Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands, noted that as French troops depart West Africa, France continues to train troops fighting terrorism. 'Certainly, French troops are going to remain involved in training and cooperation in Cote d’Ivoire, in Benin, likely in a few other places, so it’s not an end to the post-colonial military presence, but it certainly is an important shift,' he said. Other Western nations are offering military assistance to coastal West African countries. The U.S. will hold its annual West African military exercise, Flintlock, in Ivory Coast this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-ivory-coast-senegal-asked-french-troops-to-leave/7927218.html	2025-01-07T06:55:15-08:00	
Protests over power outages block Pakistan’s trade route with China	ISLAMABAD — Thousands continued their blockade of a crucial Pakistani trade route with China for a fifth day on Tuesday, protesting chronic, prolonged power outages in the mountainous region. The organizers of the sit-in demonstration in Hunza, a picturesque city with a population of more than 70,000, have pledged to remain in place until their demands are met. Rally leaders emphasized the town’s persistent inadequate power supply, noting that residents endure up to 23-hour electricity outages amid a harsh winter season. Both men and women participated in the protest, braving average daytime temperatures of -4 degrees Celsius and nighttime temperatures of -10 degrees Celsius, as reported by rally participants to VOA via phone. Rahim Aman, a Hunza resident, reported a gradual and substantial increase in protesters, saying female activists were seen using vehicles and loudspeakers to encourage participation in the rally. He said representatives of local political parties, traders and hotel associations were also present. Local authorities negotiated with the protesters but failed to persuade them to disperse and restore traffic flow along the Karakoram Highway connecting Pakistan to China. Hunza is situated on the scenic roadway traversing the Gilgit-Baltistan region, bordering China’s western Xinjiang province. Traders reported that numerous containers carrying commercial goods were stuck on both sides of the highway due to the sit-in demonstration. The crippling protest erupted more than a month after Pakistan and China announced that they would keep open their sole land port, the Khunjerab Pass, for year-round operations to foster trade connectivity between the two nations. The world’s highest paved border crossing, approximately 190 kilometers from Hunza, stands at an elevation exceeding 4,600 meters and was previously closed for four months annually due to heavy snowfall. The impoverished Gilgit-Baltistan region heavily relies on hydropower, but generation almost ceases during the winter months due to the freezing of rivers and lakes. Consequently, residents and business establishments, including hotels, must operate expensive thermal generators to maintain power supply. Residents and area experts have noted that the growing use of such generators by major hotels and other commercial entities is damaging the atmosphere in Hunza and surrounding areas. The United Nations reports that the Pakistani regions are home to some of the largest stretches of glaciers outside the northern pole and already face the growing threat of global warming. The Khunjerab Pass is an integral component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC. The multibillion-dollar corridor seeks to establish a comprehensive trade and transit infrastructure between the two nations, the most populous and fifth-most populous in the world. Beijing has invested more than $25 billion in Pakistan since the two countries launched the CPEC a decade ago and is eager to use Gwadar, a Chinese-managed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea, as a strategic gateway to international markets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-over-power-outages-block-pakistan-s-trade-route-with-china/7927174.html	2025-01-07T06:53:07-08:00	
Chinese-owned gold mine stirs controversy in eastern Zimbabwe	Mutare, Zimbabwe — Government officials in Zimbabwe have been scrutinizing a Chinese mining company that has been operating a gold mine in the country’s east since at least 2021. The scrutiny comes as residents voice concern about the impact on health and the environment. The company in question is Sino Africa Huijin Holdings, which faces accusations of severe environmental destruction and community harm. Its gold prospecting operations have been taking place in an area known as Premier Estate in the Mutasa District of Manicaland. Villagers and community groups have complained about the blasting that has taken place at the mine. Nearby residents have reported widespread ecological damage, including the decimation of a mountain and the displacement of wildlife. They also say tremors from the blasts have caused structural damage to homes. Residents further complain of dust pollution and the potential contamination of water sources due to alleged leaching of cyanide. Cyanide leaching is a method of extracting gold from ore that can pollute water resources. Adding to these concerns, Sino Africa is accused of forging community signatures on their Environmental Impact Assessment document, raising questions about the transparency and legitimacy of their operations. The complaints prompted the government to shut down the mine’s operations twice in 2024. In the past two months, however, mining has resumed. 'We are between a rock and a hard place. If it's possible, let them compensate us and relocate us because it's no longer appealing,' Ishewedenga Moyo, one of 30 residents living within some 300 meters of the Sino Africa Huijin mine, told VOA in December. 'The vibrations and noise generated by mining blasting are disrupting wildlife habitats and ecosystems, damaging biodiversity, and causing cracks in our homes,' Moyo added. Government-ordered suspensions A Manicaland Joint Command Task Force, composed of a number of government entities, ordered the temporary closure of Sino Africa Huijin's gold mining operations twice. Officials say the shutdowns were enforced to ensure the mine met all necessary requirements. The first suspension occurred in October and lasted two weeks. Sino Africa Huijin made pledges to improve the situation and was allowed to resume operations. Then, the task force ordered the mine to close a second time in mid-November. Traditional Chief James Kurauone of the Mutasa district told VOA on Dec. 11 that officials forced Sino Africa Huijing's operations to stop each time because the company 'failed to address critical concerns raised by the local community.' 'These concerns that led to the temporary closure included severe air pollution, destructive blasting activities impacting local homes, and the company's failure to fulfill its corporate social responsibility obligations,' said Mutasa in recent comments. Mutasa added that he plans to convene a meeting with mining officials and members from the community to discuss a path forward in a couple of weeks. Mining compliance Mining operations resumed on November 25 at the conclusion of discussions among government officials, community leaders and company representatives. Daniel Panganai, the current HR manager of Sino Africa Huijin, was involved in the discussions. He told VOA in mid-December that the company 'complied with all the requirements outlined in writing, but I cannot divulge much information at this time.' Misheck Mugadza, the Manicaland minister of state, also said in December that Sino Africa Huijin committed to adhering to all mining and environmental regulations. He said the Chinese company had acted on its social responsibility obligations by donating to the local hospital and drilling a well to provide water to the local school. The government is closely monitoring the company's operations, Mugadza said, and some households have already received full compensation for damages. He further stated that the company is obligated to compensate all affected residents. Chinese investments in Zimbabwean mines The controversy surrounding the Sino Africa Huijin mine is not isolated, according to a September report by the Center for Natural Resource Governance, or CNRG, a Harare-based community rights organization. The report, which assessed the impact of Chinese investment on Zimbabwe's mining industry, found that 'Chinese mining ventures have led to widespread environmental degradation, disregard for the cultural rights of host communities, and, in many cases, the violation of the country’s labor laws, often with apparent impunity.' Chinese investors control an estimated 90% of the of Zimbabwe’s mining industry, according to the report. 'In 2023 alone, Sino investments in Zimbabwe’s mining sector saw 121 investors contributing a staggering $2.79 billion,' said CNRG Executive Director Farai Maguwu, who was quoted in a post on the organization’s website. Separately, another area resident voiced criticism of the government’s response to the mining. 'There are times when the mine uses explosives of higher magnitude, and there will be tremors,' said area resident Thobekile Mhenziwamukuru. 'When we call the government officials about the crisis, they always go directly alone to the Sino mine offices without any community leaders, then they will come and address us, just saying they will use explosives of low magnitude next time and we now know that it's now their cash cow. 'Even in terms of closing and reopening of the mine, instead of solving our grievances, there is no fairness in everything because money is being exchanged to slow the progress and we hope higher offices in government will come to rescue us,' she concluded. Maguwu accused local lawmakers of corruption, saying, 'Instead of enforcing the law, they are cashing in on this illegality by forcing them to close down, demanding bribes for reopening, and then returning to close them down again and demand another bribe.' Despite repeated phone calls and visits to the offices of government stakeholders to address these accusations, including the Ministry of Mines and the Environmental Management Agency, VOA received no response. 'This cycle goes on and on while the environment is being sacrificed,' Maguwu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-owned-gold-mine-stirs-controversy-in-eastern-zimbabwe/7927141.html	2025-01-07T06:01:33-08:00	
Meta shelves fact-checking program in US, adopts X-like 'Community Notes' model	Meta is ending its fact-checking program in the U.S. and replacing it with a 'Community Notes' system similar to that on Elon Musk-owned X, the Facebook parent said on Tuesday. The Community Notes model will allow users on Meta's social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads to call out posts that are potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the responsibility on independent fact checking organizations and experts. 'Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how ... A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor,' Meta said. Meta added that its efforts over the years to manage content across its platforms have expanded 'to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable.' The company said it would begin phasing in Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months and would improve the model over the course of the year. It will also stop demoting fact-checked content and use a label notifying users there is additional information related to the post, instead of the company's current method of displaying full-screen warnings that users have to click through before even viewing the post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-shelves-fact-checking-program-in-us-adopts-x-like-community-notes-model-/7927124.html	2025-01-07T05:53:07-08:00

South Korean anti-corruption agency receives new court warrant to detain impeached President Yoon	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea's anti-corruption agency said it received a new court warrant on Tuesday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its previous attempt was blocked by the presidential security service last week. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which plans to question the embattled president on rebellion allegations over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3, didn't immediately confirm how long the warrant would remain valid. The agency's chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, refused to answer when asked by lawmakers when the warrant would expire, saying such information is sensitive as the agency and police contemplate ways to execute it. Detention warrants typically last seven days but can be extended to around 10 days. Oh didn't say when investigators planned to make their next attempt to detain Yoon. The Seoul Western District Court last week had initially issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after he repeatedly defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning. About 150 anti-corruption agency investigators and police officers attempted to detain Yoon on Friday but retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours. The investigators did not make another attempt to detain Yoon and the previous court warrants expired after a week on Monday. If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours. The anti-corruption agency and police have pledged to make a more forceful effort to detain Yoon, which could be a complicated process as long as he remains in his official residence. The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with the police and military into Yoon's brief power grab, which included declaring martial law and dispatching troops to surround the National Assembly. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later. Yoon's presidential powers were suspended after the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. The Constitutional Court has started deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. Members of the presidential security staff were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to the presidential compound over the weekend. Oh confirmed to lawmakers that the agency was debating with police on whether to arrest members of the presidential security staff if they forcefully obstruct efforts to detain Yoon. Police have said they are considering 'all available options' to bring Yoon into custody and haven't publicly ruled out the possibility of deploying SWAT teams, although it's unclear whether investigators would risk escalating a confrontation with presidential security forces, who are also armed. Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, has hit back against criticism that it has become Yoon's private army, saying it has legal obligations to protect the incumbent president. He and his deputy have so far defied summonses by police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday's events. In a parliament hearing Tuesday, Oh criticized the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, for instructing police to oblige with the presidential security service's request to deploy personnel to Yoon's residence to beef up security ahead of Friday's detention attempt. The police did not carry out Choi's instruction, and Oh said the agency was reviewing whether Choi's actions constituted an obstruction of official duty. The agency has repeatedly called for Choi to instruct the presidential security service to comply with the execution of the detention warrant against Yoon. Choi hasn't commented. Yoon's lawyers argued the detention and search warrants against the president cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge — which would be Yoon. They also argue the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges and delegate police to detain Yoon. Yoon's lawyers on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against Oh and six other anti-corruption and police officers over Friday's detention attempt, which they claim was illegal. The lawyers also filed complaints against the country's acting national police chief, the acting defense minister and two Seoul police officials for ignoring the presidential security service's request to provide additional forces to block Yoon's detention attempt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-anti-corruption-agency-receives-new-court-warrant-to-detain-impeached-president-yoon-/7927069.html	2025-01-07T05:09:51-08:00	
Jean-Marie Le Pen, French far-right leader, dies at 96	Paris — Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France's far-right National Front who was known for fiery rhetoric against immigration and multiculturalism that earned him both staunch supporters and widespread condemnation, has died. He was 96. Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally as the party is now known, confirmed Le Pen's death in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday. A polarizing figure in French politics, Le Pen's controversial statements, including Holocaust denial, led to multiple convictions and strained his political alliances. Le Pen, who once reached the second round of the 2002 presidential election, was eventually estranged from his daughter, Marine Le Pen, who renamed his National Front party, kicked him out and transformed it into one of France's most powerful political forces while distancing herself from her father's extremist image Despite his exclusion from the party in 2015, Le Pen's divisive legacy endures, marking decades of French political history and shaping the trajectory of the far right. His death came at a crucial time for his daughter. She now faces a potential prison term and a ban on running for political office if convicted in the embezzling trial currently underway. A fixture for decades in French politics, the fiery Jean-Marie Le Pen was a wily political strategist and gifted orator who used his charisma to captivate crowds with his anti-immigration message. The portly, silver-haired son of a Breton fisherman viewed himself as a man with a mission — to keep France French under the banner of the National Front. Picking Joan of Arc as the party's patron saint, Le Pen made Islam, and Muslim immigrants, his primary target, blaming them for the economic and social woes of France. A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought in Indochina and Algeria, he led sympathizers into political and ideological battles with a panache that became a signature of his career. 'If I advance, follow me; if I die, avenge me; if I shirk, kill me,' Le Pen said at a 1990 party congress, reflecting the theatrical style that for decades fed the fervor of followers. Le Pen had recently been exempted from prosecution on health grounds from a high-profile trial over his party's suspected embezzlement of European Parliament funds that opened in September. Le Pen had 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and antisemitic hate speech. French judicial authorities placed Le Pen under legal guardianship in February at the request of his family as his health declined, French media reported. He had been in frail health for some time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jean-marie-le-pen-french-far-right-leader-dies-at-96-/7927063.html	2025-01-07T04:56:49-08:00	
France commemorates victims of Charlie Hebdo attacks 10 years on	Paris — France on Tuesday commemorated the victims of the deadly assault on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine 10 years ago that began a spate of Islamist militant attacks on the country and stoked a debate on press freedoms that still rages today. Two masked al Qaeda-linked gunmen with assault rifles stormed what were then the offices of Charlie Hebdo and killed 12 people. The attackers sought to avenge the Prophet Mohammad nearly a decade after the atheist and frequently provocative weekly published cartoons mocking the Prophet. The killings spurred an outpouring of national sympathy expressed in the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) and prompted an impassioned debate about freedom of expression and religion in secular France. 'There were scenes I will never forget,' former French President Francois Hollande told Reuters. 'We had to act and we did so responsibly, aware that we weren't finished and that there would be other tragedies. And there were.' President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will lead the commemorations, which include a wreath-laying ceremony and a minute's silence at three locations in the capital. Al Qaeda's Yemen branch had placed Charlie Hebdo's then editor, Stephane Charbonnier, on its 'wanted list' after the magazine first ran the images of the Prophet Mohammad in 2006. Two attackers born and raised in France stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices on Jan. 7, 2015, spraying gunfire. They killed eight members of the editorial team, including Charbonnier, and four other people before being shot dead by police. Over the next two days, another French-born man killed a policewoman and four Jewish hostages in a kosher supermarket in a Paris suburb. He was also shot dead by police. More than 250 people have been killed in France in Islamist violence since then, laying bare the struggle the country has faced to counter the threat posed by militants. Freedom of speech The anniversary has prompted renewed reflection in France about press freedoms. Hollande expressed concern that there was growing self-censorship stemming from fear. 'Should we publish drawings, project certain images, or compile reports when we know they may hurt personalities or communities? There is a form of self-censorship that has taken root,' he said. Charlie Hebdo published a special edition to mark the anniversary, depicting a man sitting on the butt of gun in front of the word 'Indestructible!' on its cover. 'Today the values of Charlie Hebdo — such as humor, satire, freedom of expression, ecology, secularism, feminism, to name a few - have never been so under threat,' it said in an editorial. Charlie Hebdo's no-taboo journalism divides France. For Muslims any depiction of the Prophet Mohammad is blasphemous. Critics of Charlie Hebdo accuse it of crossing the line and straying into Islamophobia by repeatedly publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. The magazine denies this and says it lampoons all religions, including Christianity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-commemorates-victims-of-charlie-hebdo-attacks-10-years-on-/7927008.html	2025-01-07T03:48:08-08:00	
Israeli military says it killed 3 militants in West Bank raids	Israel’s military said Tuesday it carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, killing at least three militants and arresting 18 others. The Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed two militants in the village of Tamun after they fired at troops. Israeli forces killed another militant during fighting in Taluza, while an Israeli soldier was wounded. The raids came a day after gunman attacked a bus and car near the West Bank town of Al-Funduq, killing three people and wounding seven others. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-says-it-killed-3-militants-in-west-bank-raids-/7926996.html	2025-01-07T03:26:20-08:00	
Blinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations	WASHINGTON/TOKYO — U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel cast a shadow over Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Japan on Tuesday for farewell meetings with Washington's most important ally in Asia. The rejection, announced on Friday, has jolted U.S. efforts to boost ties with Asian allies just as South Korea's political crisis potentially complicates a revived relationship between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo. The trilateral alliance is a key plank in the countries' efforts to counter China's military buildup. Investment into the U.S. could also be chilled, but analysts say any damage to the wider U.S.-Japan relationship will likely be limited given shared security concerns about China. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described Biden's decision to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel as 'perplexing.' Accompanied by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Blinken met Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo and will hold talks later in the day with Ishiba and other senior Japanese officials Numerous trips to Japan over the last four years 'is evidence, not just of the importance, but of the centrality the United States attaches to our partnership. President Biden asked me to come on this last trip to underscore that,' Blinken told Iwaya. 'We have, between our two countries, a partnership that started out focusing on bilateral issues, that worked on regional issues and that now is genuinely global,' he added. Ahead of his trip, the State Department said that Blinken wanted to build on the momentum of U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral cooperation. In Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea's handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have also reassured Seoul and Tokyo that he will support continuing to improve ties and advance military, economic and diplomatic cooperation to counter China and North Korea, Reuters reported ahead of Trump's Nov. 5 re-election. Tension, limited damage from Nippon Steel decision Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that Biden violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking their $14.9 billion merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They called for the U.S. federal court to overturn the decision. Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden's decision would make Blinken's Tokyo visit 'awkward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-visits-japan-as-nippon-steel-decision-weighs-on-relations-/7926990.html	2025-01-07T03:15:16-08:00	
Chinese vessel suspected of damaging undersea cable near Taiwan	Taiwan is investigating a Chinese-owned ship suspected of severing an undersea fiber-optic cable north of the island. While the incident caused minimal disruption to internet services, analysts say it reflects the vulnerability of Taiwan and its undersea infrastructure in the event of a Chinese military attack or blockade. 'It’s a vulnerability shared by a lot of countries in a globalized world,' said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official. 'The real challenge for Taiwan is how do they increase their resilience now [that] there is growing awareness that they could be intentionally held vulnerable through direct attacks that are difficult to attribute to a particular actor,' he told VOA by phone. Taiwan’s government-run telecommunications operator Chunghwa Telecom received a warning about damage to a subsea cable near the Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan Friday morning. Chunghwa Telecom said the disruption, which didn’t affect internet service across the island, may have been caused by a vessel dragging its anchor along the seabed where the undersea cable is located. Within hours, Taiwan’s coast guard dispatched a ship and found the Cameroon-flagged vessel Shunxin-39 in waters north of Taiwan. Taiwanese authorities ordered the ship to return to waters off Keelung Harbor for inspection but failed to board the ship due to rough weather conditions. Taipei has sought assistance from South Korea to investigate the ship, which is sailing toward the South Korean city of Busan. The Taiwanese coast guard said in a statement shared with VOA that the ship is owned by a Hong Kong company headed by a Chinese national. The seven crew members on board are Chinese nationals. In addition to carrying a Cameroon flag, Taiwanese authorities said the ship was also registered in Tanzania and seemed to operate under two sets of Automatic Identification System equipment, which shows the vessel’s basic information and coordinates. The coast guard said while the Chinese vessel’s intention remains unclear, the incident could be part of China’s gray zone operations that aim to exert pressure on Taiwan through irregular tactics short of combat. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunify with the island, with force if necessary. China has increased the frequency of its gray zone operations around Taiwan in recent years, regularly deploying military aircraft, naval vessels, and coast guard ships to airspaces and waters near Taiwan. Ray Powell, director of Stanford University’s Sealight project, which tracks Chinese maritime activities across the Indo-Pacific region, told VOA that the Chinese vessel has been operating between in waters near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor, South Korea’s Busan and along the Chinese coast under two different names, two different flags, and six different identification numbers over the last six months. 'Having at least six different registration numbers indicates this ship is devoted to being off-grid or hard to track,' he said in a phone interview. Powell said the vessel may be conducting a gray zone operation against Taiwan’s key infrastructure in the region. 'The reason we would classify the incident as a potential gray zone activity is because it’s hidden behind a private company based out of Hong Kong with an owner in China and flags of African countries, which keep the Chinese government from the vessel’s activities,' he told VOA. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., told VOA in a written response that it is unaware of the severing of the undersea cable near northern Taiwan, adding that Beijing 'has always welcomed and supported other countries and telecommunications companies laying international submarine cables in waters under China’s jurisdiction.' The incident comes amid a growing number of damages to undersea cables and pipelines caused by Chinese and Russian vessels in the Baltic Sea since 2023. It is also not the first time a Chinese vessel has been suspected of cutting undersea cables near Taiwan. In February 2023, Taiwanese authorities found evidence that two Chinese ships cut two internet cables near Taiwan’s outlying island of Matsu, causing a month-long internet outage on the tiny island. Since then, Taiwan has poured more resources into preparing for potential internet outages caused by damage to undersea cables. Last October, Chunghwa Telecom announced that signals from low-earth orbit satellites should cover the entire island. It was part of the efforts to reduce Taiwan’s dependence on undersea cables for external communication. During the first tabletop military exercise held by Taiwan’s presidential office last month, response to internet blackouts caused by damage to undersea cables was one of the scenarios simulated by top Taiwanese officials. While Chunghwa Telecom said the cable will be fixed later this month, Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs has vowed to secure more funding to help the telecom operator build more facilities to increase the island’s connection to international undersea cables. Some Taiwanese lawmakers also urged the coast guard to strengthen its capabilities to monitor activities in areas concentrated with undersea cables and update protocols in case similar incidents happen in the future. Some analysts say the coast guard needs to enhance its capabilities to address challenges posed by China, which have become more frequent in recent years. That includes monitoring 'irregular activities conducted by fishing or commercial vessels in waters near Taiwan’s undersea cables,' said Shen Ming-shih, a defense analyst at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA in a phone interview that Taiwan should also enhance its efficiency in repairing 'damaged undersea cables within the shortest amount of time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-vessel-suspected-of-damaging-undersea-cable-near-taiwan/7926977.html	2025-01-07T02:31:06-08:00	
Indonesia is admitted to the BRICS bloc of developing nations	SAO PAULO — Indonesia has been admitted as a full member of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, the group's presiding country, Brazil, announced Monday. Indonesia's candidacy was endorsed by BRICS leaders in August 2023, according to the foreign ministry of Brazil, which holds the group's presidency for 2025. However, the world's fourth most populous nation opted to formally join the bloc only after the formation of its newly elected government last year. 'The Brazilian government welcomes Indonesia's entry into the BRICS,' the government said in a statement. 'With the largest population and economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia shares with other members a commitment to reforming global governance institutions and contributes positively to deepening South-South cooperation.' Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a written statement Tuesday said that it reflects Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues, and its commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation. 'Indonesia views its membership in BRICS as a strategic step to increase collaboration and cooperation with other developing countries, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development,' said the statement. BRICS was formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, and South Africa was added in 2010. Last year, the alliance expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join but has not yet done so. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members and a few others have expressed interest. The organization was created as a counterweight to the Group of Seven, comprised of developed nations. Its name derives from an economic term used in the early 2000s to describe rising countries expected to dominate the global economy by 2050. Before Indonesia's membership, the bloc accounted for nearly 45% of the world's population and 35% of global gross domestic product, measured using purchasing power parity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-is-admitted-to-the-brics-bloc-of-developing-nations/7926970.html	2025-01-07T02:17:46-08:00	
Strong earthquake kills at least 95 people in western China near Mount Everest	BEIJING — A strong earthquake killed at least 95 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the high-altitude region of western China and across the border in Nepal. Officials in the region said at a brief news conference that 130 others were injured, state broadcaster CCTV said. Video on CCTV showed orange-suited rescue workers climbing piles of debris blocking homes in a heavily damaged village, while chunks that had been knocked off buildings littered streets and crushed cars in other areas. State media reported that about 1,000 houses were damaged and 130 people were injured in addition to the deaths, citing the Tibet earthquake relief headquarters. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the China-Nepal border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks. About 50 aftershocks were recorded in the three hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed after the quake. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people, the Ministry of Emergency Management. Two hundred soldiers joined the search, CCTV said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping. called for all-out efforts to rescue people, minimize casualties and resettle those whose homes were damaged. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, was dispatched to the area to guide the work. CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. In Nepal, authorities asked officials in the mountainous area near the epicenter to search for any casualties or damage. The National Emergency Operation Center in Kathmandu said people in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to houses. A police officer in Solukhumbu district, where Mount Everest is located, said by telephone that there were no reports of damage. The area, often crowded with climbers and hikers, was empty in the depth of winter. Many residents move to the south to avoid the harsh winter. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, the USGS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-earthquake-kills-at-least-95-people-in-western-china-near-mount-everest/7926895.html	2025-01-07T02:03:24-08:00	
What future awaits Syria’s Christian minority?	De facto Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa — whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) fighters drove President Bashar al-Assad from power last month — recently met with the Mideast nation's Christian leadership after a string of menacing attacks on religious minorities, giving some observers hope the sanctioned militants are ushering in an era of greater inclusion and tolerance, though others remain skeptical. Protests broke out in Syria over the Dec. 23 burning of a Christmas tree in a Christian-majority town in Hama amid other reports of harassment, prompting calls for the new Islamist authorities to take steps to safeguard ethnic minorities. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an independent U.K.-based human rights organization, 'Uzbek gunmen set fire to the Christmas tree in Al-Saqilibiya in Hama... that is inhabited by Christian residents.' The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported on Sharaa’s meeting with Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican clerics, including publishing pictures from the event. Syrian Catholic Archbishop Jacques Mourad of Homs, who attended the meeting, said Sharaa avoided using the term 'minority,' according to France-based La Croix International, a general-interest Catholic publication. 'He said that Christians and other groups are part of the Syrian people,' the archbishop told La Croix. 'He is aware that we Christians are foundational to this country.' Hope and skepticism Rafif Jouejati, nonresident scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, expressed optimism about the public rallies to demand accountability. 'If you watch the demonstrations taking place in Syria, you see immediately that people are out freely expressing their views,' she told VOA. 'This is not something we've been able to do in half a century.' She also shared her belief that Syria is moving in the right direction, dismissing concerns about a country transitioning to an Islamist state. But others aren't so sure. Richard Ghazal, executive director of In Defense of Christians, told VOA there was no 'difference [between HTS] and their organizational predecessor, Jabhat al-Nusra, which is the Nusra Front, al-Qaida or even [Islamic State].' 'They've taken the lessons from the mistakes of ISIS and al-Qaida,' he said, using another term for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL, IS or Daesh. 'They've used those to polish their message, their media engagement, and try to fool the West if not convince the West.' Although Sharaa was quick to emphasize the language of tolerance upon ousting Assad from power, declaring 'a Syria for everyone' the day after taking Damascus, Ghazal says how they will govern remains to be seen. Jouejati points to 2016, when HTS leaders distanced themselves from more radical militant groups. 'They have shown themselves to be far more moderate than their Islamist counterparts,' she said. 'We're observing a gradual shift away from any semblance of an Islamic dictatorship. Increasingly, they are beginning to resemble civilians more than soldiers.' Sanctions U.S. officials recently lifted a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, a decision that top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East Barbara Leaf called a 'policy decision' aimed at facilitating engagement with HTS. U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen in late December expressed hope for a swift end to the U.N. sanctions on Sharaa’s organization to help facilitate Syria's economic recovery. But Syria's economic rebound, say some observers, also requires an inclusive constitutional framework. 'The main challenge today, of course, is putting together a government that is in accordance and in adherence with U.N. resolution 2254,' said Ghazal said, which 'calls for a new Syrian government that actively involves the Syrian people and putting that government together with full sight and visibility to the international community and full transparency.' Jouejati envisions Syria evolving into a 'Middle Eastern-style democracy.' 'I believe we will have a country that is based on ... all human rights. I believe we have an opportunity to establish a state that is grounded on the rule of law, that incorporates transitional justice, that has free and fair elections, that has a separation of powers, and perhaps most importantly, a separation of religion and state,' she said. The 2023 U.S. Department of State Report on International Religious Freedom regarding Syria notes that approximately 2.5% of the population remaining in the country are Christians. Ghazal said he anticipates a new wave of emigration. Signs of intolerance Despite calls for inclusion by HTS leadership, Ghazal said signs of intolerance are already evident, including a ban on alcohol, the separation of women from men in public transport, and the presence of the Islamic State flags near some Damascus suburbs. 'This is very alarming that we're seeing this in Christian neighborhoods,' he told VOA. 'Signs like this tell you that while violence has not been witnessed on a large scale just yet, I'm afraid it may be looming in the future.' Jouejati emphasized the importance of unity and a shared Syrian identity for the country's future. 'I believe that right now [the] minorities’ biggest problem is their own fears,' she told VOA. 'We have seen and heard and, we've seen examples of this complete willingness to accept that there are Christian and other minorities. We have seen them being very respectful of everybody, not just minorities.' Nadine Maenza, of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat, recorded at least a dozen eyewitness accounts of attacks on religious and ethnic minorities in the Shehba region outside Aleppo in late December. 'Both HTS and the Turkish-backed militias have a history of severe religious violations against [minorities],' she told VOA. 'Atrocities are continuing against Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, and other religious minorities, but particularly we are seeing them from the Turkish-backed Islamist militias.' Ghazal said he anticipates an exodus of religious minorities from the country. 'The only reason the Christians who are currently in Syria have not migrated west to Europe, to the United States, Australia, it's not because they haven't wanted to,' he told VOA. 'It's simply because they haven't had the opportunity. And that's the tragic part.' Jouejati, however, described the reports of harassment as isolated cases rather than a consistent pattern of broader intolerance. 'I have seen some individual incidents where spoilers have instigated trouble, but I’ve also seen communities banding together,' she told VOA. 'Syrian Sunnis, who make up the majority, are reaching out to their Kurdish and Alawite and Christian and other counterparts to join hands. And I'm seeing an overwhelmingly positive response to being free of the Assad regime.' Asked to comment about Sharaa's direct engagement with Christian leaders, Italian Archbishop Mario Zenari, the pope’s envoy to Syria, said the fact of the meeting itself speaks volumes. 'This event would have been unimaginable only three weeks ago and the bishops and priests ... left with a sense of hope for Syria's future,' Zenari, who met with Syria's top diplomat last month, told Vatican News.

The next round of bitter cold and snow will hit the southern US	Annapolis, Maryland — The next round of bitter cold was set to envelop the southern U.S. on Tuesday, after the first significant winter storm of the year blasted a huge swath of the country with ice, snow and wind. The immense storm system brought disruption even to areas of the country that usually escape winter’s wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves. By early Tuesday, wind chill temperatures could dip as low as minus 10.5 C from Texas across the Gulf Coast, according to the National Weather Service. A low-pressure system is then expected to form as soon as Wednesday near south Texas, bringing the potential of snow to parts of the state that include Dallas, as well as to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip Monday, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations. Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday. A Kentucky truck stop was jammed with big rigs forced off an icy and snow-covered Interstate 75 on Monday just outside Cincinnati. A long-haul driver from Los Angeles carrying a load of rugs to Georgia, Michael Taylor said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches and was dealing with icy windshield wipers before he pulled off the interstate. 'It was too dangerous. I didn’t want to kill myself or anyone else,' he said. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip. Temperatures plunge across the country The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. dealt with bone-chilling cold and wind chills Monday, with temperatures in some areas far below normal. A cold weather advisory will take effect early Tuesday across the Gulf Coast. In Texas’ capital of Austin and surrounding cities, wind chills could drop as low as minus 9.4 C. The Northeast was expected to get several cold days. Transportation has been tricky Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after his patrol car was hit. Virginia State Police responded to at least 430 crashes Sunday and Monday, including one that was fatal. Police said other weather-related fatal accidents occurred Sunday near Charleston, West Virginia, and Monday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Kansas saw two deadly crashes over the weekend. More than 2,300 flights were canceled and at least 9,100 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday night, according to tracking platform FlightAware. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported that about 58% of arrivals and 70% of departures had been canceled. A record of more than 20 centimeters of snow fell Sunday at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, leading to dozens of flight cancellations that lingered into Monday. About 10 centimeters fell Monday across the Cincinnati area, where car and truck crashes shut at least two major routes leading into downtown. More snow and ice are expected In Indiana, snow covered stretches of Interstate 64, Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 41, leading authorities to plead with people to stay home. 'It’s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a half hour the roadways are completely covered again,' State Police Sgt. Todd Ringle said. Tens of thousands are without power Many were in the dark as temperatures plunged. More than 218,000 customers were without power Monday night across Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. In Virginia’s capital city, a power outage caused a temporary malfunction in the water system, officials said Monday afternoon. Richmond officials asked those in the city of more than 200,000 people to refrain from drinking tap water or washing dishes without boiling the water first. The city also asked people to conserve their water, such as by taking shorter showers. City officials said they were working nonstop to bring the system back online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-next-round-of-bitter-cold-and-snow-will-hit-the-southern-us-/7926920.html	2025-01-06T23:48:31-08:00	
Strong earthquake kills at least 53 people in western China	BEIJING — A strong earthquake killed at least 53 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the region of western China and across the border in Nepal. The official Xinhua News Agency said 62 other people were injured, citing the regional disaster relief headquarters. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people in the rubble, the Ministry of Emergency Management said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicenter. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, the USGS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-earthquake-kills-at-least-53-people-in-western-china/7926895.html	2025-01-06T22:28:20-08:00	
How Carter’s covert aid to Afghan rebels redefined his foreign policy record	President Ronald Reagan is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union, in part by helping Afghan rebels, but it was the administration of President Jimmy Carter that laid the groundwork. Considered a foreign policy novice by many when he entered the White House, Carter made the early decision to provide covert aid to Afghan insurgents months before the Soviet invasion. The move offers a window into one of the defining issues of his presidency, showing a president unafraid to confront the Soviets while pursuing a policy of détente. 'I think people’s image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he’s done after he left office. [But] he definitely had a ruthless side to him, and he had a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons,' said David Gibbs, a history professor at the University of Arizona. The covert aid program initiated under Carter became the backbone of the Afghan insurgency, setting the stage for the Soviet Union’s eventual withdrawal in 1989. In a bold move six months before the Soviets' December 1979 invasion, Carter signed a secret directive known as a 'presidential finding' that authorized the CIA to provide nonlethal aid to rebels fighting Afghanistan’s Soviet-backed communist government. That finding stayed under wraps for nearly two decades, coming to light only when several Carter administration officials, including former CIA Director Robert Gates and national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, disclosed its existence in the 1990s, suggesting the Carter administration aimed to lure the Soviets into a Vietnam-style quagmire. ‘Afghan trap’ Brzezinski’s revelations were the most striking. In a 1998 interview with a French magazine, Carter’s Polish-born, ardently anti-communist adviser denied provoking the Soviets but claimed the administration had 'knowingly increased the probability' of a Soviet invasion. Calling the program 'an excellent idea,' he said it had the 'effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap.' Although Brzezinski later disputed the accuracy of the interview and never repeated the claim, the so-called 'Afghan trap' thesis gained traction, with critics excoriating the Carter administration for instigating the Soviet invasion and causing decades of conflict in Afghanistan. Among scholars who see the aid program as a deliberate provocation, Gibbs said he was initially loath to read too much into the Brzezinski interview before becoming convinced of its veracity. As Gibbs described it to VOA, a military aide once told historian Jonathan Haslam that Brzezinski, upon learning of the Soviet invasion, 'pumped his first in the air in triumph and said, ‘They’ve taken the bait!’' 'The implication was that the decision to supply aid to the mujahideen was bait,' Gibbs said. 'That, to me, is a strong indication that what he said is true, because it was said twice over a period of time, and it’s from the horse’s mouth.' The Afghan trap thesis has permeated the works of other prominent experts, although most now dismiss it as baseless, according to historian Conor Tobin of the University College Dublin, who has researched it. The problem with the theory, Tobin argues, is that it views the Carter administration’s involvement in Afghanistan through a 21st century lens, 'working backwards from the events of 9/11.' 'They rely almost exclusively on Gates’ memoirs, the controversial French interview and other circumstantial and limited anecdotal evidence without exploring the subject in detail, and without using any other sources to corroborate the statements made,' Tobin told VOA via email. A close look at recently declassified Carter-era documents tells a different story, Tobin said. 'It reveals that there was no attempt to ensnare the Soviet Union in the Afghan trap, and U.S. policies were in fact marginal in leading to the Soviet military intervention,' he said. Nonlethal aid What is not up for debate, however, is that the aid program was launched in response to rising Soviet influence in Afghanistan. A communist coup in April 1978 toppled the government of President Mohammad Daoud. The new regime then initiated radical reforms, sparking public opposition and eventually a full-blown insurgency. According to Tobin, the Carter administration initially took a 'wait-and-see' approach. That policy ended with the kidnapping and murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs the following February. Brzezinski then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan. 'Should we help any insurgents?' he asked an aide to investigate, according to Tobin. 'With whom would we have to work?' A popular revolt in the western Afghan city of Herat, however, 'led to a shift in attitude in Washington and the consensus began to slide towards a more active role,' Tobin wrote in his analysis, 'The Myth of the ‘Afghan Trap’.' CIA operatives sprang into action, developing a plan of action while reaching out to U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Several options were formulated, ranging from small-scale propaganda campaigns and nonlethal support to lethal arms supplies and military training via a third country. After determining that military assistance may 'provoke vigorous Soviet countermeasures,' the administration settled on nonlethal aid. 'The decision-making process demonstrated caution, rather than an effort to induce an invasion,' Tobin wrote. On July 3, 1979, Carter authorized the CIA to provide up to $695,000 in aid to the insurgents. By mid-August, $575,000 of the funds had been allocated for cash, medical equipment and radio transmitters to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, who then delivered them to the mujahideen, according to Tobin’s account. The aid program, says Tobin, was modest but significant in two key respects. It helped establish links with the mujahideen through Pakistani intelligence that would prove invaluable after the Soviet invasion. It also underscored American resolve to allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, reassuring them at a time when concerns about diminishing U.S. influence in the region were mounting. The aid program came against a backdrop of escalating Cold War tensions. The Iranian Revolution of February 1979 had robbed the U.S. of a key strategic ally in the region. Rather than seeking to provoke the Soviets, Brzezinski worried about a 'creeping intervention' in Afghanistan, fearing ‘’Moscow would continue to expand its influence until a de factor invasion had taken place,’’ Tobin wrote. 'The objectives in mid-1979 were essentially to do something, anything, to counter the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,' Tobin said. Historian Scott Kaufman of Francis Marion University and author of a book on Carter’s foreign policy, said the late president also had to consider his bid for re-election the following year. 'He was already under attack for having ‘lost’ Nicaragua to communists and for being ‘soft’ on the Soviet Union,' Kaufman told VOA via email. 'How would it look to voters if Carter, who wanted to get SALT II [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] approved, made moves that encouraged what would be seen by them as further Soviet aggression.' ‘Carter Doctrine’ Kaufman took issue with the popular perception of Carter as a foreign policy novice. Though he lacked the foreign policy experience of a Richard Nixon or even Gerald Ford, Carter sat on the Trilateral Commission and had traveled overseas as governor of Georgia, Kaufman noted. 'That said, his support for the mujahideen reflected a foreign policy that since at least 1978 reflected a hardening insofar as U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union,' he said. Carter’s tougher stance, Kaufman said, was driven by growing anti-Soviet sentiment in Congress, Brzezinski’s influence, and his personal disdain for Soviet repression and machinations. 'This does not mean that he had given up on seeking detente with the Soviets, as reflected by his desire to get SALT II ratified,' he said. 'But his foreign policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. [Soviet Union] demonstrated a preparedness to take a harder line.' Nothing demonstrated Carter's resolve more forcefully than the 'Carter Doctrine,' his bold Persian Gulf policy adopted in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Unveiling the new policy during his 1980 State of the Union address, Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use 'any means necessary' to prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf region. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Carter administration upped the ante. On December 28, 1979, the day after Soviet commandos assassinated Afghan President Hafizullah Amin in Kabul, Carter signed a new finding that authorized the supply of weapons and training for the mujahideen. The first batch of weapons arrived in Pakistan in less than two weeks. Carter went on to lose the 1980 election to Reagan, whose administration largely continued Carter’s Afghan policy for several years before dramatically building up the covert aid program to the tune of several hundred million dollars a year. Instead of merely harassing the Soviets, the Reagan administration sought its defeat, according to Tobin. 'The criticism of the Carter administration as weak on defense, therefore, is unjustified, with Carter largely laying the groundwork for the renewed global containment of the 1980s,' Tobin said. 'So, despite enduring orthodox assessments of Carter as a foreign policy failure, he departed office in January 1981 leaving a clear foreign policy direction for the incoming Reagan administration that arguably contributed to the end of the Cold War a decade later — an outcome that was almost incomprehensible as the Carter administration took office in January 1977.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-carter-s-covert-aid-to-afghan-rebels-redefined-his-foreign-policy-record/7926876.html	2025-01-06T21:28:12-08:00

Russia claims capture of town in Ukraine’s Donetsk region	Russia’s military said Monday its forces captured an important town in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian officials cited tens of thousands of Russian casualties in the fighting in Russia’s Kursk region. The Russian Defense Ministry said its control of the town of Kurakhove after several months of fighting for the logistics hub will allow the Russian military to more quickly advance elsewhere in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials did not confirm the loss of Kurakhove on Monday, with the military’s General Staff saying in a late Monday report that Russian forces had launched attacks on Ukrainian positions in the town. Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Monday that the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, which began five months ago, had caused 38,000 Russian military casualties. 'The Russians have deployed their strongest units to Kursk, including soldiers from North Korea. Importantly, all this manpower cannot now be redirected to other fronts – neither to the Donetsk region, nor against Sumy, the Kharkiv region or Zaporizhzhia,' Zelenskyy said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier Monday that North Korea and China are the 'biggest ongoing drivers' allowing Russia to carry out its war in Ukraine, and that security assurances will need to be a part of potential future negotiations ending the conflict. Speaking during a visit to South Korea, Blinken said North Korean supplies of artillery, ammunition and troops, along with Chinese support for Russia’s military industrial base are giving the Russian military the backing it needs to continue carrying out the fight it started in February 2022. He said North Korea is already seeing a return on its involvement in the conflict in the form of Russian military equipment and training for North Korea troops. 'We believe it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK,' Blinken said. With only two weeks left in the Biden administration, the United States has been rushing to send remaining authorized aid to Ukraine amid uncertainty about how President-elect Donald Trump may approach the war. Blinken said Monday the U.S. has been trying to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself, and to have the 'strongest possible hand' at a future negotiating table with Russia. 'If there is going to be, at some point, a ceasefire, it's not going to be, in Putin's mind, 'game over',' Blinken said. 'His imperial ambitions remain, and what he will seek to do is to rest, to refit, and eventually to re-attack.' Blinken said it is necessary to have an 'adequate deterrent in place so that he doesn't do that, so that he thinks twice – three times – before engaging in any re-aggression.' Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 79 of the 128 drones that Russian forces deployed overnight in attack targeting multiple Ukrainian regions. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Cherkasy reported damage to residential buildings and a grain warehouse from falling drone debris. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 12 Ukrainian aerial drones, all in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attacks injured three people and damaged several residential buildings.

U.S. accuses Russia of funding both sides of Sudan's war	UNITED NATIONS — The United States accused Russia at the United Nations on Monday of funding the two warring parties in Sudan, an apparent step up from Washington's previous assertion that Moscow was playing both sides of the conflict to advance its political objectives. The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. In November Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that called on the warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid. The remaining 14 council members voted in favor of the text. 'Russia chose obstruction: standing alone as it voted to imperil civilians, while funding both sides of the conflict – yes, that's what I said: both sides,' the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council on Monday, without giving further details. When asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N. said Washington was aware of Russia's 'ongoing interest in Sudan's gold trade' and condemns any material support for the warring parties – 'whether it be through illicit gold trading or the provision of military equipment.' 'We believe Sudanese authorities' gold mining cooperation with sanctioned Russian entities and individuals could prove inimical to Sudan's long-term interests and the aspirations of the Sudanese people for an end to the war,' the U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson said. In response, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said: 'We regret that the U.S. tries to judge other world powers by its own yardstick.' 'It's obvious that in the Pax Americana which our American colleagues try to preserve at any price, relations with other countries are built only on their exploitation and criminal schemes aimed at U.S. enrichment,' he said. Reuters was unable to immediately contact Sudan's warring parties for comment. In December, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected what he called 'fabrications spread by Western countries and their media' that Moscow was trying to play both sides to gain an advantage from the war. At what she said would likely be her last council meeting, Thomas-Greenfield became visibly emotional while addressing her counterparts on Sudan, a crisis that has been a focus for her during her four years at the world body. 'For all the disappointment that I couldn't do more, that we – all of us – didn't do more – I still remain hopeful,' she said. 'Hopeful that the representatives sitting around this table – the colleagues who have become friends – will continue this sacred mission, this ultimate responsibility.' Thomas-Greenfield was appointed by President Joe Biden. Donald Trump will succeed Biden on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/u-s-accuses-russia-of-funding-both-sides-of-sudan-s-war/7926845.html	2025-01-06T19:34:02-08:00	
US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military	WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military. The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday. The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the 'Section 1260H list,' designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register. U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was 'clearly a mistake.' It added: 'We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.' CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it 'is not engaged in any military related activities.' A Quectel spokesperson said the company 'does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error.' The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment. Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks. Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was 'reckless' for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations. 'The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,' he said. 'The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions.' Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments. U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility -- a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday. While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies. Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations but remain on the updated list. The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijing-s-military/7926843.html	2025-01-06T19:23:10-08:00	
Powerful earthquake hits holy city in China's Tibet	BEIJING — A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near one of Tibet's holiest cities on Tuesday morning, the China Earthquake Networks Center said, damaging buildings around Shigatse and sending people running to the streets in neighboring Nepal and India. The trembler at 9:05 a.m. had an epicenter depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), the report added, revising the magnitude from an earlier 6.9. Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video showing the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road. Reuters was able to confirm the location from nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery. The date could not be verified independently. Tremors were felt in Nepal's capital Kathmandu some 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, where residents ran from their houses. Tremors were felt in the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal. As walls shook, people rushed out of their homes and apartments to open areas. So far, no reports of any damage or loss to property have been received, officials in India said. A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage. Southwestern parts of China are frequently hit by earthquakes. A huge quake in Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people. According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, there have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 km of the Shigatse quake in the past five years, all of which were smaller than the one that struck on Tuesday morning. In 2015, a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in neighboring Nepal, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in that country's worst earthquake.	https://www.voanews.com/a/powerful-earthquake-hits-holy-city-in-china-s-tibet/7926841.html	2025-01-06T19:20:57-08:00	
North Korea's Kim oversees successful test of new hypersonic missile	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a successful test of a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile (IRBM) on Monday, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, pledging to accelerate the country's nuclear and missile capabilities. It was North Korea's first missile launch since Nov. 5 and coincided with a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to South Korea, where he pledged bilateral and trilateral cooperation including Japan to respond to Pyongyang's growing military threats. The test occurred less than two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim during his first term and has touted their personal rapport, returns to office. The missile was fired on the outskirts of Pyongyang and flew some 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) at 12 times the speed of sound and reached the maximum altitude of nearly 100 km before accurately landing at a target off the east coast, KCNA said. New carbon fiber composite materials were used in the missile's engine, and it could 'effectively penetrate any dense defense barrier and inflict a serious military blow on the opponent,' it said. Kim hailed the missile as a powerful weapon to cope with security threats posed by hostile forces and the changing regional security environment. 'The development of new-type hypersonic missile is mainly aimed to steadily put the country's nuclear war deterrent on an advanced basis by making the means of changing the war situation, the weapon system to which no one can respond, the linchpin of strategic deterrence,' he said, according to KCNA. South Korea's military said on Monday a suspected IRBM traveled more than 1,100 kilometers (690 miles) eastwards before falling into the sea. Blinken condemned the latest launch together with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, and also warned of Pyongyang's deepening ties with Moscow, including illicit cooperation on space and satellite technology. North Korea has been developing a new solid-fuel hypersonic IRBM amid an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets that are difficult to track and intercept. Last year's tests featured a new solid-fuel design and carried what Pyongyang said was a hypersonic glide vehicle, a warhead designed to be able to maneuver and evade missile defenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-oversees-successful-test-of-new-hypersonic-missile/7926830.html	2025-01-06T18:53:16-08:00	
Homes talk and tables walk at AI-dominated Consumer Electronics Show	LAS VEGAS — Home appliances that do chores, cars that know your favorite cafe, and robot pets aiming to please are among artificial intelligence-infused offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show opening Tuesday. All these will compete for attention at the annual CES extravaganza in Las Vegas, as vendors behind the scenes seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. AI is once again a major theme of the show, along with autonomous vehicles ranging from tractors and boats to lawn mowers and golf club trollies. South Korean consumer electronics giant LG kicked off a media day Monday by outlining a vision for 'Affectionate Intelligence' in which home appliances watch over people — from tracking how well they sleep to making sure they remember umbrellas when rain is in the forecast. 'At LG, we're seamlessly integrating AI into physical living spaces around us,' said CEO William Cho. 'We see space not merely as a physical location but as an environment where holistic experiences come to life — across the Home, Mobility, Commercial and even Virtual spaces.' Before the show floor even opened, vendors enticed visitors with electric roller skates, hologram booths for life-size remote collaboration, and even a robot that looked like a lamp affixed to the top of a walking table. Most offerings boasted being enhanced with AI. 'Everybody is going to be talking about AI ... whether it is there or not,' Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP. AI on the move CES will also be a gigantic auto show, with carmakers and those supplying software and parts showing off self-driving and automated safety capabilities. 'CES has been an auto show for a while now, and if anything, it is more so this year,' said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump is expected to reduce regulatory speed bumps regarding autonomous vehicles. And while still far from being a part of everyday life, flying cars will be part of the CES scene, according to independent tech analyst Rob Enderle. 'You should start seeing flying vehicles you can buy,' Enderle said. 'Getting approval to fly them is a whole other matter.' Robots designed to handle work tasks or be comforting companions — and even adorable pets — are among CES' exhibits. Gadgets for calming the mind, beautifying the body, or helping get a sound night's sleep are on display as tech continues to seep into every aspect of existence. 'Digital health is going to be huge,' said Greengart. 'We are seeing a lot more tech being worn or used to track your health markers.' AI-enhanced tech will also be infusing homes, from a spice dispenser that 'learns' a cook's taste and robot swimming pool cleaners. Tariff anxiety? Tariffs talked about by Trump would raise costs for imported items, and that will likely be on the minds of CES attendees targeting the U.S. market, according to analysts. A lot of the products at the show have imported components, and if Trump hits Canada, China and Mexico with tariffs, it will mean a spike in prices, analyst Enderle said. 'There will be a lot of concerned vendors at CES,' Enderle said of the tariff trepidation. Talk at CES will include how to navigate supply chain constraints that could be caused by tariffs, according to Greengart. 'But a lot of the talk will happen behind closed doors to not anger the coming administration,' he added. Chinese companies with significant U.S. presence, like smart television rivals TCL and Hisense, are at CES. But Greengart warns of a 'growing bifurcation of market between China and the rest of the world' as trade frictions play out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/homes-talk-and-tables-walk-at-ai-dominated-consumer-electronics-show-/7926828.html	2025-01-06T18:45:07-08:00

US dramatically shrinks Guantanamo prisoner population to 15 men	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's administration slashed the prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba by nearly half on Monday, sending 11 detainees to Oman. The U.S. military said only 15 detainees remained there after the transfer, following a major push toward closing the facility by Biden's administration in its final days in office. The detention center was first opened on Jan. 11, 2002, by President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects and 'illegal enemy combatants' during the U.S. 'War on Terror' following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Guantanamo Bay housed roughly 680 prisoners at the detention center's peak in 2003, according to Pentagon data. The latest transfer of the 11 men, all of whom are from Yemen, leaves the U.S. naval base in Cuba with fewer detainees than when it opened with the arrival of prisoners from Afghanistan. 'The United States appreciates the willingness of the government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,' the U.S. military said in a statement. The Pentagon named the 11 men transferred as: Uthman Abd al-Rahim Muhammad Uthman, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, Khalid Ahmed Qassim, Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi, Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani, Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah, Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi, Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash, Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj and Abd Al-Salam Al-Hilah. Of the remaining 15 detainees, the Pentagon said three are eligible for transfer and an equal number are eligible for a periodic review board to examine their cases. The remainder have been charged or convicted of war crimes. The facility has long been criticized by human rights groups and legal advocates over potential breaches of international human rights laws and conditions at the camp.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dramatically-shrinks-guantanamo-prisoner-population-to-15-men/7926795.html	2025-01-06T17:01:30-08:00

Biden will honor tribal requests by designating 2 new national monuments in California	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California, in part to honor two tribes, a person familiar with the decision said Monday. The proclamation will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the Sattitla National Monument in Northern California, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans that were to be announced Tuesday in California. The declaration bars drilling and mining and other development on the 600,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) area in Southern California and roughly 200,000 acres (800 square kilometers) in Northern California. The establishment of the new monuments was first reported in The Washington Post. Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is in New Orleans on Monday meeting with the families of the victims in the New Year's attack in the French Quarter and was heading to California later Monday. The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president’s 'America the Beautiful' initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030, and addressing climate change. The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sattitla National Monument. A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, at the start of 2023. The area would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River. Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites. The California Legislature passed a resolution in August 2024 to urge Biden to establish the Chuckwalla National Monument and another National Park Service-managed national monument adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, as well as the Kw’tsan National Monument, which would border Mexico and Arizona. Tribal leaders have also called for the Chuckwalla monument to honor tribal sovereignty to include local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations. 'The protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,' the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. 'Tribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.' In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California — the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved. Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to receive tribal land back from the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-will-honor-tribal-requests-by-designating-2-new-national-monuments-in-california-/7926771.html	2025-01-06T16:44:33-08:00

Minneapolis to revamp police training, force policies after George Floyd's murder	MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis City Council on Monday approved an agreement with the federal government to overhaul the city's police training and use-of-force policies in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. The deal incorporates and builds on changes the Minneapolis Police Department has made since Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white officer in 2020, prompting a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. The 171-page agreement, filed in federal court shortly after the council's 12-0 vote, says the department will require its officers to 'promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their activities.' It says officers must 'carry out their law enforcement duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every person.' And it says they must not allow race, gender or ethnicity 'to influence any decision to use force, including the amount or type of force used.' The agreement, known as a consent decree, means the department will be under long-term court supervision. It had been under negotiation since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city’s police in June 2023. The report alleged that police systematically discriminated against racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the safety of people in custody for years before Floyd’s killing. The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used excessive force, including 'unjustified deadly force,' and violated the rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech. An independent monitor will oversee the changes, and a judge must approve them. During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court approval. The council approved the deal 12-0 Monday during a brief public vote that followed an hours-long, closed-door discussion. 'I’d like to thank our community for standing together, united in this, and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very long and challenging journey,' Council President Elliott Payne said after the vote. 'We’re just beginning, and we know we have a long way to go. Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our city.' Council Member Robin Wonsley said in a statement before the vote that she has 'no faith that the Trump administration will be a serious partner' in implementing the agreement. 'Having a federal consent decree signed and in place is valuable to police reform efforts, but we need to be sober about the fact that it will take local political will to hold the city and the (Mayor Jacob) Frey administration accountable to implementing and enforcing the terms of the consent decree,' she said. A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state agency issued its own blistering report in 2022. The state investigation found that the city's police had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade. The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to high-profile deaths at the hands of police. It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville, Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor is awaiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the beating death of Tyre Nichols. Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O’Hara as police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in Newark, New Jersey. If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and state consent decrees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/minneapolis-to-revamp-police-training-force-policies-after-george-floyd-s-murder/7926520.html	2025-01-06T15:38:38-08:00	
Two Indian companies indicted in US for importing ingredients used in opioid fentanyl	NEW YORK — Two Indian chemical companies have been indicted for allegedly importing ingredients for the highly addictive opioid fentanyl into the United States and Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. Athos Chemicals and Raxuter Chemicals, both based in Gujarat, were each charged in Brooklyn with distributing the ingredients and conspiring to distribute them. Raxuter and senior executive Bhavesh Lathiya, 36, were also charged with smuggling, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Lathiya was arrested on Saturday in New York and ordered detained pending trial, after prosecutors called him a flight risk and a substantial danger to the community. 'The Justice Department is targeting every link in fentanyl trafficking supply chains that span countries and continents and too often end in tragedy in the United States,' U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. A federal public defender representing Lathiya declined to comment. Athos and Raxuter did not immediately respond to similar requests outside business hours. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 times more powerful than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. Opioids accounted for about 82,000 U.S. deaths in 2022, 10 times the number in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prosecutors said that since February 2024, the defendants supplied 'precursor' chemicals they knew would be used to make fentanyl, and hid their efforts by mislabeling packages, falsifying customs forms, and making false declarations at border crossings. One indictment said that in October 2024 video calls with an undercover agent posing as a fentanyl manufacturer, Lathiya agreed to sell 20 kilograms of the precursor chemical 1-boc-4-piperidone, and suggested mislabeling them as an antacid. Lathiya did this after the agent told him his Mexico clients were 'very happy with the quality of what you sent me,' and with the 'yield' from the resulting fentanyl, the indictment said. The other indictment said Athos agreed last February to sell 100 kilograms of the same chemical to a known drug trafficker in Mexico who was making fentanyl in connection with a drug trafficking organization. Lathiya faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted, the Justice Department said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-indian-companies-indicted-in-us-for-importing-ingredients-used-in-opioid-fentanyl-/7926509.html	2025-01-06T15:10:55-08:00	
Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani found in contempt of court in defamation case	NEW YORK — A judge on Monday found Rudy Giuliani to be in civil contempt of court in a case brought by two Georgia election workers that the former New York City mayor falsely accused of trying to help steal the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation judgment. 'The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance,' Liman said. The contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once known as 'America's Mayor' for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying that they tried to help steal the 2020 election. Giuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes. Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020 election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona that he aided Trump's failed attempt to overturn his loss. In July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic records to the two election workers. A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment. Liman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment Giuliani would face for contempt. But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he owns. Liman said he would presume Giuliani's lack of response suggested the answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could be turned over. Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment, the title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is still pending. Giuliani, 80, has claimed that his day-to-day life has been upended by the two election workers, making it difficult to obtain necessary paperwork, and that he has not 'willfully disobeyed' any court orders. Giuliani's lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, said on Monday that the time frame for Giuliani to respond to the election workers' demands was tight but that he sought to comply. 'There's been substantial compliance,' Cammarata said. 'There is no defiance to the court.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-new-york-city-mayor-rudy-giuliani-found-in-contempt-of-court-in-defamation-case-/7926497.html	2025-01-06T14:56:10-08:00	
Louisiana reports 1st bird flu-related death in US, state agency says	WASHINGTON — The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that a U.S. patient hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu had died, the country's first death from an outbreak of the virus that has sickened dozens of people and millions of poultry and cattle. Nearly 70 people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu since April, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of them livestock workers exposed to sick chickens or dairy cattle. The patient in Louisiana, the first person in the country to be hospitalized with the virus, contracted bird flu after exposure to a combination of backyard chickens and wild birds, said Louisiana health officials. The patient was hospitalized on Dec. 18, state health officials said. The patient was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, the officials said. 'While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk,' the department said in a statement. The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/louisiana-reports-1st-bird-flu-related-death-in-us-state-agency-says-/7926498.html	2025-01-06T14:54:39-08:00	
Post-Assad Syria faces challenges in building unified military	WASHINGTON — The newly appointed defense minister in Syria’s caretaker government, Murhaf Abu Qasra, has been holding meetings with various rebel factions in the country, aiming to bring them under the command of Syria’s defense ministry. Abu Qasra said in a statement Monday that such meetings 'aim to develop a roadmap for stabilizing the military’s organizational structure.' Syria’s new authorities announced shortly after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad last month that unifying all rebel groups and other armed forces under a national military would be a top priority in the post-Assad era. Dozens of rebel factions and armed forces emerged over the course of Syria’s conflict, which began in 2011, with the aim of either fighting the Assad regime or protecting local communities. Before taking up his current role as defense minister, Abu Qasra served as a key commander in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel group that spearheaded the 11-day offensive culminating in Assad’s ouster on Dec. 8, 2024. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization with former ties to al-Qaida, has emerged as the dominant force within Syria’s new leadership. Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, recently called on all armed groups in the country to join a unified military, pledging to dissolve the HTS as part of the process. Nicholas Heras, a Middle East expert at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said the HTS-led caretaker government is facing the reality that there are heavily armed, well-organized actors within Syria who mistrust its intentions and do not see it as the permanent successor to the Assad regime. 'The consequence of Syria’s multi-factional civil war is that despite the relative strength of HTS compared to other armed groups in western Syria, the HTS-led caretaker government is still limited in its resources and operating under the shadow of distrust and terrorist designation from powerful foreign actors,' he told VOA. One of the major groups that the interim government seeks to integrate into the Defense Ministry is the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF, a Kurdish-led military alliance, has been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. It controls a vast territory in northeast Syria, but Turkey considers it a terrorist organization and has vowed to eliminate it unless its fighters disarm. Since Assad’s fall, Turkish-backed Syrian proxies have intensified their clashes with the SDF in parts of northern Syria, dislodging them from several towns in Aleppo province. The SDF has stated it will not lay down its arms without a genuine political process in Syria, one in which it can play a key role in shaping the country’s future military. Last week, a meeting took place between Syria’s de facto leader al-Sharaa and SDF officials in Damascus, but details of the discussion haven’t been disclosed. 'While I'm sure the group wants to do the right thing by the Syrian people and for the country of Syria, when locked in an existential fight against a powerful military like Turkey, not to mention threats from a resurgent Islamic State and other non-state armed groups, it would be crazy for the SDF to unilaterally disarm,' said Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. 'The SDF's number one priority is survival, and Syria is not the kind of country where any minority group can afford to readily give up its arms, even if a government promises security and safety,' he told VOA. Analyst Heras believes there are limitations in the power of HTS to impose its order on Syria at this point, 'because the Druze community in Sweida [in the south] doubts that HTS can restrain the more extremist elements in its coalition, the SDF will not surrender the autonomy of its region of control, and other actors such as the Southern Operations Room, the Turkish-backed Turkmen majority groups in northern Syria, the Christian militias in Homs, and the slowly gathering Alawite clans in the mountains by the coast are all demanding a stake in the future of Syria.' He said militias in Syria, even many within the Sunni Arab community, 'want HTS to bask in the glory of dealing the death blow to the Assad regime, and then exit left to allow a future Syrian state to take center stage. At this time, however, many of the Syrian militias believe that HTS is looking to replace the Baath [the former ruling party] with its own form of authoritarianism.' Myles Caggins, a former spokesperson for the global coalition against IS, said the new government in Syria should take inclusive steps to secure international support.

Venezuela’s opposition leader Gonzalez meets with Biden	Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez who claims he won last year’s presidential election against incumbent President Nicolas Maduro met with U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday. After the White House meeting, Gonzalez said he had 'a long, fruitful and cordial conversation' with Biden. 'We, of course, thanked the United States government for the support it has given us in this fight for democratic recovery in Venezuela.' Gonzalez also said he expects a close relationship with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The meeting between Gonzalez and Biden happened just days before Maduro is set to be sworn into office Friday for a third term. Maduro has continued to claim that he was the victor in Venezuela’s July election, despite the fact that electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts following the election. The opposition maintains its collection of tally sheets from more than 80% of Venezuela’s electronic voting machines prove that Gonzalez was the clear winner of the July election. The U.S., most European countries and several Latin American countries have rejected Maduro’s claims to victory, which have been recognized by Venezuela’s top court and electoral authority. The controversial election sparked mass protests which left nearly 30 people dead and over 2,400 arrested. Gonzalez, a 75-year-old former diplomat, has been living in exile in Spain since the election, but has promised to return to Venezuela to be sworn into office Friday. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Monday Gonzalez would be 'arrested and tried if he sets foot in Venezuela.' Venezuela is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to Gonzalez’s capture.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-opposition-leader-gonzalez-meets-with-biden/7926464.html	2025-01-06T14:09:13-08:00	
Palestinian refugee camp at Yarmouk illustrates brutality of Syria’s civil war	The Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, on the outskirts of Damascus, offers a glimpse of the brutality of Syria’s civil war.

US eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place	WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria's transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last month. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license lasting six months that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transactions. The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered by more than a decade of war but indicates a limited show of U.S. support for the new transitional government. The general license underscores America's commitment to ensuring its sanctions 'do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance,' a Treasury Department statement said. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency 'will continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance in Syria.' Since Assad's ouster, representatives from the nation's new de facto authorities have said the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world. The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month. The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS; Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida; and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad's ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of his crackdown on protesters and sanctioned him and his Russian and Iranian associates. Most of the Western-led sanctions targeted Assad and his associates for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across Syria's porous borders. With Assad out of the picture, Syria's new authorities hope the international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again. Syria's infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half the population won't know where its next meal will come from as inflation surges. The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive 2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over 59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn't be fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the U.S. announcing some humanitarian exemptions. Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads work on Syria, said ahead of the general license issuance: 'There is a general agreement,' among regional and international governments, 'that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos.' 'The only path forward is to engage positively,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-eases-restrictions-on-syria-while-keeping-sanctions-in-place-/7926421.html	2025-01-06T13:23:55-08:00	
US cyber watchdog: No signs Treasury breach hit other federal agencies	WASHINGTON — The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA said Monday there was 'no indication' the recently reported breach at the U.S. Treasury Department had affected any other federal agency. Late last month the U.S. Treasury reported that an unspecified number of computers had been compromised by Chinese hackers following a breach at contractor BeyondTrust, which provides cybersecurity services. BeyondTrust said last month that a limited number of clients were affected but has not elaborated. 'As the forensic investigation is ongoing, BeyondTrust is unable to confirm the other customers who may or may not have been impacted,' the company said Monday in an email. The Washington Post has reported that the hackers breached the U.S. Treasury office that administers economic sanctions, aiming to steal information about Chinese entities that the U.S. government might be considering designating for financial sanctions. Republican lawmakers have demanded a briefing about the breach, which is the latest in a series of intrusions blamed on Beijing. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has previously described the Treasury hack reports as 'irrational' and represented 'smear attacks' against China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cyber-watchdog-no-signs-treasury-breach-hit-other-federal-agencies/7926415.html	2025-01-06T13:12:18-08:00	
VOA Turkish: Tensions rise in Syria’s Christian town of Malula after Assad’s fall	Following the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's (HTS) takeover of the government in Syria, everyday life has become tense in Malula, an ancient Christian town in the Damascus countryside, for over a week. The tensions have escalated but stopped short of turning into a clash between Muslims and the majority Christians in the town. Some residents claim that the tensions derive from sectarian differences within the community while others say that the tensions arose from a feud between a Muslim family and a Christian family. Some residents also say that there are concerns over the HTS, which has no clear policy toward groups of different religions and sects, including Christians.

US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military	Washington/New York — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military. The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday. The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the 'Section 1260H list,' designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register. U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was 'clearly a mistake.' It added: 'We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.' CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it 'is not engaged in any military related activities.' A Quectel spokesperson said the company 'does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error.' The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment. Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks. Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was 'reckless' for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations. 'The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,' he said. 'The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions.' Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments. U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility - a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday. While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies. Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations, but remain on the updated list. The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co and China Telecommunications Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijing-s-military/7926307.html	2025-01-06T11:56:46-08:00	
UK’s Starmer slams 'lies and misinformation' after attacks from Elon Musk	LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday condemned 'lies and misinformation' that he said are undermining U.K. democracy, in response to a barrage of attacks on his government from Elon Musk. The billionaire Tesla CEO has taken an intense and erratic interest in British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July. Musk has used his social network, X, to call for a new election and demand Starmer be imprisoned. On Monday he posted an online poll for his 210 million followers on the proposition: 'America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.' Asked about Musk’s comments during a question session at a hospital near London, Starmer criticized 'those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible,' particularly opposition Conservative politicians in Britain who have echoed some of Musk’s claims. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir — shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Recently Musk has focused on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the 'grooming gangs' out of a fear of appearing racist. Musk has posted a demand for a public inquiry into the cases. An inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, though many of the recommendations it made in 2022 have yet to be implemented. Musk also has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England's director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Answering questions after a speech near London, Starmer defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and 'changed the whole prosecution approach' to child sexual exploitation. He also condemned language used by Musk about Jess Phillips, a government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. Musk called Phillips a 'rape genocide apologist' and said she deserved to be in prison. 'When the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,' Starmer said. 'I enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that’s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies.' Musk has also called for the release of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson and is serving a prison sentence for contempt of court. Starmer said people 'cheerleading Tommy Robinson … are trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson promote.' Starmer largely avoided mentioning Musk by name in his responses, likely wary of giving him more of a spotlight — or of angering Musk ally Donald Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as U.S. president on Jan. 20. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, another target of the X owner's ire, has taken a similar approach. Scholz said he is staying 'cool' over critical personal comments made by Musk, but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Starmer said the main issue was not Musk's posts on X, but 'what are politicians here doing to stand up for our democracy?' He said he was concerned about Conservative politicians in Britain 'so desperate for attention they are amplifying what the far right are saying.' 'Once we lose the anchor that truth matters … then we are on a very slippery slope,' he said. While some Conservatives, including party leader Kemi Badenoch, have echoed Musk’s points, the main U.K. beneficiary of his interest has been Reform U.K., the hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has just five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but big expansion plans. Farage said last month that Musk was considering making a multimillion-dollar donation to the party. But Farage is critical of Tommy Robinson, refusing to let him join Reform, and on Sunday Musk posted: 'The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.' Farage tweeted in response: 'Well, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-slams-lies-and-misinformation-after-attacks-from-elon-musk/7926187.html	2025-01-06T10:46:54-08:00	
Grievously wounded Ukrainian soldier gets second chance in US	Just before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, nearly three years ago, 23-year-old Ukrainian army Lieutenant Myroslav Pylypchuk was preparing to become a father. Instead, he found himself confronting the invaders on the frontlines, where he repeatedly faced death, including a face-off with a Russian tank in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. During subsequent fighting in the Kharkiv region, he stepped on a Russian landmine. The explosion cost him his left leg. Just four months later, he was conquering a mountain peak on crutches. Today, he's a father of two young children, living in the U.S. state of Ohio, where he was given a new limb and a new lease on life. In an interview with VOA’s Ukrainian Service, Pylypchuk shared the story of his close encounter with a tank, how a tourniquet from an American benefactor saved his life, and his journey to recovery. ‘This tank is already coming straight at me’ In the spring of 2022, Myroslav Pylypchuk found himself face-to-face with a Russian tank. The duel between the 23-year-old man from the western Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi and the enemy tank was captured on video by a Ukrainian drone operator. 'This tank is already coming straight at me, its gun is rising and aiming at me,' he told VOA. 'I think to myself: either I shoot now, or it shoots first. I take the first shot, the grenade from the grenade launcher ricochets off the ground, flies up over the turret, and explodes. The tank stopped and fired exactly at the spot where I was. But all I got were shrapnel pieces that flew through these bushes and hit me. 'The tank drives into the ditch, turns its turret, and once again targets the spot where I was standing, as if I had really annoyed it, as if I had ruined its day. Then it turns the turret and fires again at the place where I had been. The shell landed where I was, but thank God I had already managed to run about 20 meters away, and the shrapnel from that shell just flew past me.' Just two weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Pylypchuk found out he was going to be a father. On Feb. 24, he packed his things and joined his military unit in Kyiv, where he was then living and stationed. A graduate of the Lviv Academy of Ground Forces, Pylypchuk served in the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region, and ended up commanding a company of 80 soldiers. By May 2022, his unit had taken the village of Tsyrkuny in Kharkiv region back from Russian forces. During just a few months on the front lines, he nearly lost his life three times. 'Shrapnel in one case, a rocket in another, then the tank missed,' he recalled. A gift from an American that saved his life However, Lieutenant Pylypchuk’s luck ran out during the Kharkiv fighting, when he stepped on a landmine. 'I’m walking at one point, I hear an explosion and fall. I try to take a step with my left leg and fall again,' he told VOA. 'I look at my leg — I was wearing new gear, light-colored — and I look at my leg, and it's already completely red.' The blast from the landmine also destroyed two of Pylypchuk’s first aid kits and all his medical supplies. He said it was like he’d been turned into a human sieve — even the scissors for cutting clothing were twisted and scattered in all directions. However, he still had another tourniquet on him — a gift that Ron Jackson, an American volunteer who had been traveling to Ukraine for years to help its military, had given him just before the war started. Jackson’s tourniquet was applied around his chest, saving his life. But the landmine explosion had completely shattered the bone in Pylypchuk’s upper left leg. The medics who treated Pylypchuk at the scene loaded him into the trunk of a Soviet-made Niva SUV for transport to a hospital in Kharkiv. 'The Niva pulls up, and I’m thinking, ‘Where am I supposed to sit?’, because there were two in the car already: one was driving, and the other was covering the window, just in case, God forbid, any sabotage groups showed up. And then they just threw me into the trunk like a sack of potatoes,' he recalled with a smile. With every bump in the road, the adrenaline wore off, and the pain got worse: 'I felt like the donkey from Shrek, asking, ‘How much longer? When is it going to get better?’ They drove me around Kharkiv for about half an hour to forty minutes. I was holding on with every last bit of strength just to stay conscious. As soon as I saw the hospital doors open and that bright light, I closed my eyes. The doctors were shocked that I’d stayed conscious until the very last moment.' Doctors fought for over six hours to save Pylypchuk’s life, and he was unconscious for three days. However, the shrapnel that entered his body had passed through the ground and trees, causing a blood infection — one so serious that his left leg had to be amputated. Recovery in the US Pylypchuk needed a prosthetic for his leg, but the waiting list in Ukraine was long, so he looked for other options. He called Jackson, the American whose tourniquet had saved his life, who introduced Pylypchuk to Ihor, a Ukrainian immigrant who knew a prosthetist in Ohio. Thanks to Ihor, who became Pylypchuk’s sponsor during his move to Ohio, the prosthetic was fitted in the U.S. in October 2022. Pylypchuk also received help through individual donations and free consultations from the prosthetist. In just two weeks — an incredibly fast recovery — he was walking on his own. 'What motivated me was the desire to live, because, well, God didn’t give me a second chance for no reason — He gave me the opportunity to stay alive,' Pylypchuk told VOA. More than two years after stepping on the landmine, Pylypchuk is still undergoing rehabilitation and preparing for additional surgeries. Now living in the U.S. temporarily thanks to Uniting for Ukraine, a special U.S. government parole program for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, he continues to raise funds for and send essential supplies to his fellow soldiers on Ukraine’s front lines. Pylypchuk has a two-year-old son, Mark, and a daughter, Evelina, who was born in the United States. He hopes that by the time he fully recovers, the war in Ukraine will be over and he, his wife and two children can return home. He would like to pursue a career in information technology. For now, he is focusing on his recovery and enjoying fatherhood. 'You only have one life, and you have to live it fully, without being afraid of not doing something. If you want to do something, you need to do it. And appreciate what you have. Above all — your life,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grievously-wounded-ukrainian-soldier-gets-second-chance-in-us/7926170.html	2025-01-06T10:23:28-08:00

US-Somali operation kills 10 al-Shabab militants	WASHINGTON — The Somali government said 10 al-Shabab militants were killed in an operation conducted in collaboration with the United States military. In a statement, Somalia’s information ministry said the operation took place in Beer Xaani town, approximately 60 northwest of Kismayo. The statement was issued on Sunday but did not specify when the operation took place. 'The operation destroyed a group of Khawaarij [deviants] who were planning to launch an attack. No civilians were harmed during the operation' which, according to the statement, was conducted 'with the help of US strikes.' The United States military on Monday confirmed the killing of senior al-Shabab leader Mohamed Mire in an airstrike on Dec. 24 near the town of Kunyo Barrow in Lower Shabelle region. The killing was initially reported by the Somali government two days after the operation. 'Mire, also known as Abu Abdirahman, was responsible for al-Shabaab’s regional governance in Somalia for the last 15 years. In addition to being one of al-Shabaab's longest-serving members, Mire served as the interior minister and played a key role in the group's strategic decision-making,' the United States military command in Africa, AFRICOM said in a statement. AFRICOM said it cannot disclose specifics of the mission, stating only that no civilians were harmed. 'The command will continue to assess the results of the operation and provide additional information as appropriate,' said U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley, AFRICOM commander, according to the statement. 'As our National Security Strategy outlines, America remains steadfast in countering the evolving threats of terrorism,' Langley said. Al-Shabab, which has been fighting the Somali government for more than 15 years, controls large areas in southern Somalia and pockets in the central region of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-somali-operation-kills-10-al-shabab-militants/7926036.html	2025-01-06T08:58:47-08:00	
Pope Francis names 1st woman to head major Vatican office	Rome — Pope Francis on Monday named the first woman to head a major Vatican office, appointing an Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. The appointment marks a major step in Francis’ aim to give women more leadership roles in governing the church. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never has a woman been named prefect of a dicastery or congregation of the Holy See Curia, the central governing organ of the Catholic Church. The historic nature of Brambilla’s appointment was confirmed by Vatican Media, which headlined its report 'Sister Simona Brambilla is the first woman prefect in the Vatican.' The office is one of the most important in the Vatican. Known officially as the Dicastery for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, it is responsible for every religious order, from the Jesuits and Franciscans to smaller newer movements. In an indication of the novelty of the appointment, and the theological implications involved, Francis simultaneously named as a co-leader, or 'pro-prefect,' a cardinal: Ángel Fernández Artime, a Salesian. But the appointment, announced in the Vatican daily bulletin, lists Brambilla first as 'prefect' and Fernández second as her co-leader, which theologically is necessary since the prefect must be able to celebrate Mass and perform other sacramental functions that currently can only be done by men. Brambilla, 59, is a member of the Consolata Missionaries religious order and had served as the No. 2 in the religious orders department since last year. She takes over from the retiring Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz, 77. Francis made Brambilla’s appointment possible with his 2022 reform of the Holy See’s founding constitution, which allowed laypeople, including women, to head a dicastery and become prefects. Brambilla, a nurse, worked as a missionary in Mozambique and led her Consolata order as superior from 2011-2023, when Francis made her secretary of the religious orders department. Her appointment is the latest move by Francis to show by example how women can take leadership roles within the Catholic hierarchy, albeit without allowing them to be ordained as priests. Catholic women do much of the church’s work in schools, hospitals and passing down the faith to future generations. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Among the women holding leadership positions are Sister Raffaella Petrini, the first-ever female secretary general of the Vatican City State, responsible for the territory’s health care system, police force and main source of revenue, the Vatican Museums, which are led by a laywoman, Barbara Jatta. Another nun, Sister Alessandra Smerilli, is the No. 2 in the Vatican development office while several women have been appointed to under-secretary positions, including the French nun, Sister Nathalie Becquart, in the synod of bishops' office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-names-1st-woman-to-head-a-major-vatican-office/7926027.html	2025-01-06T08:55:02-08:00	
US to remove barriers to civil nuclear cooperation with India	New Delhi — The United States is finalizing steps to lift barriers on civil nuclear cooperation with Indian firms, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in New Delhi on Monday, calling it a significant step in cementing the bilateral partnership between the two countries. A landmark deal signed in 2007 between India and the United States had ended three decades of sanctions imposed on New Delhi for conducting nuclear tests and opened the door for India to get civil nuclear technology. The agreement was expected to help India meet its burgeoning energy needs. But Indian rules which require the liability in the case of accidents to be met by the firm that sets up a nuclear power plant rather than the operator — which do not align with global norms — had posed a hurdle to U.S. companies establishing power plants in India. Saying that the 'formal paperwork' to remove long-standing regulations on civil nuclear cooperation will be done soon, Sullivan said that 'this will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restricted list in the United States to come off those lists and enter into deep collaborations with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists.' Sullivan’s visit to India came two weeks before a new administration under incoming President-elect Donald Trump takes charge. Speaking at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, he called India-U.S. collaboration crucial for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the visit underlines the strong Indo-U.S. partnership built in recent years and the likely continuity in those ties amid common concerns over China and strong bipartisan support for the relationship. In an editorial, The Indian Express newspaper noted that an important common thread between Trump’s previous term and President Biden’s administration has been the U.S. policy to strengthen the strategic partnership with India. 'These bilateral conversations during the final days of the transition between two administrations in Washington underline a growing strategic congruence,' the newspaper said. Sullivan said that an initiative launched by the two countries two years ago to bolster their strategic technology partnership was an important component of the relationship. Under the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, both countries are moving to deepen cooperation in areas like quantum computing, defense, artificial intelligence, 5G wireless networks and semiconductors — areas in which China has acquired a dominant position. Pointing out that supply chains are moving out of China, he said that the 'United States, India and other key democratic partners have been reminded abruptly and sharply that we cannot ignore the ways in which interdependencies can be weaponized against us.' 'The visit is basically a signal from the Biden administration that the India-U.S. relationship is important and their cooperation on critical technologies is an important aspect of this relationship,' according to Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'But while the stars are all aligned for New Delhi and Washington, we really don’t know how it will all play out under Trump.' Sullivan met Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval and Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi. In a post on social media platform X, Jaishankar said 'Continued our ongoing discussions on deepening bilateral, regional and global cooperation. Valued the openness of our conversations in the last four years.' New Delhi and Washington have built close ties in recent years despite differences over India’s continuing ties with Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and tensions over the alleged involvement of a former Indian government employee in a foiled plot in 2023 to assassinate a Sikh separatist who is a U.S. national.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-remove-barriers-to-civil-nuclear-cooperation-with-india/7926010.html	2025-01-06T08:41:29-08:00	
Trump's lawyers ask judge to halt Friday's hush money case sentencing while they appeal to block it	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday moved to halt this week's sentencing in his hush money case while he appeals a judge's decision that upheld the historic verdict and put him on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. Trump's lawyers said they will ask a New York appeals court to reverse Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan's ruling last week, which set the case for sentencing on Friday — a little more than a week before his inauguration. Merchan rejected Trump's bid to throw out the May 30 verdict because of his impending return to the White House. Trump's lawyers said they will also appeal a prior decision in which the judge refused to dismiss the case on presidential immunity grounds. In his decision last week, the judge signaled he is not likely to sentence Trump, a Republican, to any punishment for his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump has said that it 'would be the end of the Presidency as we know it' if the ruling is allowed to stand. Trump's lawyers argued Monday that their appeal to the Appellate Division of the state's trial court should trigger what's known as an automatic stay, or pause, in the proceedings. If that doesn't happen, they said, Merchan should step in and halt Friday's sentencing. They asked Merchan to inform them by Monday afternoon of his decision 'to allow sufficient time for President Trump to seek an emergency appellate review.' 'Today, President Trump's legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.'s Witch Hunt,' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said. 'The Supreme Court's historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed.' A message seeking comment was left for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case. Any delay in sentencing Trump could run out the clock on closing the case before his second term begins Jan. 20. As president, he will again be immune from criminal proceedings, making it unlikely he can be sentenced while in office. If sentencing doesn't happen before Trump is sworn in, waiting until he leaves office in 2029 'may become the only viable option,' Merchan said last week. While Trump asserted that presidential immunity and his looming second term necessitated nixing the verdict, Merchan wrote in his Jan. 3 ruling that only 'bringing finality to this matter' by sentencing Trump would serve the interests of justice. The judge wrote that sentencing Trump to what's known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — 'appears to be the most viable solution.' Acknowledging the demands of the transition process, Merchan had given Trump the option to attend in person or appear virtually by video. Whenever he is sentenced, Trump will have an opportunity to speak, as will his lawyers and prosecutors. Once he is sentenced, he can appeal the verdict, as he has vowed to do. The charges involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she'd had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. Cohen, a key prosecution witness who had previously called for Trump to be put in prison, said that 'based upon all of the intervening circumstances' Merchan's decision to sentence Trump without punishment 'is both judicious and appropriate.' Trump's sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense's request. After Trump's Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-lawyers-ask-judge-to-halt-friday-s-hush-money-case-sentencing-while-they-appeal-to-block-it-/7925987.html	2025-01-06T08:29:29-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau expected to announce his political future after facing growing calls to resign	Toronto — Facing growing calls to resign, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to make an announcement about his political future this week. Trudeau — who has become deeply unpopular over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing — has kept publicly mum in recent weeks, despite intensifying pressure for him to step down after the abrupt resignation of his finance minister on Dec. 16. The prime minister has now returned to Ottawa after the Christmas holidays. 'His long silence following this political drama speaks volumes about the weakness of his current position,' said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. While all three opposition parties now say they would support a vote to topple Trudeau's minority government, Parliament is not currently in session so that threat isn't immediate. But members of his own party are increasingly calling for his resignation — making his situation appear more and more untenable. Still, there is no mechanism for Trudeau's party to force him out in the short term. If he hangs on until Parliament returns later this month, his Liberal party could be forced from power by a no-confidence vote that would trigger an election, which would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. The 53-year-old was initially hailed for returning the country to its liberal past when he was elected in 2015, but he has become widely unpopular in recent years. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico. Trudeau is scheduled to participate virtually in a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Canada-U.S. Relations on Monday. If Trudeau does step down as party leader, the Liberals could potentially delay the return of Parliament to give them time to choose a new leader. Because Trudeau's Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh made clear last month the NDP will vote to bring down the government. The other opposition parties have said the same.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-expected-to-announce-his-political-future-after-facing-growing-calls-to-resign/7925894.html	2025-01-06T07:31:11-08:00	
France's former President Sarkozy standing trial over alleged campaign funding by Libya's Gadhafi	Paris — A trial of France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy and 11 co-defendants started Monday over alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, did not speak to the press at arrival. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of embezzlement of public funds and criminal association, punished by up to 10 years in prison. The trial is scheduled to run until April 10. The Libyan case, the biggest and possibly most shocking of several scandals involving Sarkozy, is scheduled to run until April 10, with a verdict expected at a later date. The trial involves 11 other defendants, including three former ministers. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, accused of having played the role of intermediary, has fled in Lebanon and is not expected to appear at the Paris court. Sarkozy is looking forward to the hearings 'with determination,' his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said in a statement. 'There is no Libyan financing of the campaign,' the statement said. 'We want to believe the court will have the courage to examine the facts objectively, without being guided by the nebulous theory that poisoned the investigation.' Gadhafi's alleged agreement The case emerged in March 2011, when a Libyan news agency reported that the Gadhafi government had financed Sarkozy's 2007 campaign. In an interview, Gadhafi himself said 'it's thanks to us that he reached the presidency. We provided him with the funds that allowed him to win,' without providing any amount or other details. Sarkozy, who had welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with great honors in 2007, became one of the first Western leaders to push for a military intervention in Libya in March 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in October that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country. The next year, French online news site Mediapart published a document said to be a note from the Libyan secret services, mentioning Gadhafi's agreement to provide Sarkozy's campaign 50 million euros in financing. Sarkozy strongly rejected the accusations, calling the document a 'blatant fake' and filing complaints for forgery, concealment and spreading false news. However, French investigative magistrates eventually said in 2016 the document has all the characteristics of an authentic one, although there is no definitive evidence that such a transaction took place. The official cost for Sarkozy's 2007 campaign was 20 million euros. Accusations of witness tampering French investigators scrutinized numerous trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy, then the interior minister, between 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff Claude Guéant. They also noted dozens of meetings between Guéant and Takieddine, a key player in major French military contracts abroad. The investigation gained traction when Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered three suitcases from Libya containing millions in cash to the French Interior Ministry. However, Takieddinne reversed his statement four years later. Since then, a separate investigation has been launched into alleged witness tampering as magistrates suspect an attempt to pressure Takieddine in order to clear Sarkozy. Sarkozy and his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were given preliminary charges as financial prosecutors said the former president is suspected of 'benefitting from corruptly influencing' Takieddine. 11 other defendants The other accused are three former French ministers, including Guéant, and a former adviser close to Sarkozy. Like Takieddine, Franco-Algerian businessman Alexandre Djouhri is accused of having been an intermediary. The case also involves Gadhafi's former chief of staff and treasurer Bashir Saleh, who sought refuge in France during the Libyan civil war then moved to South Africa, where he survived a shooting in 2018, before settling in the United Arab Emirates. Other defendants include two Saudi billionaires, a former Airbus executive and a former banker accused of having played a role in the alleged money transfers. Shukri Ghanem, Gadhafi's former oil minister who was also suspected, was found dead in the Danube River in Vienna in 2012 in unclear circumstances. French investigators were able to find Ghanem's notebook, which is believed to document payments made by Libya. Gadhafi's spy chief and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Senoussi told investigative judges millions have indeed been provided to support Sarkozy's campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya. Sarkozy convicted in 2 other cases Sarkozy has been convicted in two other scandals. France's highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was the head of state. He was sentenced to one year in house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry. In February last year, an appeals court in Paris found Sarkozy guilty of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-former-president-sarkozy-standing-trial-over-alleged-campaign-funding-by-libya-s-gadhafi-/7925757.html	2025-01-06T05:49:16-08:00	
Seychelles: Small nation where big powers compete	Victoria, Seychelles — It has been 18 months since the United States reopened its embassy in Victoria, Seychelles, 27 years after Washington left the island nation. Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands strategically located in the Indian Ocean at the confluence of Africa, South Asia and the Gulf states. The small African country is not only attractive to the U.S. for its trade and investment potential but is also a place of importance to U.S. foreign policy, given its 'open sea-lanes, fisheries and the marine environment,' according to the U.S. Embassy. With the U.S. reestablishing a diplomatic presence in the country, it has also become a geopolitical playing field for Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in Africa and the world. During the Cold War, the U.S. had a tracking station in Seychelles to monitor Russian satellites. Several years after the Iron Curtain fell, the U.S. closed the station and its embassy. In Washington’s absence, China filled the void and gained influence in the island nation through construction projects, education initiatives and other soft power ventures. Washington, aware that Beijing had gained a foothold, began reengaging with the country in 2023. Seychelles is one of several island nations the U.S. has deemed strategically important in its attempt to counter China on the global stage. In the Pacific, the U.S. reopened its embassy in the Solomon Islands in 2023 and established an embassy in Tonga. The following year, the U.S. opened an embassy in Vanuatu. While it is yet to be seen what direction the second Trump administration will take globally in its China policy, VOA traveled to the main island of Mahe in Seychelles to look at how China and the U.S. have impacted the country, and how each is fairing in that competition for influence there.

China's Xi: Corruption 'biggest threat' to ruling Communist Party	Beijing — Corruption is the biggest threat to China's Communist Party, President Xi Jinping said on Monday, in a clear warning that the ruling party is resolved to tackle a long-running problem that is now entrenched in many strata of Chinese society. China was rocked last year by corruption probes into high-profile individuals ranging from a deputy central bank governor to a former chairman of its biggest oil and gas company, adding to unease in an economy struggling to secure a firm footing and a society grappling with a fading sense of wealth. The list also included a top Chinese admiral, Miao Hua, whose fall from grace comes at a time when Beijing is trying to modernize its armed forces and boost its battle readiness. Not only is corruption still pervading China, it is actually on the rise, Xi said at the start of a three-day congress of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, CCDI, the country's top anti-graft watchdog. 'Corruption is the biggest threat to our party,' he warned. To underline the scale of the problem, the CCDI said in recent days that a record 58 'tigers,' or senior officials, were probed last year. Of those investigated, 47 were at the vice-ministerial level or above, including Tang Renjian, former minister of agriculture and rural affairs, and Gou Zhongwen, former head of the General Administration of Sport. Even former high-ranking officials were not spared, such as Wang Yilin, who stepped down as chairman of state-owned China National Petroleum Corp in 2020 on reaching retirement age. The crackdown will continue, said Andrew Wedeman, a professor at Georgia State University. 'I don't see how Xi could afford to back off at this point,' Wedeman said. 'A dozen years after he set out to cleanse the senior ranks, Xi is still finding widespread corruption at the top of the party-state and the PLA.' China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has also been swept by a wave of purges since 2023. Li Shangfu was removed as defense minister after seven months and his predecessor Wei Fenghe was expelled from the party for 'serious violations of discipline,' a euphemism for corruption. Challenges Wedeman said it appeared that the pool that Xi is drawing on as replacements also included corrupt officials. 'If Xi is promoting corrupt officials, this suggests the party's internal vetting apparatus is not functioning effectively or, more seriously, is itself corrupted.' China admits its anti-corruption efforts face new challenges, with traditional forms of corruption such as accepting cash becoming more insidious. 'A businessman might offer me money directly, and I'd refuse,' said Fan Yifei, a former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve. 'But if he gives it in the form of stocks or other assets, not directly to me but to my family, that's a whole different matter,' state media quoted Fan as saying. Even the lowly 'flies' and 'ants' in China's vast bureaucracy will not be spared, a program aired on Sunday by the national television broadcaster showed. The first of four episodes of 'Fighting Corruption for the People' that ran ahead of the CCDI meeting focused on grassroots corruption, including a case of how a primary school director profited from kickbacks from on-campus meals and another on how a rural official took bribes from farm project contractors. 'Compared to the 'tigers' far away, the public feels more strongly about the corruption around them,' said Sun Laibin, a professor at Peking University's School of Marxism. The anti-corruption fight must reach the 'hearts' of the masses, he said on the program, so that they can 'deeply feel' the care of the party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-corruption-biggest-threat-to-ruling-communist-party/7925734.html	2025-01-06T05:19:49-08:00	
Nippon, US Steel file suit after Biden administration blocks $15 billion deal	Washington — Japan’s Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel are filing a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process. Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel's aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania's Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval. Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because 'a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure,' he said in a statement. While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to Japan's relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S. president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm. Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks. The president's decision to block the deal comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nippon-us-steel-file-suit-after-biden-administration-blocks-15-billion-deal-/7925729.html	2025-01-06T05:12:17-08:00	
Biden, in 11th hour action, bans new offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters	Washington — President Joe Biden is moving to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, a last-minute effort to block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, said he is using authority under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of Alaska's Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas leasing. 'My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,' Biden said in a statement. 'As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,' he said. Biden's orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico, where most U.S. offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future drilling. Biden's actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind, since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. Trump himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina until 2032. The action came after Trump initially moved to vastly expand offshore drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and other coastal states. Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American 'energy dominance' around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change. Environmental advocates hailed Biden's action, saying new oil and gas drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history. 'This is an epic ocean victory!' said Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana. Gordon thanked Biden 'for listening to the voices from coastal communities' that oppose drilling and 'contributing to the bipartisan tradition of protecting our coasts.' Biden's actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said, adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries. In balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show 'relatively minimal potential' that does not justify possible environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling. A spokeswoman for Trump mocked Biden, saying, 'Joe Biden clearly wants high gas prices to be his legacy.' The spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, called Biden's action 'a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.' Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight against climate change. A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to continue expanding offshore wind development. Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind leases. Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-in-11th-hour-action-bans-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-most-federal-waters-/7925695.html	2025-01-06T04:36:41-08:00	
Blinken expresses confidence in South Korea democratic process	SEOUL — South Korean investigators sought an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed confidence in the key Asian ally's handling of the political turmoil. Investigators probing Yoon over his Dec. 3 martial law proclamation failed to serve an arrest warrant on Friday, blocked by presidential security service guards who formed a human chain to prevent access to Yoon. The arrest warrant, the first for a sitting president, was due to expire at midnight on Monday (1500 GMT). Investigating authorities said in a statement on Monday they had requested an extension of the warrant in court, but declined to say how long the extension will last. Yoon, who has been impeached over his martial law declaration, is also under criminal investigation for possible insurrection. The brief six-hour martial law declaration plunged one of Asia's strongest democracies into uncharted territory with the impeachment of not only Yoon, but also the prime minister who become acting president. Yoon's action drew a rare rebuke from officials in Washington including Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, who has said it was 'badly misjudged.' Speaking after his meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken said Washington had expressed 'serious concerns' to Seoul over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration. But the events unfolding since then have reflected South Korea's brand as a democratic success, 'which is remarkably strong,' Blinken said at a news conference. 'The response that we’ve seen, and that we expect to continue to see, is one that is peaceful and fully consistent and in accordance with the constitution and the rule of law.' Yoon was impeached by parliament on Dec. 14 and suspended from presidential duties. The Constitutional Court is trying the case to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the criminal insurrection probe into Yoon, had sent a notice to police requesting them to take over execution of the arrest warrant. A police official said at a news briefing that police believed there was a legal dispute over such a transfer and would discuss it with the CIO. Yonhap news agency cited a police official as saying the arrest warrant will now be executed under the authority of the police joint investigation team and the CIO. Yoon's lawyers have argued that the CIO anti-graft force has no authority under South Korean law to investigate any case involving insurrection. On Monday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, said the bid to transfer the execution of the arrest warrant is effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were 'illegal.' The unprecedented attempt to arrest an incumbent president has intensified dueling rallies by those supporting Yoon, with the 'Stop the Steal' slogans popularized by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voters, and those calling for Yoon's punishment. On Monday, a group of hardcore Yoon supporters led by Christian pastor Jun Kwang-hoon held a news conference and described the fight for Yoon as an 'international battle' for freedom. 'Sadly, there's no Fox News in Korea,' it said in a statement, referring to the American cable news channel popular with Trump supporters. Jun said Yoon supporters would continue rallies outside his residence until they 'reap the results.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-expresses-confidence-in-south-korea-democratic-process-/7925693.html	2025-01-06T04:22:20-08:00	
Winter blast of snow, ice and bitter cold grips US from Midwest to East Coast	A major winter blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures in the U.S. stirred dangerous travel conditions from central and southern states all the way to the East Coast early Monday, prompting schools and government offices in several states to close. Snow and ice blanketed major roads across Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state’s National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. At least 20 centimeters of snow was expected, along with gusting winds up to 72 kph. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from Kansas and Missouri all the way to New Jersey. 'For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,' the weather service said. Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at thick ice coating his SUV in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri. Wright said he will work remotely Monday, but wanted to scrape off his vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He also is seeking boots for their two older dogs that 'won’t budge at all' when their paws hit the cold ground. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and plunges southward. Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip. Classes canceled School closings are expected to be widespread Monday. Districts in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky began announcing cancellations and delays on Sunday afternoon. Kentucky’s Jefferson County Public Schools canceled classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for its nearly 100,000 students. Classes also have been cancelled in Maryland, where Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced the state government would be closed Monday. 'Keeping Marylanders safe is our top priority. Please stay off the roads during this storm. Prepare your home and family and charge your communications devices in case you lose power,' Moore said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-blast-of-snow-ice-and-bitter-cold-grips-us-from-midwest-to-east-coast-/7925660.html	2025-01-06T03:40:01-08:00	
Uganda's military leader says he wants to behead opposition leader	NAIROBI, KENYA — The head of Uganda's military, who is also the son of longstanding President Yoweri Museveni, said he wanted to behead the country's most prominent opposition leader. Muhoozi Kainerugaba is widely believed to be the heir apparent to his father, who has governed Uganda since 1986. Kainerugaba routinely makes inflammatory posts on social media, including a threat in 2022 to invade neighboring Kenya. Kainerugaba later apologized for that threat. He sometimes says that certain posts are meant ironically. In a post on X on Sunday evening, Kainerugaba said his father, whom he referred to by the honorific Mzee, was the only person protecting opposition leader Bobi Wine from him. 'If Mzee was not there, I would cut off his head today,' Kainerugaba posted. Bobi Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi and who finished second to Museveni in the 2021 presidential election, responded on X that he did not take the threat lightly, saying there had been several previous attempts on his life. Kainerugaba responded: 'Finally! I woke you up? Before I behead you, repay us the money we loaned you,' suggesting the government had previously bought off Wine to undermine the opposition. Spokespeople for the government and Kainerugaba were not immediately reachable for comment. A spokesperson for the armed forces declined to comment. The government spokesperson has previously said Kainerugaba's social media posts should be understood as 'casual' comments and not taken seriously or as reflecting government policy. Wine, a popular musician turned politician has parlayed his star power into a career as Museveni's most formidable challenger. He rejected the results of the 2021 election, alleging ballot stuffing and intimidation. Human rights activists have also accused Museveni's government of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detention. Uganda's government has repeatedly denied allegations of election fraud and human rights abuses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-military-leader-says-he-wants-to-behead-opposition-leader/7925642.html	2025-01-06T02:59:53-08:00	
China's top diplomat heads to Africa as West's attention dwindles	BEIJING — China's top diplomat began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Sunday, maintaining a 35-year-long tradition, to quietly advance Beijing's already sizeable influence across the resource-rich continent as Europe's presence wanes and America's wavers. While global capitals and investors brace for the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to the White House, and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and domestic politics keep German and French ministers occupied, Foreign Minister Wang Yi being in Namibia, the Republic of Congo, Chad and Nigeria highlights the consistency of China's engagement with Africa, analysts say. Wang's visit through to Saturday also comes as the world's No.2 economy ramps up its financial support for the debt-laden continent and looks to strike more critical minerals deals and find markets to absorb its exports. 'The decision on which countries to go to each year rarely follows any external logic,' said Eric Orlander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project. '(But) it resonates in Africa as a reminder of China's consistent commitment to the continent, in contrast to the approaches of the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union.' 'China firmly believes that Africa has never been a forgotten continent, but rather a source of vitality and a land full of development potential,' Guo Jiakun, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular news conference on Monday. As China's economy slows, Africa offers a much-needed avenue for its state-owned infrastructure firms struggling for projects as indebted local governments hold off on spending, and a market for its electric vehicles and solar panels, areas where the U.S. and EU say it has over-capacity. Africa's 50-plus votes at the United Nations could also help advance Beijing's efforts to reshape multilateral institutions and reinterpret global norms so that they are more in line with its interests, particularly on issues such as human rights. While current U.S. President Joe Biden's December trip to Angola was his only visit to sub-Saharan Africa in his presidency, China puts Africa at the front of its diplomatic calendar. 'China has become central to Africa's policy, as an actor and an inspiration,' said Hannah Ryder, founder of Development Reimagined, an African-owned consultancy, referring to how candidates vying to chair the African Union Commission have talked up Beijing's ability to improve Africa's manufacturing capabilities and China's track record in mass education ahead of February's election. The commission is the secretariat of the 55-nation African Union. Security issues Wang's decision to visit the Republic of Congo, which this year takes over as co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) that sets the agenda for China-Africa relations, also points to China's commitment to implementing the outcomes of last year's summit, Ryder said, where China pledged $51 billion in fresh financial assistance. Beijing is also beginning to make its presence felt on pressing regional security issues, analysts say, which partly explains why Wang will travel to Chad. France last month began the withdrawal of its military from the Central African country, after its government unexpectedly ended a defense cooperation pact that had made it a key Western ally in the fight against Islamic militants in the region. 'China has been a reliable and stable partner for the new military juntas in the Sahel and West Africa,' Orland said. 'For the French and U.S., who see a dilution of Western power in the region, China's presence is seen as 'controversial,' but it's a very different view from African perspectives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-top-diplomat-heads-to-africa-as-west-s-attention-dwindles/7925632.html	2025-01-06T02:42:01-08:00	
Israeli officials say bus shooting kills 3 in West Bank	Gunmen attacked a bus and car Monday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing at least three people and wounding seven others, Israeli emergency services said. The attack happened near the Palestinian town of Al-Funduq. Israel’s military said its forces were pursuing the attackers and using blockades to cordon off villages in the area. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences for the victims and vowed to find those responsible. 'No one will get away,' Netanyahu said on X. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. Gaza ceasefire U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday the United States wants to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in two weeks. But Blinken said if there is no deal by then, he is 'confident that it will get its completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later.' The United States, Egypt and Qatar have worked for months to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas, but the warring sides have not come close enough in their terms to reach an agreement. Basic parameters of a proposed deal include a halt in fighting in Gaza, an increase in humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages still being held by Hamas militants. The war began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Philippines deploys maritime and air assets to monitor China's 'monster ship'	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines has deployed air and sea assets of its military and coast guard in its exclusive economic zone to monitor China's largest coast guard vessel, calling the ship's presence an act of Chinese 'intimidation, coercion and aggression.' According to the Philippine coast guard, the 165 m long vessel 5901, referred to by the Philippines as 'the monster,' was on Sunday 65 to 70 nautical miles off the coast of the province of Zambales. 'We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. The moment it (carries out) any provocative action, it will be met with appropriate response,' Jonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the National Security Council, told state television on Monday. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ties between China and U.S. ally the Philippines have soured in the past few years, with spats frequent as Manila, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, pushes back at what it sees as aggression by Beijing. China has accused the Philippines of repeated encroachment in its waters. China claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory, with a massive coast guard presence in and around the EEZs of neighbors Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. Beijing rejects a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that said those expansive maritime claims had no legal basis. According to video shared by the Philippine coast guard, it ordered the Chinese vessel to leave the area, warning it has no authority to operate there. In its radioed response, the Chinese ship said it was conducting law enforcement duties within its jurisdictional waters. 'This is part of China's intimidation, coercion, aggression and deception. They are showcasing their ship to intimidate our fishermen,' Malaya said, adding the Philippine maritime presence would be boosted to support fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-deploys-maritime-and-air-assets-to-monitor-china-s-monster-ship-/7925622.html	2025-01-06T02:23:27-08:00	
Malaysia's jailed ex-leader Najib wins appeal to pursue bid to serve corruption sentence at home	PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia — Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest. In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest. Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on Jan. 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later. The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case. The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order. 'We are happy that finally Najib has got a win,' his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. 'He is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognized some element of injustice that has been placed against him.' The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read. He said it was 'criminal' for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case. In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan's order 'in bad faith.' Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib's hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on Jan. 30 last year under Malaysia's unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib's application have not made any public comments. Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on Aug. 23, 2028. He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The pardons board didn't give any reason for its decision and wasn't required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners. Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009. Investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib's associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewelry. More than $700 million landed in Najib's bank accounts. Najib is still fighting graft charges in the main trial linking him directly to the scandal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-jailed-ex-leader-najib-wins-appeal-to-pursue-bid-to-serve-corruption-sentence-at-home/7925619.html	2025-01-06T02:13:49-08:00	
South Korea says North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea on Monday fired a ballistic missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, South Korea's military said, extending its weapons testing weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the midrange missile was fired from an area near the North Korean capital Pyongyang and that the launch preparations were detected in advance by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. It denounced the launch as a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The joint chiefs said the military was strengthening its surveillance and defense posture in preparation for possible additional launches. Japan's Defense Ministry said the missile landed outside its exclusive economic zone and that there were no reports of damage to vessels or aircraft. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed concern that the North's accelerated pace in missile tests is advancing its capabilities. The North last year tested various nuclear-capable systems that threaten its neighbors and the United States, including a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile that achieved both the highest altitude and longest flight time of any missile the country has launched. Blinken holds talks in Seoul as political turmoil shakes South Korea The launch came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. Blinken's visit comes amid political turmoil in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law decree and subsequent impeachment by parliament last month, which experts say puts the country at a disadvantage in getting a steady footing with Trump ahead of his return to the White House. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken condemned North Korea's latest launch, which violates U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by leader Kim Jong Un's nuclear-armed military. Blinken described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' Blinken and Cho both dismissed concerns about damage to the U.S.-South Korea alliance in the aftermath of the political turmoil in Seoul. Experts had warned that Yoon's martial law decree — which lasted only hours but has rattled politics, high-level diplomacy and financial markets for weeks — exposed the fragility of South Korea's democratic system in a divided society. 'We had serious concerns about some of the actions that President Yoon took and we communicated those directly to the government,' Blinken said. 'At the same time we have tremendous confidence in the resilience of South Korea's democracy, in the strength of its institutions and in the efforts that it's making to work through those institutions, pursuant to the constitution and the rule of law to resolve differences and to do so peacefully.' Kim's warning ahead of Trump's return In a year-end political conference, Kim, the North Korean leader, vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say. It's unclear whether Trump would be as active as Biden in strengthening U.S. alliances in Asia. During his first term, Trump complained about the cost of keeping 28,000 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter North Korean threats and constantly pushed for significant increases in Seoul's defense contributions. There are also concerns in Seoul that Trump's 'America first' approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-north-korea-fired-a-ballistic-missile-into-the-sea-/7925611.html	2025-01-06T01:44:51-08:00	
Jimmy Carter raised climate change concerns 35 years before the Paris Accords	PLAINS, GEORGIA — When Jimmy Carter chose branding designs for his presidential campaign, he passed on the usual red, white and blue. He wanted green. Emphasizing how much the Georgia Democrat enjoyed nature and prioritized environmental policy, the color became ubiquitous. On buttons, bumper stickers, brochures, the sign rechristening the old Plains train depot as his campaign headquarters. Even the hometown Election Night party. 'The minute it was announced, we all had the shirts to put on — and they were green, too,' said LeAnne Smith, Carter’s niece, recalling the 1976 victory celebration. Nearly a half-century later, environmental advocates are remembering Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, as a president who elevated environmental stewardship, energy conservation and discussions about the global threat of rising carbon dioxide levels. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to abandon the renewable energy investments that President Joe Biden included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, echoing how President Ronald Reagan dismantled the solar panels Carter installed on the White House roof. But politics aside, the scientific consensus has settled where Carter stood two generations earlier. 'President Carter was four decades ahead of his time,' said Manish Bapna, who leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carter called for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions well before 'climate change' was part of the American lexicon, he said. Wearing cardigans and setting standards Former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate advocacy earned him the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, called Carter 'a lifelong role model for the entire environmental movement.' As president, Carter implemented the first U.S. efficiency standards for passenger vehicles and household appliances. He created the U.S. Department of Energy, which streamlined energy research, and more than doubled the wilderness area under National Park Service protection. Inviting ridicule, Carter asked Americans to conserve energy through personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down thermostats in winter amid global fuel shortages. He pushed renewable energy to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, calling for 20% of U.S. energy to come from alternative sources by 2000. But laments linger about what 39th president could not get done or did not try before his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan. Addressing climate change Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a West Wing report linking fossil fuels to rising carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s atmosphere. Carter’s top environmental advisers urged 'immediate' cutbacks on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce what scientists at the time called 'carbon dioxide pollution.' 'Nobody anywhere in the world in a high government position was talking about this problem' before Carter, biographer Jonathan Alter said. The White House released the findings, which drew forgettable news coverage: The New York Times published its story on the 13th page of its front section. And with scant time left in office, there were no tangible moves Carter could make, beyond the energy legislation he had already signed. The report recommended limiting global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Thirty-five years later, in the 2015 Paris climate accords, participating nations set a similar goal. 'If he had been reelected, it’s fair to say that we would have been beginning to address climate change in the early 1980s,' Alter told the AP. 'When you think about that, it adds a kind of a tragic dimension, almost, to his political defeat.' Reagan ended high-level conversations about carbon emissions. He opposed efficiency standards as government overreach and rolled back some regulations. His chief of staff, Don Regan, called the solar panels 'a joke.' Pursuing energy independence Despite Carter’s emphasis on renewable sources, the fossil fuel industry benefited from his push toward U.S. energy independence. Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Foundation, pointed to coal-fired power plants built during and shortly thereafter Carter’s term, and his deregulation of natural gas production, a move O'Mara called 'a precursor' to widespread fracking. Bapna noted Carter backed drilling off the coasts of Long Island in New York and New England. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, pointed to Carter’s Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a short-lived effort to produce fossil fuel alternatives that 'would have meant much higher carbon emissions.' But Carter had the right priorities, especially on research and development coordinated through the Energy Department, Nadel said. 'He allowed us to have a national approach rather than one agency here and another there.' Stewarding God's creation Carter’s environmental interests had deep roots going back to a a rural boyhood filled with hunting and fishing and working his father’s farmland. 'Jimmy Carter was an environmentalist before it was a real part of the political discussion — and I’m not talking about solar panels on the White House,' said Dubose Porter, a longtime Georgia Democratic Party leader. 'Just focusing on that, misses how early and how committed he was.' His early years as a youth, influenced Carter as governor, Porter said, when he boosted Georgia's state parks system and opposed Georgia congressmen who wanted to dam a river. Carter paddled the waterway himself and decided its natural state trumped the lucrative federal construction proposal. In Washington, Carter continued sometimes unwinnable fights against funding for projects he deemed damaging and unnecessary. He found more success extending federal protection for more than 60.7 million hectares, including redwood forests in California and vast swaths of Alaska. Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College professor who has written on Carter's faith, said he saw himself as a custodian of divinely granted natural resources. 'That’s a real connection that young evangelicals still have with him today,' Balmer said. Condemning consumerism Carter won the presidency amid energy shortages rooted in global strife, especially in the oil-rich Middle East, so national security and economic interests dovetailed with Carter’s religious beliefs and affinity for nature, Nadel noted. Carter compared the energy crisis to 'the moral equivalent of war,' and as inflation and gas lines grew, he called for individual sacrifice and sweeping action on renewable energy. 'Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns,' Carter warned in 1979. 'But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.' That 'malaise' speech — dubbed so by the media despite Carter not using the word — was unique in presidential politics for its condemnation of unchecked American consumerism. Carter celebrated that more than 100 million Americans watched. By 2010, Carter acknowledged in his annotated 'White House Diary' that his speech was a flop, but said it proved to be prescient for advocating bold and direct action on energy. 'You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today,' said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 2020 presidential run focused on climate action. 'I’ve learned in politics that timing is everything and serendipity is everything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-raised-climate-change-concerns-35-years-before-the-paris-accords-/7925609.html	2025-01-06T01:40:36-08:00	
Afghans arrive in the Philippines to complete visa processing for resettlement in US	MANILA, Philippines — A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the Philippines on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between Manila and Washington. The Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring to resettle in America. Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival. The U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals' stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security, medical and transportation expenses, she said. She didn't specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa processing will take. Under the Philippines' rules, visa applicants can stay for no longer than 59 days. A senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines under the 'one-time' deal. The official who had knowledge of the negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly. The Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in 2021. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said. Marcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year, he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014 defense agreement in a decision that upset China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghans-arrive-in-the-philippines-to-complete-visa-processing-for-resettlement-in-us/7925603.html	2025-01-06T01:28:15-08:00	
Taiwan says cyberattacks double in 2024, China main culprit	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Chinese hackers were involved in most of the cyberattacks against Taiwan last year, which doubled to a daily average of 2.4 million, Taiwanese security officials said. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and for years has been ramping up military, diplomatic and political pressure on the island to accept its claims of sovereignty. Taiwan says cyberattacks have also increased as Beijing uses a range of 'grayzone' methods to harass the islan— tactics that fall short of an act of war. Most of the daily attacks received by Taiwan's Government Service Network were attributed to China's 'cyber force,' the National Security Bureau said in a report on Sunday. Defense, telecommunications and transport were among the top targets, with many of the cyberattacks 'effectively detected and blocked,' it said. 'The growing numbers of attacks pinpoint the increasingly severe nature of China's hacking activities,' the report said. 'Its techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and covered a wide range of targets, such as government agencies, critical infrastructure and high-tech manufacturing industry.' Chinese hackers carried out Distributed Denial of Service attacks on Taiwan's transport and financial sectors when Beijing held military drills near the island, 'intending to intensify the harassment effect and military intimidation,' the bureau said. Several countries, notably the United States, have voiced alarm in recent years at what they say is hacking activity backed by Beijing targeting their governments, militaries and businesses. China has denied the allegations, previously insisting it opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks. Beijing last week rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the U.S. Treasury Department, calling the claims 'groundless.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-cyberattacks-double-in-2024-china-main-culprit/7925596.html	2025-01-06T01:07:26-08:00	
Blinken: China, North Korea helping drive Russia’s war in Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that North Korea and China are the 'biggest ongoing drivers' allowing Russia to carry out its war in Ukraine, and that security assurances will need to be a part of potential future negotiations ending the conflict. Speaking during a visit to South Korea, Blinken said North Korean supplies of artillery, ammunition and troops, along with Chinese support for Russia’s military industrial base are giving the Russian military the backing it needs to continue carrying out the fight it started in February 2022. He said North Korea is already seeing a return on its involvement in the conflict in the form of Russian military equipment and training for North Korea troops. 'We believe it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK,' Blinken said. With only two weeks left in the Biden administration, the United States has been rushing to send remaining authorized aid to Ukraine amid uncertainty about how President-elect Donald Trump may approach the war. Blinken said Monday the U.S. has been trying to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself, and to have the 'strongest possible hand' at a future negotiating table with Russia. 'If there is going to be, at some point, a ceasefire, it's not going to be, in Putin's mind, 'game over',' Blinken said. 'His imperial ambitions remain, and what he will seek to do is to rest, to refit, and eventually to re-attack.' Blinken said it is necessary to have an 'adequate deterrent in place so that he doesn't do that, so that he thinks twice – three times – before engaging in any re-aggression.' Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 79 of the 128 drones that Russian forces deployed overnight in attack targeting multiple Ukrainian regions. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Cherkasy reported damage to residential buildings and a grain warehouse from falling drone debris. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 12 Ukrainian aerial drones, all in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attacks injured three people and damaged several residential buildings.

US Congress to certify Trump’s election win	The U.S. Congress is set to meet Monday to certify Donald Trump’s presidential election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. The vice president is in charge of presiding over the count of results from each of the country’s 50 states, putting Harris in the position of certifying her own loss. The procedure was long a formality in the election process, but four years ago turned to chaos as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, injuring about 140 police officers, vandalizing the building and sending lawmakers rushing for safety. Similar scenes are not expected Monday, with Harris having conceded defeat and President Joe Biden highlighting the need for a peaceful process. Authorities have prepared just in case, erecting tall metal barriers around the Capitol complex. Speaking Sunday at the White House, Biden called what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 'one of the toughest days in American history.' 'We’ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,' Biden said. He added that Trump’s conduct four years ago, which included repeated false claims that he won the election, 'was a genuine threat to democracy.' 'I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now,' Biden said. More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with storming the Capitol. Trump has pledged to quickly issue pardons after he takes office on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-to-certify-trump-s-election-win/7925572.html	2025-01-05T23:33:14-08:00

South Korean anti-corruption agency seeks police help in arresting impeached president	South Korea’s anti-corruption agency is seeking an extension of the arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, and for police to assist in so-far unsuccessful efforts to arrest Yoon. The warrant approved by a court last week to arrest Yoon was set to expire Monday afternoon. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials wants to question Yoon in response to the martial law decree he issued Dec. 3, which set off a political crisis in the country and quickly led to his impeachment. Investigators tried to execute the warrant last week, but hundreds of security forces blocked access to Yoon’s residence. The failure prompted the anti-corruption agency to try to enlist the help of the police to execute the warrant and arrest Yoon. Yoon’s lawyers have rejected the authority of the anti-corruption agency and called the arrest warrant unlawful. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-anti-corruption-agency-seeks-police-help-in-arresting-impeached-president/7925541.html	2025-01-05T21:52:13-08:00	
The Brutalist,' 'Emilia Perez' triumph at Golden Globes	Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet's 215-minute postwar epic 'The Brutalist' and Jacques Audiard's Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical 'Emilia Perez' — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday. The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to be unlike anything else. 'The Brutalist' was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. 'I was told that this film was un-distributable,' said Corbet. 'No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works.' 'Emilia Perez' won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song ('El Mal') and best non-English language film. Karla Sofia Gascon, the film's transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, spoke for the film. 'The light always wins over darkness,' said Gascon, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. 'You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.' 'I am who I am. Not who you want.' The night's big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker was Moore's win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in 'The Substance,' about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of 'Anora.' 'I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,' said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for 'Ghost.' 'Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress.' Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in 'I’m Still Here,' a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro. Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for another movie about physical transformation: 'A Different Man,' in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who's healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice,' noted that both films were hard to get made. 'These are tough subject matters but these films are real and they're necessary,' said Stan. 'But we can't be afraid and look away.' Glaser lightly roasts the Globes Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: 'I'm not here to roast you.' But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand. While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year's Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted. Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years. Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of Hollywood stars. 'You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for,' said Glaser. 'But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time ... if there is one. I’m scared.' The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded. A win for ‘Wicked’ The Globes' award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chu's 'Wicked,' which has nearly collected $700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, 'Wicked' is easily the biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the award, Chu argued for 'a radical act of optimism' in art. Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging as the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s 'A Real Pain,' his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series 'Succession.' He called the Globes 'basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have,' and then thanked her for 'putting up what you call my mania.' The papal thriller 'Conclave' took best screenplay, for Peter Straughan's script. 'Flow,' the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like 'Inside Out 2' and 'The Wild Robot.' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for 'Challengers.' TV prizes Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ 'Shogun.' It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: 'Hacks' (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), 'The Bear' (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and 'Baby Reindeer' (best limited series). Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for 'True Detective' and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in 'The Penguin.' 'I guess it's prosthetics from here on out,' said Farrell.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-brutalist-emilia-perez-triumph-at-golden-globes/7925538.html	2025-01-05T21:45:44-08:00

Sunday school class with Jimmy Carter: What it was like	Plains, Georgia — It never got old. No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter. This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn't building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases. For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world. Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land. Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services). Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome. Sundays with Mr. Jimmy Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan — Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant. It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer's orderly mind. Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters — and nearly everyone did — you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon. If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief 'good morning' or 'thank you.' Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors — that always got a laugh — and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I'm sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries. If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. 'I used to live there,' the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin. Carter's Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he'd been up to or his perspective on world affairs. Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center's successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. 'Willie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House,' Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson's affection for weed. 'I don't know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I've heard rumors,' the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word. My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research. Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore. I recall the punchline. 'How do I look up things now?' asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: 'Google.' Memories of visits During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging. He resisted church members' pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018. 'I'm uncomfortable sitting down,' he said, 'but I guess I'll get used to it.' Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class. Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard — voilà — a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back. If there wasn't enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter's lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room. A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits. Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn't happen in front of the big crowd. After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey's house, which included one glass each of 'bargain-brand Chardonnay,' I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he'd had the night before. 'I'll say one,' Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers. No matter where you sat — main sanctuary or back room — everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward. When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands. 'I'll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,' he quipped after one of his final lessons. 'Actually, since I'm in church, I better say I'll be willing to have photographs made with all of you.' For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are. The final lesson Turnout for Carter's Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before. Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation. But Mr. Jimmy wasn't done just yet. The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter's lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect. 'I'm going to start by asking you a very profound question,' he said. 'How many of you believe in life after death?' Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready. 'We don't have anything to dread after death,' Carter said with a reassuring smile. At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. 'I'm going to hold you to it,' Carter promised. He never got the chance. His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy's treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sunday-school-class-with-jimmy-carter-what-it-was-like/7925467.html	2025-01-05T16:54:01-08:00	
TikTok creators in US left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential platform ban	Will TikTok in the U.S. be banned this month? That's the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban. At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not. For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter. If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures. 'A lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,' said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok's live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films 'Gambit' and 'Awaken! My Neighbor.' Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is 'hard to accept.' Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they've invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content. For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down. 'I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,' said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands. It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional. Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban 'sweeping and troubling' and said he wants a 'negotiated resolution' to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail. While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content. Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn't found a place quite like TikTok, she's begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027. Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups. Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens. 'I'm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,' said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth. A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he'd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom. 'For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,' Hurst said. Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency's founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus, it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said. But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences. If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app 'unworkable,' the Justice Department has said. TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-creators-in-us-left-in-limbo-while-awaiting-decision-on-potential-platform-ban/7925460.html	2025-01-05T16:45:26-08:00	
Heavy snow brings widespread disruptions across UK, Germany	London — Heavy snow and freezing rain brought widespread disruptions across Europe on Sunday, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, with several major airports forced to suspend flights. With the weather set to stay inclement on Sunday in the U.K., there are concerns that many rural communities, particularly in the north of England, could be cut off, with up to 40 centimeters (15 inches) of snow on the ground above 300 meters (985 feet). The National Grid, which oversees the country's electricity network, said it had been working to restore power after outages across the country. Power cuts were reported in the English cities of Birmingham and Bristol, and Cardiff, Wales. Many sporting events have already been postponed, though the heavyweight Premier League fixture between rivals Liverpool and Manchester United is on, following an inspection at Liverpool's Anfield stadium and of local conditions. Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport had to close runways overnight, but operations were returning back to normal Sunday. Leeds Bradford Airport took longer to get flights back in the air. The road network was heavily impacted too on what would have been a very busy day with many families returning home from the Christmas and New Year's break, and students heading back to universities. Many roads had been preemptively closed by local authorities, but stranded vehicles and collisions have caused disruption elsewhere. Several U.K. train services were canceled, with National Rail warning of disruptions continuing into the workweek. Britain's main weather forecaster, the Met Office, says sleet and snow will continue to push north Sunday and will be heaviest in northern England and into southern Scotland. After experiencing freezing rain, which occurs when super-cold rain freezes on impact, the south will turn milder. The Environment Agency has also issued eight flood warnings across southern England on the Taw and Avon rivers. Snow and ice were also causing havoc in Germany, where a bout of wintry weather is spreading from the southwest. Authorities have issued black ice warnings for drivers and pedestrians, advising people to stay home where possible. Frankfurt airport canceled 120 of its 1,090 planned takeoffs and landings Sunday, according to the Fraport press office. At Munich airport, only one runway was open while the other one was being cleared. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, eight people were injured when a bus skidded off the road near the town of Hemmingen. Long-distance train connections also experienced irregularities in the Frankfurt area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-brings-widespread-disruptions-across-uk-germany/7925447.html	2025-01-05T16:12:58-08:00	
Nun from Brazil tops list of world's oldest living person at nearly 117	A soccer-loving nun from Brazil is believed to have become the world's oldest living person at nearly 117 following the recent death of a woman from Japan. Sister Inah Canabarro was so skinny growing up that many didn't think she would survive childhood, Cleber Canabarro, her 84-year-old nephew, told The Associated Press. LongeviQuest, an organization that tracks supercentenarians around the globe, released a statement on Saturday declaring the wheelchair-bound nun the world's oldest person validated by early life records. In a video shot by the organization last February, the smiling Canabarro can be seen cracking jokes, sharing miniature paintings she used to make of wildflowers and reciting the Hail Mary prayer. The secret to longevity? Her Catholic faith, she says. 'I'm young, pretty and friendly — all very good, positive qualities that you have too,' the Teresian nun tells the visitors to her retirement home in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. Her nephew spends time with her every Saturday and sends her voice messages between visits to keep her spirits up following two hospitalizations that left her weak, with difficulty talking. 'The other sisters say she gets a jolt when she hears my voice,' he says. 'She gets excited.' Canabarro was born on June 8, 1908, to a large family in southern Brazil, according to LongeviQuest researchers. But her nephew said her birth was registered two weeks late and she was actually born on May 27. Her great-grandfather was a famed Brazilian general who took up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century. She took up religious work still a teenager and spent two years in Montevideo, Uruguay, before moving to Rio de Janeiro and eventually settling in her home state of Rio Grande do Sul. A lifelong teacher, among her former students was Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the last of the military dictators who governed Brazil between 1964 and 1985. She was also the beloved creator of two marching bands at schools in sister cities straddling the border between Uruguay and Brazil. For her 110th birthday, she was honored by Pope Francis. She is the second oldest nun ever documented, after Lucile Randon, who was the world's oldest person until her death in 2023 at the age of 118. Local soccer club Inter — which was founded after Canabarro's birth — celebrates every year the birthday of its oldest fan. Her room is decorated with gifts in the team's red and white colors, says her nephew. 'White or black, rich or poor, whoever you are, Inter is the team of the people,' she says in one video posted on social media celebrating her 116th birthday with the club's president. Canabarro took the title of the oldest living person following the death of Japan's Tomiko Itooka in December, according to LongeviQuest. She now ranks as the 20th oldest documented person to have ever lived, a list topped by Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, according to LongeviQuest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nun-from-brazil-tops-list-of-world-s-oldest-living-person-at-nearly-117/7925444.html	2025-01-05T16:02:42-08:00	
Central US pummeled by snow, ice as major storm heads east	Washington — Dangerous wintry conditions descended Sunday on a large swath of the central United States as a severe storm system tracked eastward, prompting travel and work disruptions from Kansas City to Washington. Around a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey were under winter storm warnings Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), while areas across the U.S. South faced possible tornado and cold weather threats. Nationwide, over 60 million people were under some sort of weather alert, according to broadcaster CNN, while air traffic monitoring site FlightAware showed almost 2,200 flight cancellations and over 25,000 delays. Gusty winds from the storm system, the first of the year, brought blizzard conditions to Kansas and Missouri, while states farther east were blanketed in multiple inches of snow. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear implored residents to 'please stay home' after reporting multiple vehicle crashes had closed a major highway. The NWS also warned that accumulations of up to a half inch of ice in some areas — as well as widespread tree damage from powerful wind gusts — could lead to 'prolonged power outages.' A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow began hitting Kansas early Sunday morning. Storm chaser Brian Emfinger said on X that roads around Kansas City were 'a skating rink.' Video posted by the Weather Channel showed cars skidding off ice-coated highways and tractor trailers jack-knifing in Kansas, where some areas were expecting more than 30 centimeters of snow. 'Areas of heavy snow will spread eastward through the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians tonight, reaching the northern Mid-Atlantic by Monday morning,' the NWS said in an update. Areas around Washington could see up to 25 centimeters overnight from Sunday into Monday, making 'hazardous travel and closings' likely, The Washington Post reported. That could complicate the task of U.S. lawmakers, who by constitutional mandate must meet on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to certify the winner of last year's presidential election. 'Whether we're in a blizzard or not,' House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Fox News Sunday, 'we cannot delay that certification... I hope we have full attendance.' A joint session is to convene at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Monday. Bitter cold With the jet stream diving southward, temperatures are expected to plunge, in some places to minus 18 degrees Celsius, while strong wind gusts compound the dangers. The mercury could sink tens of degrees below seasonal norms down to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Before then, severe thunderstorms are expected across the lower Mississippi Valley, the NWS forecast. Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet. A thick coating of ice could make travel hazardous, bring down trees and topple electricity lines. The NWS predicted more than 1 centimeter of freezing rain over parts of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley area, and warned that 'long-lasting power outages' could leave millions of customers without power from Kansas to the central Appalachian Mountains. Conditions could prove especially perilous in Appalachia, where a deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged multiple southeastern states including Kentucky. The new storm 'will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just 24 hours or so before it's going to get really cold in Kentucky,' Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting. The governors of Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia have declared a state of emergency in their states, and have taken to social media to warn residents to stay home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-us-pummeled-by-snow-ice-as-major-storm-heads-east/7925209.html	2025-01-05T15:50:59-08:00	
Israel helps ex-soldier leave Brazil over probe of alleged war crimes in Gaza	Jerusalem — Israel has helped a former soldier leave Brazil after legal action was initiated against him by a group accusing Israelis of war crimes in the Gaza Strip based in part on soldiers' social media posts. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Sunday it had helped the former soldier safely leave Brazil on a commercial flight after what it described as 'anti-Israel elements' who sought an investigation last week. It warned Israelis against posting on social media about their military service. The Hind Rajab Foundation, named for a 5-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza, said Brazilian authorities had launched an investigation into the soldier after it filed a complaint based on video footage, geolocation data and photographs showing him taking part in the demolition of civilian homes. The foundation described the move as a 'pivotal step toward accountability for crimes committed in Gaza' during nearly 15 months of war. There was no immediate comment from Brazilian authorities. Brazilian media reported Saturday that the investigation was ordered by an on-call federal judge in Brazil’s Federal District. The decision was issued on Dec. 30 but first reported over the weekend. Israel has faced heavy international criticism over its war against Hamas in Gaza, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. The International Court of Justice is separately investigating genocide allegations. The Brazil case raised the prospect that rank-and-file Israeli troops could also face prosecution while abroad. Israel rejects the international allegations, saying its forces in Gaza are acting in accordance with international law and that any violations are punished within its judicial systems. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying the militant group conceals tunnels and other infrastructure in residential buildings, necessitating their demolition. Throughout the war, Israeli soldiers have posted numerous videos from Gaza that appear to show them rummaging through homes and blowing up or burning residential buildings. In some, they chant racist slogans or boast about destroying the Palestinian territory. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up over half the dead but do not distinguish between civilians and militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-helps-ex-soldier-leave-brazil-over-probe-of-alleged-war-crimes-in-gaza/7925201.html	2025-01-05T15:37:58-08:00	
Ecuador's ex-VP Glas evacuated from prison after attempted killing, lawyer says	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas has been evacuated from prison after an attempt on his life, his lawyer said Sunday, blaming the government for the situation. Sonia Gabriela Vera called for the United Nations and other international organizations to intervene after what she called an 'attempted assassination' of Glas in La Roca prison. The attack 'is the result of a State that has condemned him to danger, torture and slow death,' Vera said on social media platform X, commenting on a post that claimed Glas had been taken from the prison amid a threat on his life from mutinying prisoners. 'His emergency evacuation confirms what we have denounced time and again: they are deliberately playing with his life,' Vera added. 'If anything happens to him, it will be a crime of the State.' Ecuador's SNAI prisons agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Glas was detained in April after Ecuadorean security forces stormed Mexico's Embassy in Quito, where he was holed up after seeking asylum. While Glas' supporters say the arrest is politically motivated, the ex-vice president has been convicted for corruption on two other occasions. Glas also faces charges of misusing funds collected to aid reconstruction of coastal Manabi province after a devastating 2016 earthquake.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-ex-vp-glas-evacuated-from-prison-after-attempted-killing-lawyer-says/7925198.html	2025-01-05T15:03:26-08:00	
Mali rebels: Army, Russian fighters killed 9 civilians in car attack	Nine civilians including women and children were killed in an attack on a vehicle in Mali's Segou region last week, a civil society group and a rebel coalition said late Saturday, accusing the army and Russian mercenaries of being responsible. The vehicle was traveling from the town of Niono to a refugee camp in Mauritania on Thursday when it came under fire, said Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, spokesperson for the coalition of Tuareg groups that are fighting for an independent homeland in northern Mali. He and local civil society association Kal Akal said Malian armed forces and allied fighters from Russia's Wagner private military contractor group had carried out the attack. In a separate statement, the head of Kel Ansar, one of the largest Tuareg groups, called for an investigation but said Malian troops were not behind the bloodshed. The Malian army did not respond to a request for comment. Wagner could not immediately be reached. Wagner fighters have been in Mali since the army seized power in two coups in 2020 and 2021 and kicked out French and U.N. troops. They have been supporting Malian forces in their battle with Islamist insurgents and the Tuareg separatists. In December, Human Rights Watch said Mali's armed forces, supported by Wagner, and Islamist armed groups had committed serious abuses against civilians in violation of the laws of the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-rebels-army-russian-fighters-killed-9-civilians-in-car-attack/7925194.html	2025-01-05T14:40:07-08:00	
Viola Davis, Ted Danson celebrated in film and TV at Golden Globes event	Beverly Hills, California — Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills. Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles. 'If I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn't be standing up here,' said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday. Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds. It's the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards. Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a 'dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips.' 'So I took it for the money,' said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as 'Fences,' 'The Woman King,' 'The Help' and 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama 'How to Get Away with Murder.' 'I don't believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,' she said. 'I don't think there's any nobility in poverty.' Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who 'delivers the truth every time.' Both actors worked together in the 2008 film 'Doubt,' where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her 'favorite actor in the world.' The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood's greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier. When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her an 'amazing actor.' 'It's such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,' said Danson, a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC's comedy 'Cheers.' His other credits include 'The Good Place,' 'Mr. Mayor,' 'Fargo,' 'CSI' and 'CSI: Cyber,' 'Damages' and 'Becker.' Danson currently stars in Netflix's 'A Man on the Inside,' which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall. 'Bia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: 'Ted sets the tone,'' said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself. Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including 'Pontiac Moon,' 'Gulliver's Travels' and 'It Must Be Love.' 'He's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness,' Steenburgen said. 'As his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud.' Danson traded 'I love you' with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the 'Cheers' co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event. 'I feel so grateful,' he said. 'I'm truly the luckiest... on Earth.' Davis quipped, 'Little Viola is squealing,' referring to how her younger self would be overjoyed at the actor's journey from an impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom. 'She's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress,' said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir 'Finding Me.' 'She's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel 'purty'' she continued. 'What she's whispering is: 'I told you I was a magician.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/viola-davis-ted-danson-celebrated-in-film-and-tv-at-golden-globes-event/7925189.html	2025-01-05T14:29:55-08:00	
Thousands in Montenegro demand ouster of security officials over mass shooting	Podgorica, Montenegro — Several thousand people rallied in Montenegro on Sunday demanding the resignations of top security officials over the shooting earlier this week that left 12 people dead, including two children. Chanting 'Resignations' and 'Killers,' protesters outside the Interior Ministry building in the capital, Podgorica, demanded that Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic and Deputy Prime Minister for Security and Defense Aleksa Becic step down. Milo Perovic, from a student-led group that helped organize the rally, told the crowd that innocent people died during their watch. 'You failed to protect us, so resign!' Perovic said. Hours earlier, hundreds of people held 12 minutes of silence for the 12 victims at a rally in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital where the shooting took place Wednesday. It was the second such massacre in the town in less than three years. Many residents of Cetinje and other Montenegrins believe that police mishandled the situation and haven't done enough to boost security since the first massacre, which happened in August 2022. Wednesday's shooting resulted from a bar brawl. A 45-year-old local man went home to get his gun before returning to the bar and opening fire. He killed four people there and eight more at various other locations before killing himself. The massacre fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Police have said the shooting was impossible to predict and prevent, though the gunman, identified as Aco Martinovic, had been convicted for violent behavior and illegal weapons possession. His victims were mostly friends and family. Montenegrin authorities swiftly announced a new, strict gun law and other tough measures to curb illegal weapons, which are abundant in the Balkan nation of around 620,000 people. On Sunday, police said they raided several locations in the country and confiscated about 20 weapons, more than 500 rounds of ammunition and explosives. Protesters in Cetinje and Podgorica also demanded a 'demilitarization' of the population through the destruction of illegal weapons, high taxes on gun ownership and a moratorium on new licenses while existing ones are reconsidered under strict criteria. The attacker in 2022 in Cetinje gunned down 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Maja Gardasevic, a protest organizer, said during the rally in Cetinje that 'we came here looking for answers' to several questions. 'Why did a massacre happen in Cetinje for the second time?' Gardasevic asked. 'Why is no one responsible? Why is it so hard to resign?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-montenegro-demand-ouster-of-security-officials-over-mass-shooting/7925181.html	2025-01-05T13:59:11-08:00	
Driving into Manhattan? It'll cost you; new congestion toll starts Sunday	NEW YORK — New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure. Drivers of most passenger cars will pay $9 to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for most vehicles. After years of studies, delays and a last-ditch bid by New Jersey to halt the toll, the program launched without major hiccups early Sunday. But transit officials cautioned the first-in-the-nation scheme could require adjustments — and likely would not get its first true test until the workweek. 'This is a toll system that has never been tried before in terms of complexity,' Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference held at Grand Central Terminal Sunday. 'We don’t expect New Yorkers to overnight change their behavior. Everybody’s going to have to adjust to this.' The fee — which varies for motorcyclists, truck drivers and ride-share apps — will be collected by electronic toll collection systems at over 100 detection sites now scattered across the lower half of Manhattan. It comes on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours. On Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street and 2nd Avenue. Many motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes. 'Are you kidding me?' said Chris Smith, a realtor from Somerville, New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras, circumventing the charge. 'Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should be arrested for being ignorant.' Some residents and transit riders, meanwhile, said they were hopeful the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking in their neighborhoods, while helping to modernize the subway system. 'I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,' said Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan, describing the constant din of traffic in his neighborhood as 'pretty brutal.' President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review. In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing 'will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.' Lieber, the MTA head, said he was not overly concerned that the president-elect would succeed in unwinding the program, even if he did follow through. 'I think he understands living on 59th and 5th Avenue what traffic is doing to our city,' Lieber said Sunday. Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S. Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt benefits like faster bus speeds and less traffic. In New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system. 'With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,' said Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he waited for a subway Sunday morning in Lower Manhattan. 'I don’t know if I necessarily believe it until I really see something.' The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city — the epicenter of opposition to the program — were considered to be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress. Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it. Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has vowed to continue fighting against the scheme. In response, Lieber described the New Jersey governor’s views as the 'definition of hypocrisy,' adding that he expected the state to adjust its strategy after 'losing again and again and again' in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driving-into-manhattan-it-ll-cost-you-new-congestion-toll-starts-sunday/7925179.html	2025-01-05T13:52:13-08:00

M23 rebels seize key town in eastern DRC	Kinshasa, DRC — Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized a strategic eastern town near the provincial capital Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, local politicians said Sunday. The Tutsi-led M23 group has been waging a renewed insurgency in eastern Congo since 2022. Congo and the United Nations accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing the group with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda says it has taken what it calls defensive measures. Fighting has flared in recent weeks, leading to territorial gains for M23, which is now in control of Masisi, a town and local administrative center about 80 km (50 miles) from Goma, provincial parliament member Alexis Bahunga told Reuters. 'The government will take measures to restore state authority over the entire territory,' he said. Another parliamentary deputy, Jean-Pierre Ayobangira Safari, said Masisi had been taken 'for now.' An army spokesperson declined immediate comment. Corneille Nangaa, leader of the anti-government Congo River Alliance (AFC), which includes M23, said rebel forces had reached the center of Masisi mid-afternoon on Saturday. The advance and continued fighting in defiance of a ceasefire agreement further undermined efforts to curb the conflict. A rare high-level meeting between the Congolese and Rwandan presidents was postponed in December, dashing hopes of a deal to curb the violence that has displaced more than 1.9 million people. The head of an international organization working in Masisi said staff members there were in shock and unable to continue operations as businesses were closed, making it hard to source supplies. 'They don't know how to leave the town since we fear that the ... [Congolese forces] will launch a counteroffensive,' the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rebels-seize-key-town-in-eastern-drc/7925173.html	2025-01-05T13:40:03-08:00	
Mufasa' and 'Sonic 3' rule first box office weekend of 2025	The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa' claimed the No. 1 spot on the North American box office charts over the first weekend of 2025. The photorealistic 'Lion King' prequel earned $23.8 million in its third weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Paramount’s 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' which has dominated the past two weekends, wasn’t far behind. 'Sonic 3' stayed close with a 3-day estimate of $21.2 million, bringing its total domestic earnings to $187.5 million and helping the overall franchise cross $1 billion worldwide. 'Mufasa’s' running total is slightly less, with $169.2 million. In third place, Focus Features’ 'Nosferatu' remake defied the fate of so many of its genre predecessors and fell only 39% in its second weekend. Horror films typically fall sharply after the first weekend and anything less than a 50% decline is notable. 'Nosferatu,' which added 140 screens, claimed $13.2 million in ticket sales, bringing its running total to $69.4 million since its Christmas debut. The film, directed by Robert Eggers, already surpassed its reported production budget of $50 million, though that figure does not account for marketing and promotion expenses. No new wide releases opened this weekend, leaving the box office top 10 once again to holdovers from previous weeks. Several have been in theaters since Thanksgiving. One of those, 'Moana 2,' claimed the No. 4 spot for Disney in its sixth weekend in theaters. The animated sequel earned another $12.4 million, bumping its global total to $960.5 million. The Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown,' dipped only slightly in its second weekend, bringing in $8.1 million. With $41.7 million total, it's Searchlight's highest grossing film since Disney acquired the company in 2019. A24’s erotic drama 'Babygirl,' which added 49 locations, held steady at $4.5 million. Another Thanksgiving leftover, 'Wicked,' rounded out the top five. Universal’s movie musical was made available to purchase on VOD on Jan. 31, but still earned another $10.2 million from theaters. The movie is up for several awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including nominations for Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, best motion picture musical or comedy and 'cinematic and box office achievement,' which last year went to 'Barbie.' Also in theaters this weekend was the IMAX re-release of David Fincher’s 4K restoration of 'Seven,' which earned just over $1 million from 200 locations. The 2025 box office year is already off to a better start than 2024, up around 20% from the same weekend last year. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $23.8 million. 2. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $21.2 million. 3. 'Nosferatu,' $13.2 million. 4. 'Moana 2,' $12.4 million. 5. 'Wicked,' $10.2 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $8.1 million. 7. 'Babygirl,' $4.5 million. 8. 'Gladiator II,' $2.7 million. 9. 'Homestead,' $2.1 million. 10. 'The Fire Inside,' $1.2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mufasa-and-sonic-3-rule-first-box-office-weekend-of-2025/7925135.html	2025-01-05T11:42:07-08:00	
Albanian Orthodox archbishop in critical condition	Athens, Greece — The head of the Albanian Orthodox Church, who was airlifted to a hospital in Athens due to complications from a virus, is in a critical condition, the Evangelismos hospital said Sunday. Archbishop Anastasios, 95, was taken to the Greek capital Friday evening, four days after being admitted to hospital in Tirana with what Church officials called a 'seasonal virus.' 'His Beatitude's condition is assessed as critical by the attending physicians,' the medical report from the hospital stated. On Saturday, his condition was assessed as 'stable despite his already complicated medical history.' Anastasios is credited with having revived the Orthodox Church in Muslim-majority Albania. He led the Church there for three decades. He was airlifted to Athens on a C-27 Greek air force plane following a request from Greek emergency services, the defense ministry said. Greek public television ERT reported that he was also suffering from gastric bleeding. In November 2020, he was hospitalized in Athens for 12 days with COVID-19. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Sunday afternoon the hospital where Archbishop Anastasios of Albania is being treated and was informed for the ailing archbishop's health condition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-orthodox-archbishop-in-critical-condition/7925131.html	2025-01-05T11:29:43-08:00	
Winter storm will not delay Trump election certification in Congress, House leader says	Washington — A massive winter storm moving across the United States will not keep the U.S. Congress from meeting on Monday to formally certify Republican Donald Trump's election as president, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. 'The Electoral Count Act requires this on January 6 at 1 p.m. - so, whether we’re in a blizzard or not we’re going to be in that chamber making sure this is done,' Johnson told Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' in an interview. Johnson said he hoped there would be full attendance despite the storm and that he had encouraged lawmakers to stay in the city. Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said. Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be between 7 to 18 cm, promising a difficult commute and possible closings of schools, government and businesses. Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won control of both the chambers in November's election. Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather delay. 'No change to the schedule,' said Lauren Fine, communications director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the 2020 election.

Farmers' convoys head for Paris to restart protest movement	Paris — Convoys of farmers set off Sunday to try to block roads around Paris in protest of what they say is unfair competition from overseas and excessive regulation. Farmers from France, the European Union's biggest agricultural producer, led European-wide protests at the start of 2024, but demonstrations fizzled out as the year went on. However, a move last month by the EU and South American nations in the Mercosur bloc to announce an agreement in principle on a free trade deal has given new impetus to French farmers opposed to the Mercosur deal. French farmers also remain unhappy about regulation which they say is hitting their profits. Farming trade union officials are due to meet French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Jan. 13 to express their concerns. 'They don't understand the level of misery and distress that farmers are going through at the moment,' Amelie Rebiere, vice-president of the Coordination Rurale farming trade union, told BFM TV. Those who back the EU's Mercosur deal, such as Germany, say it offers a way to reduce reliance on trade with China, and insulates EU nations from the impact of trade tariffs being threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Nevertheless, many European farmers — often led by those from France — have repeatedly protested the EU-Mercosur deal, arguing it would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, that do not meet EU safety standards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-convoys-head-for-paris-to-restart-protest-movement/7925108.html	2025-01-05T10:36:54-08:00	
Bidens to visit New Orleans, relatives of victims of terrorist attack	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with relatives of the 14 people who were killed and 35 injured there when a man drove a rented pickup truck at high speed through a group of pedestrians in the early hours of New Year’s Day. The Bidens plan to meet with family members of the victims who were run over when the suspect, identified by authorities as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old military veteran from Houston, sped down bustling Bourbon Street, a prime tourist restaurant and bar locale. Police fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers. Biden, with two weeks remaining in office before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, is also meeting with investigators who say that Jabbar acted alone in the attack but was inspired by the Islamic State to carry out the terror attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Jabbar posted five videos on social media expressing support for the Islamic State terrorist group, IS, over the roughly hour and a half before the attack as New Orleans revelers celebrated the first hours of 2025. An IS flag was found in the back of the truck. On the day of the attack, Biden, speaking from the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, offered condolences to the victims' families in a national address. 'I want you to know I grieve with you,' he said. Biden said investigators told him the suspect had a remote detonator in his truck that was meant to set off two explosive devices placed inside ice coolers along Bourbon Street. Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, on Sunday reiterated to CBS’s 'Face the Nation' show a previously disclosed U.S. claim, that there are Islamic State members and other terrorist organizations that are inside the United States 'working in conjunction with ISIS with the intention of harming Americans.' 'We don’t know where they are,' Turner said. Outgoing Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC’s 'This Week' show that there has been a 'significant increase' over the last 10 years in 'homegrown violent extremism.' 'It is a very difficult threat landscape,' Mayorkas said. He pledged a smooth transition to Trump’s appointment as the incoming Homeland Security secretary, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. 'I have spoken with Governor Noem a number of times, including on New Year’s Day and immediately thereafter, with respect to the horrific terrorist attack,' Mayorkas said. 'We have spoken substantively about the measures that we take, and I am incredibly devoted to a smooth and successful transition to the success of Governor Noem, should she be confirmed as the secretary of Homeland Security,' Mayorkas said. Biden’s Monday visit to New Orleans is occurring with heightened security concerns in Washington as Congress meets to certify that Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election. It is four years to the day after Trump supporters rampaged through the U.S. Capitol, ransacking congressional officers and attacking law enforcement officers to block certification of Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 election. Trump has vowed, within hours of taking office on January 20, to pardon many of those arrested and imprisoned in the January 6, 2021, attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bidens-to-visit-new-orleans-relatives-of-victims-of-terrorist-attack-/7925091.html	2025-01-05T10:22:33-08:00	
Hezbollah leader Nasrallah killed last year in war operations room, aide says	BEIRUT — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group's war operations room, according to new details Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah official. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sept. 27, 2023, killing Nasrallah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people died. According to news reports, Nasrallah and other senior officials were meeting underground. The assassination of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for 32 years, turned months of low-level strikes between Israel and the militants into all-out war that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months until a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. 'His Eminence [Hassan Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,' top Hezbollah security official Wafiq Safa told a news conference Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed. He said Nasrallah died in the war operations room. He did not offer other details. Lebanese media had reported that Safa was a target of Israeli airstrikes in central Beirut before the ceasefire but appeared unscathed. During the first phase of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to move its fighters, weapons and infrastructure away from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River, while Israeli troops that invaded southern Lebanon need to withdraw all within 60 days. Lebanese army soldiers are to deploy in large numbers and alongside United Nations peacekeepers to be the sole armed presence in southern Lebanon. Lebanon and Hezbollah have been critical of ongoing Israeli strikes and overflights across the country and for only withdrawing from two of dozens of Lebanese villages it controls. Israel says that the Lebanese military has not done its share in dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure. Hezbollah’s current leader Naim Kassem in a televised address Saturday warned that its fighters could strike Israel if its troops don’t leave the south by the end of the month. Safa said that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who negotiated the ceasefire deal with Washington, told Hezbollah that the government will meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein soon. 'And in light of what happens, then there will be a position,' said Safa. Hochstein had led the shuttle diplomacy efforts to reach the fragile truce.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-killed-last-year-in-war-operations-room-aide-says-/7925076.html	2025-01-05T10:02:43-08:00	
Blinken wades into political crisis with stop in South Korea	Seoul — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday opened a visit to crisis-riven South Korea where he will seek delicately to encourage continuity with the policies, but not tactics, of the impeached president. Blinken arrived in the snow-covered capital on what will likely be his final trip as the top U.S. diplomat before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. He will meet his counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Monday, the same day a warrant expires to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol who unsuccessfully tried to impose martial law on December 3. Blinken is highlighting President Joe Biden's efforts to build alliances and will head afterwards to Tokyo, making it crucial in the eyes of his advisors not to snub South Korea, which has a fraught and often competitive relationship with Japan, also home to thousands of American troops. Yoon had once been a darling of the Biden administration with his bold moves to turn the page on friction with Japan and his eye on a greater role for South Korea on global issues. Yoon joined Biden for a landmark three-way summit with Japan's prime minister and -- months before declaring martial law -- was picked to lead a global democracy summit, a signature initiative for the outgoing U.S. administration. Yoon also memorably charmed his hosts on a state visit by belting out 'American Pie' at a White House dinner. Blinken may face some criticism from the South Korean left for the visit but should be able to navigate the political crisis, said Sydney Seiler, a former US intelligence officer focused on Korea now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Blinken has a high enough profile to be above the fray, and can keep the focus on challenges such as China and North Korea, he said. 'Blinken can dodge a lot of these domestic South Korean landmines relatively easily and contextualize it not as trying to help the ruling party or artificially create a sense of normalcy where it otherwise isn't,' Seiler said. In a statement, the State Department did not directly mention the political crisis but said Blinken would seek to preserve trilateral cooperation with Japan, which has included enhanced intelligence sharing on North Korea. Blinken's visit comes at a time of change for both countries, with Trump returning to the White House on January 20. Paradoxically, while Biden worked closely with the conservative Yoon, Trump in his first term enjoyed a warm relationship with then progressive president Moon Jae-in, who encouraged the U.S. president's groundbreaking personal diplomacy with North Korea. The Biden administration has stressed since the crisis that it is reaching out to South Korean politicians across the divide, amid the uncertainties on who will lead Asia's fourth-largest economy. Progressive opposition leader Lee Jae-myung -- who himself faces election disqualification in a court case -- supports diplomacy with North Korea. But the former labor activist has also taken stances that differ from those of both Biden and Trump. Lee has criticized deployment of U.S.-made THAAD missile defenses, which Washington says are meant to protect against North Korea but which China sees as a provocation. South Korea's left has long championed a harder stance on Japan over its brutal 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula. U.S. officials said they had no warning of Yoon's imposition of martial law, which brought masses of protesters to the streets. Blinken, addressing reporters last month, said the crisis showed the strength of South Korea's institutions built in the three decades since it embraced democracy. 'I think Korea is one of the most powerful stories in the world about the emergence of democracy and democratic resilience, and we'll continue to look to Korea to set that example,' Blinken said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-wades-into-political-crisis-with-stop-in-south-korea/7925034.html	2025-01-05T08:38:27-08:00	
Russia: Ukraine launches new Kursk region offensive	Russia said Sunday that Ukraine has launched a new counterattack in the western Kursk region aimed at repelling Russian and North Korean troops trying to retake territory that Kyiv’s forces captured last August. The Russian defense ministry said Kyiv deployed 'an assault group consisting of two tanks, a mine clearing vehicle, and twelve armored combat vehicles with paratroops towards Berdin village.' Moscow said its 'artillery and aviation of the North group of (Russian) forces defeated the assault group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,' although news accounts said the outcome of the fighting was uncertain. 'Russia is getting what it deserves,' Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said commenting on the recent reports. The head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that 'defense forces are working' in the area. 'In the Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked from several directions, and it was a surprise for them,' he said. Ukrainian and Western accounts say that Russia has deployed about 11,000 North Korean troops in the Kursk region, although Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. Ukraine took the land August 6 and has held on since then even as Russia has gained territory in Ukraine’s eastern region and currently holds about a fifth of the country as the war nears the three-year mark next month. If Ukraine can hold on to the Kursk territory, it could give Kyiv a bargaining chip in any eventual peace talks with Russia. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict before he is inaugurated on January 20, but he has not said how and there is no indication of any settlement in the coming days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses in the Kursk fighting. 'In battles yesterday and today near just one village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is significant.' Zelenskyy provided no specific details. A battalion can vary in size but is generally made up of several hundred troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in response to a question at his marathon annual phone-in last month, said that Russia would force Ukrainian forces out of Kursk but declined to set a date for when this would happen. On the battlefront Sunday, Ukraine's air force said it shot down 61 out of 103 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack, the other 42 were reported lost — likely due to electronic jamming. Russia said it had destroyed five Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-launches-new-kursk-region-offensive/7924985.html	2025-01-05T07:41:11-08:00	
Syrian ministers urge lifting of US sanctions in first visit to Doha	Doha, Qatar — Ministers from Syria's transitional government urged the United States to lift its sanctions on Damascus during their first visit to Qatar since overthrowing president Bashar al-Assad. In a statement, Qatar's foreign ministry said the Gulf country's premier met with Syria's interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, defense minister Murhaf Abu Qasra and the new head of intelligence, Anas Khattab. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani 'reiterated the State of Qatar's position in support of Syria's unity, sovereignty and independence,' the statement said. Earlier, a Syrian diplomat and a Qatari official confirmed to AFP that Shaibani had arrived on Sunday morning for meetings in Qatar, the host of the U.S.'s largest military base in the region. Unlike other Arab countries, Qatar never restored diplomatic ties with Syria under Assad, who was toppled by an 11-day rebel advance that swept through major cities and then the capital Damascus in December. Following discussions with Qatar's Minister of State, Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Shaibani reiterated calls for the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The interim foreign minister called the measures a 'barrier and an obstacle to the rapid recovery' telling local media that his government 'renewed our demand for the United States of America to lift these sanctions.' At the end of December, Qatar also called for the quick removal of sanctions on Syria. The international community has not rushed to lift economic restrictions on Syria and is instead waiting to see how the new authorities exercise their power. Shaibani added that Syria would 'enjoy very good relations with the region' in contrast to those with the Assad government. Khulaifi said the new government had presented 'a clear roadmap for Syria in the near future and the steps that will be taken by the leadership and political administration in Syria.' The conflict in Syria erupted in 2011 after Assad brutally cracked down on peaceful democracy protests. It morphed into a multi-pronged war in which Doha was for years a key backer of the armed rebellion. In a statement on X, Shaibani on Friday said he would visit Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan over the coming days. 'We look forward to these visits contributing to supporting stability, security, economic recovery and building distinguished partnerships,' the foreign minister wrote. Qatar was the second country, after Turkey, to reopen its embassy in the Syrian capital following the overthrow of Assad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-ministers-urge-lifting-of-us-sanctions-in-first-visit-to-doha/7924928.html	2025-01-05T06:31:20-08:00	
Austrian People's Party nominates Christian Stocker as interim leader after Nehammer resigns	Vienna — Austrian People's Party on Sunday nominated its General Secretary Christian Stocker as interim leader after the expected resignation of Chancellor Karl Nehammer, Austrian news agency APA reported. Nehammer announced Saturday he would resign in the next few days after coalition talks with the Social Democrats collapsed. Stocker, a lawyer and member of the Austrian Parliament, has served as general secretary of the People's Party since 2022. He is seen as an experienced and calm crisis communicator who has frequently appeared in Austrian media to defend controversial decisions. It is not clear yet who will become acting chancellor until a new government is formed. Protected by special police forces, Nehammer walked across the square from the Chancellery toward the president's office in Vienna. 'What is important for me is that the way of stability and the center can be continued,' he said. Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen will make a public statement to announce the next steps once the meeting with Nehammer is over. The 52-year-old Nehammer became chancellor and conservative party leader in 2021, after his predecessor Sebastian Kurz was forced to stand down following allegations of corruption. In April 2022, Nehammer became the first European leader to visit Moscow and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine in February that year. Before going to Moscow, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Austria was thrown into political turmoil on Friday after the liberal party NEOS pulled out of coalition talks with the center-left Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. On Saturday the two remaining parties, who have a razor-thin majority in Parliament, made another attempt to negotiate and form a government — but this effort also ended in failure after a few hours, with negotiators saying they were unable to agree on how to repair the budget deficit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-people-s-party-nominates-christian-stocker-as-interim-leader-after-nehammer-resigns-/7924879.html	2025-01-05T05:36:48-08:00	
Nagasaki atomic bomb survivor, who devoted his life for peace, dies at 93	TOKYO — Shigemi Fukahori, a survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, who devoted his life to advocating for peace has died. He was 93. Fukahori died at a hospital in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan, on January 3, the Urakami Catholic Church, where he prayed almost daily until last year, said on Sunday. Local media reported he died of old age. The church, located about 500 meters from ground zero and near the Nagasaki Peace Park, is widely seen as a symbol of hope and peace, as its bell tower and some statues and survived the nuclear bombing. Fukahori was only 14 when the U.S. dropped the bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killing tens of thousands of people, including his family. That came three days after the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, which killed 140,000 people. Japan surrendered days later, ending World War II and the country's nearly half-century of aggression across Asia. Fukahori, who worked at a shipyard about 3 kilometers from where the bomb dropped, couldn't talk about what happened for years, not only because of the painful memories but also how powerless he felt then. About 15 years ago, he became more outspoken after encountering, during a visit to Spain, a man who experienced the bombing of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War when he was also 14 years old. The shared experience helped Fukahori open up. 'On the day the bomb dropped, I heard a voice asking for help. When I walked over and held out my hand, the person's skin melted. I still remember how that felt,' Fukahori told Japan's national broadcaster, NHK, in 2019. He often addressed students, hoping they take on what he called 'the baton of peace,' in reference to his advocacy. When Pope Francis visited Nagasaki in 2019, Fukahori was the one who handed him a wreath of white flowers. The following year, Fukahori represented the bomb victims at a ceremony, making his 'pledge for peace,' saying: 'I am determined to send our message to make Nagasaki the final place where an atomic bomb is ever dropped.' A wake is scheduled for Sunday, and funeral services on Monday at Urakami Church, where his daughter will represent the family.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nagasaki-atomic-bomb-survivor-who-devoted-his-life-for-peace-dies-at-93-/7924869.html	2025-01-05T05:16:43-08:00	
Costas Simitis, former Greek prime minister and socialist leader, dies at 88	ATHENS, GREECE — Costas Simitis, former prime minister of Greece and the architect of the country's joining the common European currency, the euro, has died at age 88, state TV ERT reported. Simitis was taken to a hospital in the city of Corinth early Sunday morning from his holiday home west of Athens, unconscious and without a pulse, the hospital's director was quoted as saying by Greek media. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. The government decreed a four-day period of official mourning. Simitis will receive a state funeral. Warm tributes appeared, and not just from political allies. 'I bid farewell to Costas Simitis with sadness and respect. A worthy and noble political opponent,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a Facebook post, also saluting the 'good professor and moderate parliamentarian.' Another conservative politician, former European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, recalled how he, as mayor of Athens, had cooperated 'seamlessly and warmly' with Simitis in organizing the Olympic Games. 'He served the country with devotion and a sense of duty. ... He was steadfast in facing difficult challenges and promoted policies that changed the lives of [many] citizens,' Avramopoulos added. Simitis, a co-founder of the Socialist PASOK party in 1974, eventually became the successor to the party's founding leader, Andreas Papandreou, with whom he had an often-contentious relationship that shaped the party's nature. Simitis was a low-key pragmatist whereas Papandreou was a charismatic, fiery populist. He was also a committed pro-European, while Papandreou banked on strong opposition to Greece's joining what was then the European Economic Community in the 1970s, before changing tack once he became prime minister. When the profligate first four years of socialist rule, from 1981 to 1985, resulted in a rapidly deteriorating economy, Papandreou elevated Simitis to be finance minister and oversee a tight austerity program. Finances improved, inflation was partly tamed, but Simitis was pushed to resign in 1987 when Papandreou, eyeing an upcoming election, announced a generous wages policy, undermining the goals of the austerity program. The socialists returned to power with Papandreou still at the helm in 1993, but he was ailing and finally resigned the premiership in January 1996. A tight two rounds of voting among the socialist lawmakers unexpectedly elevated Simitis to the post of prime minister, a post he held until 2004. Simitis considered Greece's entry into the eurozone, in January 2001, as the signature achievement of his premiership. But he also helped secure the 2004 Olympic Games for Athens and presided over a vast program of infrastructure building, including a brand-new airport and two subway lines, to help host the games. He also helped Cyprus join the European Union in 2004. His critics on the right and left did their best to denigrate his legacy, highlighting a dubious debt swap concluded after the country had joined the eurozone as an attempt to massage the debt numbers. In the end, it was determined opposition from his own party, including trade union leaders, to pension reform in 2001 that fatally weakened Simitis' administration. He decided to resign his party post and not contest the 2004 election, five months before the Olympics, rather than face certain defeat to the conservatives. George Papandreou, son of the socialist party's founder, succeeded him as party leader, and in 2008 expelled Simitis from the PASOK parliamentary group after the two men clashed over policies, including Papandreou's proposal to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Simitis left parliament in 2009, but not before issuing a prescient warning that financial mismanagement would bring the country under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, which would impose harsh austerity. In the end, it was the IMF, jointly with the EU, that imposed a harsh regime on a bankrupt country in 2010. Costas Simitis was born on June 23, 1936, the younger son of two politically active parents. His lawyer father, Georgios, was a member of the left-leaning resistance 'government' during the German occupation and his mother, Fani, was an active feminist. Simitis studied law at the University of Marburg, in Germany, in the 1950s, and economics and politics at the London School of Economics in the early 1960s. He later taught law at the University of Athens. His elder brother, Spiros, who died in 2023, was a noted legal scholar in Germany, specializing in data protection. Simitis is survived by his wife of 60 years, Daphne, two daughters and a granddaughter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/costas-simitis-former-greek-prime-minister-and-socialist-leader-dies-at-88/7924838.html	2025-01-05T02:43:55-08:00	
New Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active military and veterans	While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in New Orleans on New Year's and another who died in an explosion in Las Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially those that seek mass casualties. In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14 others dead and injured dozens more. It's being investigated as an act of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group. In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a 'wakeup call' and that the country was 'terminally ill and headed toward collapse.' Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or injured nearly 100 people. The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of the problem. Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found between 2017 and 2022. While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and START. More than 480 people with a military background were accused of ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill, injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious goals. The AP's analysis found that plots involving people with military backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons training or firearms than plots that didn't include someone with a military background. This held true whether or not the plots were carried out. The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around 9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the rest split among far-left or other motivations. Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S. military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who'd served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13 people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting. In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is 'committed to understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper authorities.' Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for political reasons. 'They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration,' Goldsmith said. 'And now we're in a situation where we're four years behind where we could have been.' During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the nation's largest military bases. One of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the far right, particularly if Trump's nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is confirmed. Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration in the weeks after the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member as a possible 'insider threat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attack-vegas-explosion-highlight-extremist-violence-by-active-military-and-veterans/7924110.html	2025-01-05T00:06:03-08:00	
In Gaza's crowded tent camps, women wrestle with a life stripped of privacy	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA CITY — For Gaza's women, the hardships of life in the territory's sprawling tent camps are compounded by the daily humiliation of never having privacy. Women struggle to dress modestly while crowded into tents with extended family members, including men, and with strangers only steps away in neighboring tents. Access to menstrual products is limited, so they cut up sheets or old clothes to use as pads. Makeshift toilets usually consist of only a hole in the sand surrounded by sheets dangling from a line, and these must be shared with dozens of other people. Alaa Hamami has dealt with the modesty issue by constantly wearing her prayer shawl, a black cloth that covers her head and upper body. 'Our whole lives have become prayer clothes, even to the market we wear it,' said the young mother of three. 'Dignity is gone.' Normally, she would wear the shawl only when performing her daily Muslim prayers. But with so many men around, she keeps it on all the time, even when sleeping — just in case an Israeli strike hits nearby in the night and she has to flee quickly, she said. Israel's 14-month-old campaign in Gaza has driven more than 90% of its 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of them are now living in squalid camps of tents packed close together over large areas. Sewage runs into the streets, and food and water are hard to obtain. Winter is setting in. Families often wear the same clothes for weeks because they left clothing and many other belongings behind as they fled. Everyone in the camps searches daily for food, clean water and firewood. Women feel constantly exposed. Gaza has always been a conservative society. Most women wear the hijab, or head scarf, in the presence of men who are not immediate family. Matters of women's health — pregnancy, menstruation and contraception — tend not to be discussed publicly. 'Before we had a roof. Here it does not exist,' said Hamami, whose prayer shawl is torn and smudged with ash from cooking fires. 'Here our entire lives have become exposed to the public. There is no privacy for women.' Even simple needs are hard to meet Wafaa Nasrallah, a displaced mother of two, says life in the camps makes even the simplest needs difficult, like getting period pads, which she cannot afford. She tried using pieces of cloth and even diapers, which have also increased in price. For a bathroom, she has a hole in the ground, surrounded by blankets propped up by sticks. The U.N. says more than 690,000 women and girls in Gaza require menstrual hygiene products, as well as clean water and toilets. Aid workers have been unable to meet demand, with supplies piling up at crossings from Israel. Stocks of hygiene kits have run out, and prices are exorbitant. Many women have to choose between buying pads and buying food and water. Doaa Hellis, a mother of three living in a camp, said she has torn up her old clothes to use for menstrual pads. 'Wherever we find fabric, we tear it up and use it.' A packet of pads costs 45 shekels ($12), 'and there is not even five shekels in the whole tent,' she said. Anera, a rights group active in Gaza, says some women use birth control pills to halt their periods. Others have experienced disruptions in their cycles because of the stress and trauma of repeated displacement. The terrible conditions pose real risks to women's health, said Amal Seyam, the director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza, which provides supplies for women and surveys them about their experiences. She said some women have not changed clothes for 40 days. That and improvised cloth pads 'will certainly create' skin diseases, diseases related to reproductive health and psychological conditions, she said. 'Imagine what a woman in Gaza feels like, if she's unable to control conditions related to hygiene and menstrual cycles,' Seyam said. 'Everything is destroyed' Hellis remembered a time not so long ago, when being a woman felt more like a joy and less like a burden. 'Women are now deprived of everything, no clothes, no bathroom. Their psychology is completely destroyed,' she said. Seyam said the center has tracked cases where girls have been married younger, before the age of 18, to escape the suffocating environment of their family's tents. The war will 'continue to cause a humanitarian disaster in every sense of the word. And women always pay the biggest price,' she said. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to the territory's Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its assault in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others. With large swaths of Gaza's cities and towns leveled, women wrestle with reduced lives in their tents. Hamami can walk the length of her small tent in a few strides. She shares it with 13 other people from her extended family. During the war, she gave birth to a son, Ahmed, who is now 8 months old. Between caring for him and her two other children, washing her family's laundry, cooking and waiting in line for water, she says there's no time to care for herself. She has a few objects that remind her of what her life once was, including a powder compact she brought with her when she fled her home in the Shati camp of Gaza City. The makeup is now caked and crumbling. She managed to keep hold of a small mirror through four different displacements over the past year. It's broken into two shards that she holds together every so often to catch a glimpse of her reflection. 'Previously, I had a wardrobe that contained everything I could wish for,' she said. 'We used to go out for a walk every day, go to wedding parties, go to parks, to malls, to buy everything we wanted.' Women 'lost their being and everything in this war,' she said. 'Women used to take care of themselves before the war. Now everything is destroyed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-gaza-s-crowded-tent-camps-women-wrestle-with-a-life-stripped-of-privacy/7920671.html	2025-01-05T00:04:29-08:00	
Fraud allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families	Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child? Peg Reif's daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched, children snatched off the street and sent abroad. Reif wept. She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting shook adoption communities around the world with details about how agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals, fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this system. 'I can't stand the thought that somebody lost their child,' Reif said. 'I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know how to make it right. I don't know if I can.' Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico, paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the agency's directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying, 'Thank God we don't have a child who was stolen.' But now she isn't sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after they got pregnant. Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty. 'I don't believe that anymore,' Reif said. 'I don't know what to believe.' Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide practices that routinely changed babies' origin stories to process adoptions quickly, including listing them as 'abandoned' even when they had known parents. Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what he's been hearing from adoptees: 'I'm kind of back to nothing. What do I believe now? Who can I believe?' Reif's daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was unwanted, often quipping, 'That's what happens when you're found in a dumpster as a baby.' It has taken a toll on her all her life: She's been happily married for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: 'I constantly find myself asking my husband, 'Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?' Do you want to leave me?'' She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story, with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government likened it to 'trafficking.' 'You can't make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was this huge tree of deception,' she said. 'I feel disgusted.' Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story. Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history or culpability. The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State Department has since said that it has 'been unable to identify any records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.' Korea's National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January to August. Korea's government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and 80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs. Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022, prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP stories on its website. A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be transferred from private agencies to a government department called the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically – 'possibly by tenfold,' according to Chung — yet has funding to add only five staff members to its team of six searchers. Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and birth records to be preserved after 2012. 'It's difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies in records before then,' he said. 'The adoption agency might have been at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have gone wrong at the orphanage ... no one truly knows what the truth is.' Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP's requests for comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns. Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the industry as Reif and Hamilton have. Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she looked at him, and it took her breath away. 'It can't explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life that I'm biologically related to,' she said. She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional, shocking. But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The woman's name didn't match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn't match, the birthplace didn't either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they had been pen pals. Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn't know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her birth mother. The AP's reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover after emotional meetings that they weren't related at all. Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father's side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half great aunts. 'It becomes an obsession,' Hamilton said. 'It's like a puzzle that you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.' Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required. Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents — designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not taken hold. 'We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these practices and prevent it from ever happening again,' Long said. Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to accommodate their visits. She's sad for herself, she said, but she's sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children actually had parents somewhere, searching for them. 'And I'm like, 'Why, so you can send us back?' Hamilton said. 'I don't want to be a victim.' She said she's glad she was adopted, and does not long for that different, alternative life in Korea. Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn't think she would adopt from abroad again, if she'd known then what she knows now. 'I'd rather be childless than think I have somebody else's child that didn't want to give them up,' she said. 'I think of somebody taking my child. Those poor families, I just can't imagine it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fraud-allegations-rock-south-korean-adoptees-and-families/7920666.html	2025-01-05T00:03:50-08:00	
Our county ignored Africa,' Jimmy Carter said. He didn't	NAIROBI, KENYA — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with Zimbabwe's transition from white rule to independence 'our greatest single success.' And when he died at 100, his foundation's work in rural Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of smallpox. The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling China's that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter's legacy remains most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in the 1960s and '70s. 'I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,' Carter said during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. He said the official state visit swept aside 'past aloofness by the United States,' and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together. Cold War tensions drew Carter's attention to the continent as the U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South. 'For too long our country ignored Africa,' Carter told the Democratic National Committee in his first year as president. African leaders soon received invitations to the White House, intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world's most powerful nation and what it could mean for them. 'There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,' visiting Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said. Carter observed after his first Africa trip, 'There is a common theme that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: 'We want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don't want to choose up sides.'' The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S. for influence, and access to Africa's raw materials. But neither superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to empower Africans to determine their own futures. As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key to public health. 'They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for advancing this idea,' said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal scholar. Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish, telling Playboy magazine, 'it might be that now I should drop my campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on, we'll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn't take advantage of them.' Carter welcomed Zimbabwe's independence just four years later, hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 'Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the Middle East,' historian and author Nancy Mitchell said. Relations with Mugabe's government soon soured amid deadly repression and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008, Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the country 'a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.' 'Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now, Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and '80s, will always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,' said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst. Carter also criticized South Africa's government for its treatment of Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was 'trying to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,' current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter's death. The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key role in monitoring African elections and brokering cease-fires between warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter Center's work. 'The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing to let AIDS be treated,' Carter told a local newspaper. 'That's the closest I've come to getting into a fist fight with a head of state.' Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries. Carter's quest included arranging a four-month 'guinea worm cease-fire' in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach almost 2,000 endemic villages. 'He taught us a lot about having faith,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan's health ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply their fate. 'Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them is a touching virtue.' Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the years. 'President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race, religion, or status,' Ethiopia's former health minister, Lia Tadesse, said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent's second most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm cases in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/our-county-ignored-africa-jimmy-carter-said-he-didn-t/7924799.html	2025-01-04T22:00:37-08:00	
South Korea protesters rally for, against Yoon arrest as deadline looms	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Thousands braved heavy snow in Seoul on Sunday to rally for and against arresting impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as South Korea's political crisis appeared headed toward another high-stakes confrontation. With an arrest warrant against Yoon for alleged insurrection expiring at midnight local time on Monday, multiple groups held demonstrations near his official residence, some urging his immediate arrest and others protesting against it. Yoon became the country's first sitting president to face arrest over his botched attempt to declare martial law on Dec. 3, which triggered political chaos engulfing Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. ally. The conservative president was impeached by parliament and is suspended from official duties while a court decides whether to reinstate or remove him. On Friday, criminal investigators were blocked from arresting him by Yoon's presidential security service and military troops in a six-hour standoff. Some of Sunday's protesters had gathered overnight in downtown Seoul, where temperatures fell below minus 5 degrees Celsius. More than 5 centimeters of snow piled up in parts of the capital, which was under a heavy snow warning. 'We have to reestablish the foundation of our society by punishing the president who has denied the constitution,' said Yang Kyung-soo, leader of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, or KCTU, a major labor group that took part in the protests. 'We must bring down the criminal Yoon Suk Yeol and arrest and detain him as soon as possible.' Nearby, Yoon supporters held placards reading 'We will fight for President Yoon Suk Yeol' and 'Stop the Steal,' a phrase popularized by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's supporters after he lost the 2020 election. Similar rallies drew tens of thousands on Saturday, prompting police to try to disperse KCTU protesters occupying roads and disrupting traffic. Two were detained, accused of assaulting police officers, Yonhap news agency reported. On Saturday, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which leads Yoon's criminal investigation, again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, to order the security service to comply with the arrest warrant. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-protesters-rally-for-against-yoon-arrest-as-deadline-looms-/7924795.html	2025-01-04T21:45:37-08:00	
Italian Prime Minister Meloni meets with Trump at his Florida resort	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni flew to Florida to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with Trump before his inauguration on Jan. 20. Members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared on social media by reporters and others. Her trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated Biden in the November election and is preparing his return to the White House. While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had planned to talk with Trump about Russia's war in Ukraine, trade issues, the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran, according to Italian media reports. Meloni's office declined to comment on the reports. She is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition she heads in Italy. She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help him win the election. 'This is very exciting. I'm here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy,' Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a media pool report. 'She’s really taken Europe by storm.' Trump and Meloni then sat down for a screening of a documentary questioning the criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump's unsuccessful efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian businessman, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack. On Friday, Iran's foreign ministry summoned Italy's ambassador over Abedini's detention, Iranian state media reported. Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-prime-minister-meloni-meets-with-trump-at-his-florida-resort/7924789.html	2025-01-04T21:03:00-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's state funeral has started. Here's what to know	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The first events reflected Carter's climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy. Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next: The start honors Carter's deep roots in rural south Georgia The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus. Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its way to Plains. James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents — Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency. The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother, Billy. The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn. The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House. A stop at Carter's boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried. The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president. Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family. It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate. Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global figure From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government. The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which includes Carter's presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter's son, James Earl 'Chip' Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish. Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center's annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock. What's next: A return to Washington Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades. Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-state-funeral-has-started-here-s-what-to-know/7924781.html	2025-01-04T19:55:43-08:00	
Fed's Kugler, Daly say job not done on inflation	Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S. central bank's job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try to finish that job. The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S. central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure is well down from its mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that's above the Fed's 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. 'We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping champagne anywhere,' Kugler said at the annual American Economic Association conference in San Francisco, California. 'And at the same time ... we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is' and not increase rapidly. In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and colleague Daly's view with maximum employment, the Fed's second goal alongside its price stability goal. 'At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,' said Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views, about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fed-s-kugler-daly-say-job-not-done-on-inflation-/7924763.html	2025-01-04T17:56:50-08:00	
Thousands line Suriname streets in homage to late dictator Bouterse	PARAMARIBO, SURINAME — Thousands of people lined the streets of Suriname's capital Saturday for the funeral procession of Desi Bouterse, who led the country both as a coup leader and elected president before dying as a fugitive from justice. The government of the former Dutch colony had ruled out a state funeral for Bouterse, who was sentenced in 2023 to 20 years in prison over the killing of opposition members in 1982. He went into hiding rather than report to prison and died late last month of liver failure at age 79. The hearse carrying the uniformed body of the former president led a solemn cortege through Paramaribo, joined informally by cars, buses and motorcycles as it headed first to his residence and then to the headquarters of his National Democratic Party for a memorial service. Bouterse's closest supporters, also in military uniform, followed on foot. His body was cremated later Saturday in a private ceremony. Even while on the run from the law, Bouterse remained popular among segments of the poor and working class for his policies introducing universal school meals, free health care and a minimum wage. Admirers gathered Friday evening at the NDP headquarters, many wearing the party's colors of purple and white, to sing, pray and remember the late president. 'Papa Bouta, I love you,' shouted Dennis Keyzer, a party supporter. 'We want Papa Bouta!' While the government of President Chan Santokhi had ruled out a state funeral, flags were flown at half-staff at government buildings including the presidential palace. Bouterse first came to power as a young army sergeant major after a coup in 1980, five years after Suriname, on the northeastern coast of South America, gained independence following three centuries of Dutch occupation and rule. International pressure forced him to step down after seven years, but he returned after a second coup in 1990. Bouterse left a year later, then was elected president in 2010 and governed for a decade. In December 2023, Bouterse lost an appeal against a 20-year prison sentence for the 1982 execution of political opponents. He was in hiding at an undisclosed location when he died, either on Dec. 23 or 24, an autopsy said. 'He started out as a military man, but he was a man who was able to rise and become one of the greatest political leaders,' said Jennifer Simons, president of Bouterse's party, in her speech at the funeral. Sandra, a funeral attendee who did not want to give her last name, waited for hours in her car with her family to have 'a good place' from which to watch the funeral procession. 'He was and will be my president forever,' said Harvy Lallbiharie, holding a photograph of Bouterse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-line-suriname-streets-in-homage-to-late-dictator-bouterse/7924764.html	2025-01-04T17:53:47-08:00	
Jill Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000 diamond	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a $20,000 diamond from India's leader. The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of Egypt. The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents, including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South Korea's recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official displays. The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives. Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not say what it was being used for. Ukraine's ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its 'true value … lies in its symbolism.' The embassy's spokesperson, Halyna Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value. Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S. government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with high-end items. According to the State Department's Office of Protocol, which compiles the list that will be published in Friday's edition of the Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000 combined. CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000 Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury timepieces. Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100. All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a $30,000 women's jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA employee. Another CIA employee reported receiving a men's Yacht Master II Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady's Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a $7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed, according to the list. Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jill-biden-gets-priciest-gift-from-foreign-leader-in-2023-a-20-000-diamond/7924761.html	2025-01-04T17:40:24-08:00	
Moldova breakaway region faces extended blackouts after gas cutoff	KYIV, UKRAINE — The pro-Russian breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria, left without Russian gas supplies no longer transiting through neighboring Ukraine, faced longer periods of rolling power cuts on Saturday, local authorities said. Flows of Russian gas via Ukraine to central and eastern Europe stopped on New Year's Day after a transit deal expired between the warring countries and Kyiv refused to extend it. Transdniestria, a mainly Russian-speaking enclave which has lived side-by-side with Moldova since breaking away from it in the last days of Soviet rule, received gas from Russian giant Gazprom through the pipeline crossing Ukraine. The gas was used to operate a thermal plant that provided electricity locally and for much of Moldova under the control of the pro-European central government. The region's self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said rolling power cuts in various districts would be extended to four hours Sunday. Hour-long cuts were first imposed Friday evening after heating and hot water supplies were curtailed. The cuts were then extended to three hours on Saturday. 'Yesterday's introduction of rolling cuts was a test. And it confirmed that an hour-long break to keep the electrical supply system operating was insufficient,' Krasnoselsky wrote. 'The power generated is not covering sharply rising demand.' All industries except those producing food have been shut down. The official Telegram news channel of the region's separatist authorities announced the official closure on Saturday of a steel mill and bakery in the town of Rybnitsa. Regional officials announced new measures to help residents, especially the elderly, and warned that overnight temperatures would fall to -10 Celsius (+14 Fahrenheit). Residents were told not to put strain on the region's mobile phone network. Using firewood The news channel warned against using heaters in disrepair after two residents died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a stove. Online pictures showed servicemen loading up trucks with firewood for distribution. 'Don't put off gathering in firewood,' Krasnoselsky told residents. 'It is better to ensure your supply in advance, especially since the weather is favorable so far.' Moldova's government blames Russia for the crisis and has called on Gazprom to ship gas through the TurkStream pipeline and then through Bulgaria and Romania. Russia denies using gas as a weapon to coerce Moldova and blames Kyiv for refusing to renew the gas transit deal. The Transdniestria power cuts are a problem for Moldova particularly because the enclave is home to a power plant that provides most of the power for government-controlled areas of Moldova at a fixed and low price. Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Friday his country faced a security crisis after Transdniestria imposed the rolling blackouts, but he also said the Chisinau government had prepared alternative arrangements, with a mixture of domestic production and electricity imports from Romania. Even before the halt of supplies via Ukraine, Gazprom had said it would suspend exports to Moldova on January 1 because of what Russia says are unpaid Moldovan debts of $709 million. Moldova disputes that and put the figure at $8.6 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-breakaway-region-faces-extended-blackouts-after-gas-cutoff-/7924758.html	2025-01-04T17:32:28-08:00	
Central American troops arrive in Haiti, join mission to restore order	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — About 150 military police officers from Central America have arrived in Haiti to reinforce the embattled government's fight against violent gangs that have upended daily life for millions in the Caribbean country. The deployment of around 75 security officers, mostly from Guatemala, was greeted Saturday at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince by the Kenyan commander of the U.N.-backed mission that for months has been struggling to restore order. 'The gangs have only two choices: surrender, lay down their weapons, and face justice, or face us in the field,' the officer, Godfrey Otunge, said in remarks at a welcoming ceremony. 'With the addition of the Guatemalan and El Salvador forces, the gangs will have nowhere to hide. We will root them out of their enclave.' A similar sized contingent, which also included a small number of forces from El Salvador, traveled aboard a U.S. Air Force aircraft and was greeted Friday by top Haitian officials and U.S. Ambassador Dennis Hankins. Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport have intensified in Haiti since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. Gangs are estimated to control about 85% of the capital. In what is perhaps the most brazen attack yet, gunmen opened fire on a crowd that gathered on Christmas Eve for the much-anticipated reopening of Haiti's biggest public hospital, which was closed after being ransacked by gangs earlier this year. Two journalists covering the event and a police officer were killed. Before this week's deployment, the international mission seeking to quell the violence was led by around 400 security officers from Kenya. Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad have also pledged personnel although it isn't clear when they would be sent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-american-troops-arrive-in-haiti-join-mission-to-restore-order/7924757.html	2025-01-04T17:24:41-08:00	
US finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts	WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War II. Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement released Saturday. The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said. Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in 1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely open about its past dealings with Nazis. The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was found to have a 'high relevance rate' of Nazi connections. It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an 'independent ombudsperson' by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative work. Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 'as a result of the committee's investigation,' and after UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse. In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the 'extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the leadership of UBS, has provided' since he rejoined the company. But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it held. The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal reported. In his letter, Barofsky highlighted 'especially noteworthy' discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department. 'Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating 'Amerikanische schwarze Liste' — meaning 'American Black List' — a list maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers,' he wrote. 'One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved in selling looted Jewish assets,' he added. Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse's predecessor banks. It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in his work to shed light 'on this tragic period.' The Senate panel's investigation is continuing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finds-more-records-found-linking-credit-suisse-nazi-accounts/7924755.html	2025-01-04T17:16:44-08:00	
Tesla data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy concerns	NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk's company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels. 'You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals but can anyone have access to it?' said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. Many of the latest cars not only know where you've been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing. The data collected by Musk's electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver's movements. Within hours of the New Year's Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger's movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software. 'I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,' said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. 'It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,' said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. 'When something bad happens, it's helpful, but it's a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.' General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent. Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers' sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity. Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private. 'No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you've been,' according to a statement. 'Your information is kept private and secure.' Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is 'especially worse' than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned. 'This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,' he said. 'Consumers need to have control over their data.' Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump's hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier, a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident. 'The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,' Musk wrote on X. 'Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.' Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger's journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tesla-data-helped-police-after-truck-explosion-experts-have-privacy-concerns-/7924749.html	2025-01-04T17:09:32-08:00	
Drivers skid, crash as winter storm grips central US	MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread eastward in the coming days. 'Winter returned,' said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that's when large numbers of people experience intense doses of cold. Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering. Snow and ice in forecast By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon. The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida. Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail, were also possible ahead of the storm system's cold front as it crosses the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned. Car wrecks A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said. He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway blacktop like an ice-skating rink. 'We are in it now,' Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways were nearly impassable. Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if possible and watch out for emergency vehicles. Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters warned. Getting ready Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and libraries. Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to cancel classes for one or more days. 'Get where you're going now & stay put. If you must travel, consider packing a bag & staying where you're headed,' the Missouri Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform X. The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the ability to clear roads. In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing liquids. 'It will be a major headache,' said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather. 'The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the ice threat.' Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas City area, Kines said. Temperatures dip Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic. In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border. Disruptions extend southward Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people's ability to vote in the state's special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather arrives. A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to open several garages on Sunday for free parking. The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing throughout the weekend. In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drivers-skid-crash-as-winter-storm-grips-central-us/7924750.html	2025-01-04T17:07:29-08:00	
Blinken heads to South Korea, Japan, France	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling to South Korea, Japan and France. The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul, South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of Washington-Seoul relations. The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken will speak with South Korean officials about how 'to build on our critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared values,' the State Department said in a statement. In Tokyo, Blinken will 'review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan alliance has made over the past few years,' the statement said. That includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related equipment and training to Japan. China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both Japan and the U.S. reject. Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European security, particularly in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-heads-to-south-korea-japan-france-/7924746.html	2025-01-04T16:47:22-08:00	
Exiled Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden. Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei, Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday, though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take place. 'We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities,' Gonzalez said in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January 20. Gonzalez's meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela's opposition considers the rightful president-elect. The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa Rosada, the Argentine president's official workplace, as hundreds of Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted 'Venezuela, you are not alone!' The appearance came just days before Gonzalez's rival, Nicolas Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in Caracas. The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections. Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the winner. Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his capture. Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested. Gonzalez's schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday, Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will respond. Gonzalez's visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. The relationship was already strained following an exchange of insults and, ultimately, Argentina's refusal to recognize Maduro's victory claim. The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six opposition figures accused of 'terrorism,' a matter Gonzalez had said he would take up with Milei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-venezuelan-opposition-leader-to-visit-us-speak-with-biden-/7924744.html	2025-01-04T16:34:22-08:00	
Biden honors Clinton, Bono, Goodall, others for contributions	WASHINGTON — In the East Room of the White House on a particularly frigid Saturday afternoon, President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aroused a standing ovation from the crowd as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation's highest civilian honor in a White House ceremony. 'For the final time as president I have the honor [of] bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest civilian honor, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,' Biden said in his opening remarks. 'Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done to help this country,' Biden said Saturday. 4 medals awarded posthumously Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George W. Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, 'Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.' Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics. Recipients made 'exemplary contributions' Biden has days left in the presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to valiant military veterans, courageous law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans. The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made 'exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: 'As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honor.' Sports and entertainment stars recognized include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin 'Magic' Johnson; actor Michael J. Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson's disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as 'Bill Nye the Science Guy.' Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm. Lauren is the first fashion designer to receive the honor. Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh. The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-honors-clinton-bono-goodall-others-for-contributions/7924573.html	2025-01-04T15:14:35-08:00	
Austrian Chancellor Nehammer to resign after 'new government' talks fail	VIENNA — Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Saturday he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time. The announcement came after the People's Party and the Social Democrats continued coalition talks a day after the liberal Neos party's surprise withdrawal from discussions. 'Unfortunately, I have to tell you today that the negotiations have ended and will not be continued by the People's Party,' Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer from the conservative People's Party said in a statement on social media. He said that 'destructive forces' in the Social Democratic Party have 'gained the upper hand' and that the People's Party will not sign on to a program that is against economic competitiveness. Social democratic leader Andreas Babler said he regretted the decision by the People's Party to end the negotiations. 'This is not a good decision for our country,' he said. Babler said that one of the main stumbling blocks had to do with how to repair the 'record deficit' left by the previous government. 'I have offered to Karl Nehammer and the People's Party to continue negotiating and called on them not to get up,' he told reporters Saturday evening. The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria, which has been in a recession for the past two years, is experiencing rising unemployment and its budget deficit is currently at 3.7% of Gross Domestic Product — above the EU's limit of 3%. The talks had dragged on since Austria's president tasked the conservative chancellor in October with putting together a new government. The request came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time with 29.2% of the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-chancellor-nehammer-to-resign-after-new-government-talks-fail-/7924534.html	2025-01-04T13:09:19-08:00	
Deadly bomb targets convoy carrying Pakistan security forces	ISLAMABAD — Police in southwestern Pakistan said Saturday that at least four people were killed and dozens more were injured when a bomb explosion targeted both civilian and security forces vehicles. The deadly attack occurred in the city of Turbat in the sparsely populated Balochistan province, which is well-known for its abundant natural resources. Most of the victims were reportedly members of the Frontier Corps paramilitary force. The FC protects Pakistan's borders and handles counterinsurgency operations. Rabia Tariq, a spokesperson for the provincial police, confirmed the casualty toll to the English-language DAWN newspaper. Witness accounts and footage from the scene showed a convoy of vehicles traversing the city when an explosion erupted, engulfing one vehicle in flames. An area police officer, Roshan Baloch, told VOA by phone that an explosive device was concealed within a car parked on the roadside and detonated remotely. He said that several of the wounded people were transferred to a local hospital in critical condition. The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist organization, swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that one of its suicide bombers was the perpetrator. The veracity of the claim could not be ascertained immediately. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing and expressed his condolences to the families of those 'martyred in the bomb explosion,' his office said in a statement in Islamabad, the national capital. Balochistan, the largest province in Pakistan, has regularly experienced attacks claimed by or blamed on the BLA and several smaller ethnic Baloch separatist groups. The insurgents justify their violent campaign, saying they are fighting for the independence of the province from Pakistan. Separately, authorities in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province reported a gun attack on a government convoy en route to the besieged Kurram district on the Afghan border. The district deputy commissioner was among at least four individuals injured in the attack. The victims were on their way to oversee the distribution of essential supplies, including food, fuel, and medicine, to hundreds of thousands of residents of Kurram, which has been the scene of months of violent clashes between its heavily armed Shiite and Sunni Muslim tribes in connection with a land dispute. The violence has left hundreds of people dead and injured in recent months. The latest clashes between the rival groups prompted the provincial government to close all roads leading in and out of Kurram for weeks. A peace deal brokered between the warring sides earlier in the week had raised hopes of sending essential supplies into the district, but Saturday's gun attack forced authorities to halt the aid convoy. There were no claims of responsibility for the shooting incident. Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both bordering Afghanistan, have experienced a dramatic surge in militant attacks over the past year, killing more than 1,600 Pakistani civilians and security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-bomb-targets-convoy-carrying-pakistan-security-forces/7924528.html	2025-01-04T12:45:12-08:00	
Russia-appointed officials in Crimea declare emergency; oil spill reaches Sevastopol	Russia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency Saturday, as oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula's largest city. Fuel oil spilled out of two storm-stricken tankers nearly three weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, close to eastern Crimea — about 250 kilometers from Sevastopol, which lies on the southwest of the peninsula. 'Today a regional emergency regime has been declared in Sevastopol,' regional Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Oil was found on four beaches in the region and was 'promptly eliminated' by local authorities working together with volunteers, Razvozhaev said. 'Let me emphasize: there is no mass pollution of the coastline in Sevastopol,' he wrote. Razvozhaev's announcement came after authorities in Russia's southern Krasnodar region announced a region-wide emergency last week, as the fuel oil continued washing up on the coastline 10 days after one tanker ran aground and the other was left damaged and adrift on December 15. Krasnodar regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that almost 7,000 people were still working Saturday to clean up the spill. More than 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil have been removed along the region's shoreline since the original spill, he wrote on Telegram. On December 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an 'ecological disaster.' The Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region, is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, described the oil spill last month as a 'large-scale environmental disaster' and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-appointed-officials-in-crimea-declare-emergency-oil-spill-reaches-sevastopol/7924513.html	2025-01-04T12:15:25-08:00	
Taiwan: China ups efforts to undermine democracy with disinformation	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan’s government says China is redoubling efforts to undermine confidence in the self-governing island’s democracy and close ties with the United States through the spread of disinformation, especially online. The National Security Bureau said the number of pieces of false or biased information distributed by China increased 60% last year, to 2.16 million from 1.33 million in 2023. The brief report issued Friday tallied 'pieces of controversial information,' but did not further define the term. Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, were the main conduits for disinformation, along with platforms that explicitly target young people such as TikTok, the report said. China created 'inauthentic accounts' to distribute its propaganda on YouTube, used technology such as AI to create fake videos and flooded comments sections with pro-China statements, the report said. China has for years used global social media platforms to spread official messages and misinformation even while banning them inside the country. Beijing already has considerable influence with Taiwanese newspapers and other traditional media through their owners' business interests in mainland China. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force, if necessary, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping renewing a declaration in his New Year's address that unification with Taiwan was inevitable and could not be blocked by outside forces, a likely reference to the U.S., Taiwan’s most important ally. China regularly sends warplanes, ships and balloons into areas controlled by Taiwan and holds military drills to simulate a blockade or invasion of the island. Beijing has also been building up its navy and missile forces to hit key targets and fend off American military support. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in his own New Year's address that the island would continue to strengthen its defenses in the face of escalating Chinese threats. Taiwan, he said, was a crucial part of the global 'line of defense of democracy' against authoritarian states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-china-ups-efforts-to-undermine-democracy-with-disinformation/7924490.html	2025-01-04T11:00:59-08:00	
Malaysia turns away 2 boats with nearly 300 Rohingya refugees	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysian authorities said Saturday that they have turned away two boats carrying nearly 300 people believed to be Muslim Rohingya refugees who were found to have entered the country illegally. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said that it had information that two more boats were attempting to enter the country after a boatload of 196 Rohingya landed early Friday on a beach on the northeastern resort island of Langkawi. They were all detained by authorities. The agency said authorities had detected the other two boats later Friday off Langkawi. It said the people on the two boats, also believed to be Rohingya, were reported to be exhausted and lacked sufficient food and water supplies. Maritime Enforcement Agency chief Mohamad Rosli Abdullah said in a statement that assistance has been provided to the two boats, including food supplies and drinking water, before they were escorted out of the country to continue their journey. It didn't say where the boats were heading, and no further details were given. There were also no details about where they came from, but many Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh have been lured by traffickers to leave to seek a better life elsewhere. Bangladesh hosts more than 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Malaysia is a popular destination because of its dominant Malay Muslim population. Many Rohingya fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. While Malaysia has accepted Rohingya in the past on humanitarian grounds, the country has tried to limit numbers because of fears of a mass influx of people arriving on boats. As of the end of November, there were around 111,410 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia. This makes up about 58% of the total refugee population in Malaysia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-turns-away-2-boats-with-nearly-300-rohingya-refugees/7924485.html	2025-01-04T10:48:34-08:00	
Four people shot in new attack to Indigenous land in Brazil	SAO PAULO — Four Indigenous people, including a child, were shot during an attack in southern Brazil late on Friday, federal police and an Indigenous rights organization said on Saturday, as violence escalates in the region. Attackers opened fire against the Indigenous community near the city of Guaira, in the southern Parana state, injuring four people, who were later hospitalized, the police said. The attack was aimed at the Ava Guarani people, who have been the target of previous assaults since Dec. 29, said the Missionary Council for Indigenous Peoples, or CIMI, an organization linked to the Catholic Bishops Conference of Brazil. A 4-year-old child shot in the leg was sent to a nearby hospital in the city of Toledo, alongside two other people, one hit in the leg and the other in the back, said CIMI. The group said a fourth person, shot in the jaw, was sent to a hospital in Cascavel, one of the largest cities in the state. The police said they have started investigations to track down the attackers, adding that federal, state and municipal security forces were deployed to avoid new violence in the region, which has historically faced land conflicts. Two members of the Ava Guarani people were injured in the last days of 2024, said CIMI, with one having been shot in the arm. The Ministry of Indigenous Affairs condemned the acts of violence against the Ava Guarani people, saying it is in talks with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security for the immediate investigation of armed groups acting in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-people-shot-in-new-attack-to-indigenous-land-in-brazil/7924480.html	2025-01-04T10:40:32-08:00	
Pope Francis: Bullying at school prepares students for war, not peace	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned that bullying in schools prepares students for war rather than peace, in a speech to Catholic educators gathered at the Vatican on Saturday. Speaking to about 2,000 Italian educators and parents, Francis stressed his message against bullying, asking the audience to pledge to fight against it both at school and at home. The pontiff praised educational efforts at schools to promote peace, noting that 'imagining peace' lays the foundations for 'a more just and fraternal world' through 'every subject taught and through the creativity of children and young people.' 'But if, at school, you wage war among yourselves or engage in bullying, you are preparing for war, not for peace,' he said The pope also called for more dialogue within families, emphasizing that 'it is dialogue that makes us grow.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-bullying-at-school-prepares-students-for-war-not-peace/7924473.html	2025-01-04T10:33:26-08:00	
Prince William saddened by death of former nanny's stepson in New Orleans attack	LONDON — Prince William expressed his shock and sadness Saturday at the news of the death of his former nanny’s stepson in the New Year's truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed Saturday that they are supporting the family of 31-year-old Edward Pettifer, including helping them through the process of returning his body to the United Kingdom. Pettifer, who is from west London, is the final victim to be identified. In a statement on social media, the Prince of Wales said he and his wife, Catherine, were 'shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Ed Pettifer. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this horrific attack.' Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for William and his brother, Prince Harry, between 1993 and 1999, which included the time after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. Legge-Bourke, who is also known as Alexandra Pettifer, was regularly photographed with Diana. British media also reported that King Charles III is said to be deeply saddened by the news and that he has sent his condolences to Pettifer's family. In a statement, Pettifer’s family said they were 'devastated at the tragic news of Ed’s death' and described him as 'a wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and a friend to so many.' 'We will all miss him terribly. Our thoughts are with the other families who have lost their family members due to this terrible attack,' the family added. Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former U.S. Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook account hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7924469.html	2025-01-04T10:26:24-08:00	
Ethiopia evacuates 80,000 after earthquakes, fears of volcanic eruption	Ethiopia’s government said it is evacuating approximately 80,000 people following a series of small-scale earthquakes in the Afar, Oromia and Amhara regions. At least 10 earthquakes were reported in Ethiopia since Friday, and there are signs of possible volcanic activity. The latest earthquakes shook the Awash Fentale district, which stretches between the Afar and Oromia regions, at 3:52 a.m. Saturday. The United States Geological Survey recorded an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 5.8 about 56 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Ambosa, in the Oromia region, in the early hours of Saturday. Atalay Ayele, head of the Seismology Department and a professor of seismic science at Addis Ababa University, says the epicenter was in the middle of Dofen Mountain, Awash Fentale district, in the Afar region. Just hours later a second tremor, measured at 4.7, was reported about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Awash in the Afar region. 'The events are increasing in size and frequency from time to time. In particular, this week, data shows that an earthquake measuring up to 5.8 on the Richter scale,' according to a statement issued by the federal government Saturday. The earthquake was felt in the capital, Addis Ababa, and cities such as Adama and Metehara. Residents living in condos and high-rise buildings felt it, too, reports say. As many as two dozen quakes and aftershocks were reported in Awash Fentale district since September, according to residents and officials. In the Afar region, frequent quakes created a natural hot spring water crater that is reportedly widening. No casualties were reported, but the quakes damaged dozens of homes in Afar. Fears of volcanic eruptions Friday’s tremor in Afar resulted in fears of volcanic eruptions after smoke came from vents in the Dofen volcano, signaling potential volcanic activity. 'The government is closely monitoring the events with experts in the field. In addition, it has identified the epicenter of the earthquake and deployed emergency workers from various fields in 12 kebeles [districts] to assess the extent of the damage,' the statement from Ethiopia’s government said. 'It is making great efforts to identify the most vulnerable among the 80,000 citizens living in those kebeles and to evacuate them from the area. It is also monitoring the possible impact of the earthquake on social service institutions, economic institutions, and infrastructure.' The Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission announced in a statement issued on Saturday that over 51,000 residents in the Afar and Oromia regions are at risk due to recurring earthquakes in the past two months. To mitigate the risk, more than 13,000 people have already been relocated to safer areas, the commission said. In the Fentale district of the Oromia region, over 16,000 residents face similar risks, with more than 7,000 of them relocated to secure locations, the statement added. Some residents in the affected towns said they left their homes after the quake. Zumara Mamo is a resident of Abomsa, where the quake was felt. She says the earthquake happened while she was asleep. 'I was sleeping on the floor with my child. Suddenly I felt the Earth beneath me shaking. The shock displaced the glass on my door,' she told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. According to Zumara, the shock lasted nearly a minute and was greater than the previous shock reported in the area in October. Fentale district in the Oromia region lies less than 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the epicenter of the Saturday morning earthquake near Abomsa town. Abayneh Urgo, who lives in Fentale district, said a strong earthquake shock was felt in his town and now residents are sleeping outside. Efrem Wakjira, who lives near German Square in Addis Ababa, said earthquakes have been frequent this week. 'The shock of the earthquake has been common during the past five days, but Saturday morning was quite strong. It happened at around 4 a.m. local time, and I was awakened from sleeping by the shock.' The government said the earthquake has not yet had a significant impact on major towns and has urged citizens to 'follow and strictly implement the precautionary messages issued by experts.' Ethiopian cities are vulnerable to quakes Ethiopian experts have warned that many buildings in the country, particularly in Addis Ababa, are highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Esayas Gebreyohannes, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Addis Ababa University’s Institute of Technology, said Ethiopia introduced building code standards in 1983 that need updating every 10 to 20 years, with the next update scheduled this year. 'Despite these updates, significant gaps persist in adherence to the standards during building design and construction,' he said. 'Many buildings evaluated at Addis Ababa University reveal design faults due to noncompliance with the standards. Additionally, construction materials and workmanship often fall short of required quality levels. Most buildings in Addis Ababa exhibit these deficiencies, compromising their safety and quality,' Esayas said. 'The recent frequent earthquake[s] is a sign that we are living in an active volcanic area,' professor Ayele told VOA by phone. 'The state should be careful while building infrastructures at those places. The relief agencies should stand by, and the public must also get awareness regarding the shocks,' he said. Government engineers say plans are underway to reinforce major public buildings to withstand high-magnitude earthquakes. Engineer Mesfin Negewo, director general of the Ethiopian Construction Authority, acknowledged growing concerns over the increasing frequency of earthquakes. 'We have observed frequent seismic activity over the past two months, and we are actively assessing the situation,' he said by phone to VOA. He said to address the emerging risks — the government has established task forces to study the situation and monitor incidents closely. 'These teams will present a comprehensive report to authorities,' he said. VOA’s Kennedy Abate and Mesfin Aragie contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-evacuates-80-000-after-earthquakes-fears-of-volcanic-eruption/7924462.html	2025-01-04T10:15:59-08:00	
Market fire in northern China kills at least 8, injures 15	BEIJING — A fire at a food market Saturday in northern China killed at least eight people and injured 15 others, state media said. The fire at the Liguang market in the city of Zhangjiakou, northwest of Beijing, broke out midday Saturday and was mostly extinguished by 2 p.m., Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a government official in the Qiaoxi District, where the market is located. 'The injured have been sent to hospital for treatment and are currently not in life-threatening danger,' the government official said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Such traditional markets are often tightly packed with shoppers seeking prices lower than at supermarket chains. Fire sources can range from gas bottles to charcoal used to roast meat and discarded cigarettes while aging infrastructure, such as underground gas lines, has also been blamed for fires and explosions. Footage shared online and geolocated by Agence France-Presse showed people outside the market fleeing the blaze while thick smoke billowed skyward. Other videos showed firefighters battling the flames and carrying victims away from the scene. Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often-slipshod approach to workplace safety. A blaze in the major city of Chengdu in October left 24 people hospitalized with breathing difficulties, state media reported. In July, a fire at a shopping center in the southwestern city of Zigong killed 16 people. Zhangjiakou, located in Hebei province bordering Beijing, hosted events during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Some information in this report is from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/market-fire-in-northern-china-kills-at-least-8-injures-15/7924445.html	2025-01-04T09:48:32-08:00	
Biden notifies Congress of planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of the arms in the package could be sent from current U.S. stocks, but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn't been formally sent. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more. The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The United States, Britain and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting number of deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on college campuses and unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel. The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve. In recent days, Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza that have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths since the war began more than a year ago. The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military says it targets only militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-notifies-congress-of-planned-8-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel/7924437.html	2025-01-04T09:40:58-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had suspected bomb materials at home, officials say	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — The man who rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbar in Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The FBI investigation also revealed that Jabbar purchased a cooler in Vidor, Texas, hours before the attack and gun oil from a store in Sulphur, Louisiana, the officials said. Authorities also determined Jabbar booked his rental of the pickup truck on Nov. 14, suggesting he may have been plotting the attack for more than six weeks. Authorities say 14 people were killed and some 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. Authorities found crude bombs that had been planted in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene, officials said. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional. Investigators recovered from Jabbar's rental truck a transmitter intended to trigger the two bombs, the FBI said in a statement Friday. It also said authorities found bomb-making materials at the New Orleans home Jabbar rented prior to the attack. Jabbar tried to burn the house down by setting a small fire in a hallway and placing accelerants to help spread it, the FBI said. The flames burned out before firefighters arrived. Authorities on Friday were still investigating Jabbar's motives and how he carried out the attack. They say he exited the crashed truck wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at least two officers before he was fatally shot by officers returning fire. New Orleans police declined to say Friday how many shots were fired by Jabbar and police or whether any bystanders may have been hit, citing the active investigation. Stella Cziment, who heads the city's civilian-run Office of the Independent Police Monitor, said investigators are working to account for 'every single bullet that was fired' and whether any of them struck bystanders. Bourbon Street was solemn Friday. A day after the crime scene reopened to the public, locals and tourists stopped to pay respects to victims of the attack as the sound of bucket drums echoed. People shed tears while gathering at a growing memorial. Some left flowers and candles while others dropped to their knees to say a quick prayer. 'New Orleans is about having a good time, you know, just trying to live your best life,' said Tony Lightfoot, who works in Baton Rouge and was visiting New Orleans with his son. He said the attacker 'just decided to disrupt all of that.' Thirteen people remained hospitalized. Eight people were in intensive care at University Medical Center New Orleans, spokesperson Carolina Giepert said. The White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' Police used multiple vehicles and barricades on Friday to block traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets as crowds of pedestrians swelled. Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra security, said Reese Harper, a spokesperson for the New Orleans Police Department. The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras was scheduled to take place Monday. New Orleans will also host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. 'This enhanced safety effort will continue daily, not just during large events,' Harper said in a statement. In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city had installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to bars and restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus — they stopped working reliably. So, when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno took steps toward launching an investigation of the attack. In a memo to another council member obtained by AP, Moreno said she was initiating the creation of a local and state legislative committee 'dedicated to reviewing the incident and its implications.' 'This committee will play a crucial role in assessing our current policies, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that we are adequately prepared to respond to any future threats,' Moreno wrote. The FBI concluded Jabbar was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others. Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified by the New Orleans coroner’s office, with the youngest listed as 18 and the oldest 63. Most of the victims were in their 20s. One victim was a British citizen. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attacker-had-suspected-bomb-materials-at-home-officials-say/7924423.html	2025-01-04T09:27:12-08:00	
World's oldest person, a Japanese woman, dies at 116	TOKYO — Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said Saturday. She was 116. Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on Dec. 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan. Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavored Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group. When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, 'Thank you.' When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor. Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school, and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice. She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness. Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979. She is survived by one son, one daughter and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata.

German leader worried by Musk's support of far-right AfD	BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's staying 'cool' against critical personal comments made by Elon Musk but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD. Scholz was reacting after Musk, a close ally to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, called the chancellor a 'fool' after his coalition government collapsed in November and later backed the AfD in an opinion article he wrote for a major newspaper in Germany. Scholz, head of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, or SPD, said in comments published Saturday by the German magazine Stern that there is 'nothing new' in criticism by 'rich media entrepreneurs who do not appreciate social democratic politics and do not hold back with their opinions.' 'You have to stay cool,' Scholz told Stern. 'I find it much more worrying than such insults that Musk is supporting a party like the AfD, which is in parts right-wing extremist, which preaches rapprochement with [President Vladmir] Putin’s Russia and wants to weaken transatlantic relations,' Scholz said. The AfD is monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany will hold an early parliamentary election on Feb. 23 after Scholz’s thee-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. Musk recently caused uproar after backing the AfD in an opinion article for the Welt am Sonntag, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-leader-worried-by-musk-s-support-of-far-right-afd/7924363.html	2025-01-04T08:13:40-08:00	
Cameroon says Nigerian militant attack killed government troops	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Villagers in southern Cameroon say armed men crossed the border from Nigeria and killed at least seven government troops and displaced civilians from about 15 villages. Civilians say they believe the attackers are members of a militant group. Villagers in the Akwaya district on Cameroon’s border with Nigeria’s Taraba state say several hundred armed men crossed the Moon River two times this week and launched deadly attacks on their villages. The Moon River lies to the south on Cameroon's border with Nigeria. Villagers say the water level has dropped significantly this dry season, making it easy to cross by foot. The villagers say the first attack was on Thursday, when armed men suspected to be ethnic Fulani from Nigeria entered their villages and started shooting indiscriminately in the air, torching houses and threatening to kill civilians. Cameroon's military says that it fought back and that the attackers retreated after several fighters were killed. Agwa Linus Tarnonge, traditional ruler of Bakinjaw village in Akwaya district, said villagers were surprised that the men returned on Friday, more heavily armed than they were on Thursday. 'In the cause of gun fire exchanges, some of those armed Fulani suffered casualties, and then the remaining ones retreated and came back with an overwhelming population [number of fighters], and with more sophisticated rifles,' Tarnonge told VOA by phone from Akwaya. 'They attacked our [Cameroon] military contingent that is lodged at the chief's palace in Bakinjaw, and killed five military and two gendarmes.' The Cameroon military said it lost five troops during the confrontation. Villagers say two government troops sustained injuries and died while being rushed to a hospital for treatment. Many civilians were injured, and it is too early to determine if some villagers died because of the difficult access to Akwaya, the Cameroon military says. Aka Martin Tyoga, a lawmaker and member of Cameroon's National Assembly from Akwaya, said this week's attacks are the latest in a series of what he called attempts by Nigerian militant groups to seize that area of Cameroon. 'We have asked the people to move away from the border area to the center, where we have the military that has been there since,' Tyoga said. 'We are pleading that the government should send more forces [military] because these people [armed men] come en masse; they came in 300. Their mode of operating is like Boko Haram. They enter the community and just start killing people, burning down houses.' No group has claimed responsibility, but Cameroonian government officials and Akwaya residents believe a Nigerian militant group wants to occupy the area. Cameroonian officials said troops have been deployed to the border with Nigeria around Akwaya for a search-and-rescue operation, but they have not said how many have been deployed. The Cameroonian government says it is working in collaboration with Nigerian authorities to stop the border attacks but gave no details. VOA could not independently verify if Cameroon has contacted Nigerian authorities to either investigate the origin of the armed group or collaborate with forces of the neighboring state to fight the suspected militants. Nigeria has been attempting to stop the proliferation of militant groups in its territory since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Several bombings and deadly attacks have taken place in Nigeria’s Taraba state since 2022 that were claimed by Islamic State West Africa Province or ISWAP. In 2021, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger said ISWAP was emerging as the terrorist group taking over from Boko Haram, which was weakened by the death of its leader, Aboubakar Shekau, in May of that year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-nigerian-militant-attack-killed-government-troops/7924358.html	2025-01-04T07:59:49-08:00	
How Congress will certify Trump's electoral college victory	WASHINGTON — The U.S. congressional joint session to count electoral votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. This time, Trump is returning to office after winning the 2024 election that began with Biden as his party's nominee and ended with Vice President Kamala Harris atop the ticket. She will preside over the certification of her own loss, fulfilling the constitutional role in the same way that Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, did after the violence subsided on Jan. 6, 2021. Usually a routine affair, the congressional joint session on Jan. 6 every four years is the final step in reaffirming a presidential election after the Electoral College officially elects the winner in December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes several distinct steps. What happens when Congress meets? Under federal law, Congress must meet on Jan. 6 to open sealed certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes that are used for the occasion. Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud and do an official count. The vice president, as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner. The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn’t happened since the 1800s and won't happen this time because Trump’s electoral win over Harris was decisive, 312-226. How has it changed since the last time? Congress tightened the rules for the certification after the violence of 2021 and Trump’s attempts to usurp the process. In particular, the revised Electoral Count Act passed in 2022 more explicitly defines the role of the vice president after Trump aggressively pushed Pence to object to the Republican's defeat — an action that would have gone far beyond Pence's ceremonial role. Pence rebuffed Trump and ultimately gaveled down his own defeat. Harris will do the same. The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6. Harris and Pence were not the first vice presidents to be put in the uncomfortable position of presiding over their own defeats. In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election that he narrowly lost to Republican George W. Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats’ objections out of order. In 2017, Biden as vice president presided over the count that declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House Democrats that did not have any Senate support. How does the session unfold? The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states. The appointed 'tellers' from the House and Senate, members of both parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the most votes for president and vice president. What if there's an objection? After a teller reads the certificate from any state, a lawmaker can stand up and object to that state’s vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by one-fifth of each chamber. That threshold is significantly higher than what came before. Previously, a successful objection only required support from one member of the Senate and one member of the House. Lawmakers raised the threshold in the 2022 law to make objections more difficult. If any objection reaches the threshold — something not expected this time — the joint session suspends, and the House and Senate go into separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must uphold it by a simple majority vote. If they do not agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes. In 2021, both the House and Senate rejected challenges to the electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Before 2021, the last time that such an objection was considered was 2005, when Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio’s electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. The House and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the second time such a vote had occurred. What happens next? After Congress certifies the vote, the president is inaugurated on the west front of the Capitol on Jan. 20. The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond any challenges in court. Harris has conceded and never disputed Trump’s win.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-congress-will-certify-trump-s-electoral-college-victory/7924343.html	2025-01-04T07:37:34-08:00

Jimmy Carter's state funeral starts Saturday. Here is what to know	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter begin Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The first events reflect Carter’s climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy. Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next: Start honors Carter's roots in rural Georgia The proceedings are scheduled to begin at 10:15 a.m. Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus. Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains. James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on October 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency. The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy. The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn. The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House. A stop at Carter's boyhood home The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried. The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president. Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse, and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family. It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate. Lying in repose in Atlanta From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government. The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock. The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish. Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board. A return to Washington Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades. Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-state-funeral-starts-saturday-here-is-what-to-know/7924279.html	2025-01-04T05:59:40-08:00	
Cybertruck soldier told ex-girlfriend of pain, exhaustion after Afghanistan	WASHINGTON — The highly decorated Special Forces soldier who died by suicide in a Cybertruck explosion on New Year's Day confided to a former girlfriend who had served as an Army nurse that he faced significant pain and exhaustion that she says were key symptoms of traumatic brain injury. Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time recipient of the Bronze Star, including one with a V device for valor under fire. He had an exemplary military record that spanned the globe and a baby born last year. But he struggled with the mental and physical toll of his service, which required him to kill and caused him to witness the deaths of fellow soldiers. Livelsberger mostly bore that burden in private but recently sought treatment for depression from the Army, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. He also found a confidant in the former nurse, who he began dating in 2018. Alicia Arritt, 39, and Livelsberger met through a dating app while both were in Colorado Springs. Arritt had served at Landstul Regional Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. military medical facility in Europe, where many of the worst combat injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan were initially treated before being flown to the United States. There she saw and treated traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, which troops suffered from incoming fire and roadside bombs. Serious but hard to diagnose, such injuries can have lingering effects that might take years to surface. 'I saw a lot of bad injuries. But the personality changes can happen later,' Arritt said. In texts and images he shared with Arritt, Livelsberger raised the curtain a bit on what he was facing. 'Just some concussions,' he said in a text about a deployment to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. He sent her a photo of a graphic tattoo he got on his arm of two skulls pierced by bullets to mark lives he took in Afghanistan. He talked about exhaustion and pain, not being able to sleep and reliving the violence of his deployment. 'My life has been a personal hell for the last year,' he told Arritt during the early days of their dating, according to text messages she provided to The Associated Press. 'It’s refreshing to have such a nice person come along.' On Friday, Las Vegas law enforcement officers released excerpts of messages Livelsberger left behind showing the way Livelsberger killed himself was intentional, meant both as a 'wakeup call' but also to 'cleanse the demons' he was facing from losing fellow soldiers and taking lives. Livelsberger’s death in front of the Trump Hotel using a truck produced by Elon Musk’s Tesla company has raised questions as to whether this was an act of political violence. Officials said Friday that Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, and Arritt said she and Livelsberger were Tesla fans. 'I had a Tesla, too, that I rescued from a junkyard in 2019, and we used to work on it together, bond over it,' Arritt said. The pair stopped talking regularly after they broke up in 2021, and she had not heard from him in more than two years when he texted out of the blue on Dec. 28, and again on Dec. 31. The upbeat messages included a video of him driving the Cybertruck and another one of its dancing headlights; the vehicle can sync up its lighting and music. But she also said Livelsberger felt things 'very deeply, and I could see him using symbolism' of both the truck and the hotel. 'He wasn’t impulsive,' Arritt said. 'I don’t see him doing this impulsively, so my suspicion would be that he was probably thinking it out.' Arritt served on active duty from 2003 to 2007 and then was in the Army Reserve until 2011. With Livelsberger, she saw symptoms of TBI as early as 2018. 'He would go through periods of withdrawal, and he struggled with depression and memory loss,' Arritt said. 'I don’t know what drove him to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed it.' But Livelsberger was also sweet and kind, she recalled: 'He had a really deep well of inner strength and character, and he just had a lot of integrity.' Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday that it has turned over all Livelsberger's medical records to local law enforcement and encouraged troops facing mental health challenges to seek care through one of the military's support networks. 'If you need help, if you feel that you need to seek any type of mental health treatment, or just to talk to someone — to seek the services that are available, either on base or off,' Singh said. When Livelsberger struggled during the time they were dating, Arritt prodded him to get help. But he would not, saying it could cost him his ability to deploy if he was found medically unfit. 'There was a lot of stigma in his unit; they were, you know, big, strong, Special Forces guys there. There was no weakness allowed, and mental health is weakness is what they saw,' she said. Livelsberger seeking treatment for depression was first reported by CNN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybertruck-soldier-told-ex-girlfriend-of-pain-exhaustion-after-afghanistan/7924262.html	2025-01-04T05:40:04-08:00

South Korea says fatal crash cockpit transcript nearly complete	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators said Saturday they were close to finalizing the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder from a fatal plane crash that left 179 people dead last week. The recording may hold clues to the final moments of Jeju Air flight 2216, which was carrying 181 passengers and crew from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it belly-landed before slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of an airport runway. South Korean and U.S. investigators, including from the aircraft's manufacturer Boeing, have been combing the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster to establish a cause. 'The transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) is expected to be completed today, and the flight data recorder (FDR) is in the process of being prepared for transport to the United States' for analysis, South Korea's land ministry said in a statement. Investigators also recovered the aircraft engine from the crash site this week, the ministry added. The exact cause of the Boeing 737-800 crash is still unknown, but investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues. Authorities this week carried out search and seizure operations at Muan airport where the flight crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital of Seoul, police said. Jeju Air's chief executive Kim E-bae has been banned from leaving the country as the investigation continues, police also said. The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing and then crashing on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. Dramatic video showed the plane colliding with the concrete barrier at the end of the runway before bursting into flames. Authorities have started lifting the wreckage of the jet, and returning some of the identified victims' bodies and personal belongings recovered from the crash site to grieving families. The plane was largely carrying South Korean holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, except for two Thai passengers. Images from local media showed authorities handing over items including smartphones, and dried mango and coconut sourced from Thailand.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-fatal-crash-cockpit-transcript-nearly-complete/7924194.html	2025-01-04T01:41:17-08:00	
South Korea investigators ask acting president to clear way for Yoon's arrest	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The security service, along with military troops, on Friday prevented prosecutors from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol in a six-hour standoff inside Yoon's compound. The investigators secured the warrant to arrest Yoon over his brief declaration of martial law last month. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said on Saturday it had again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the nation's finance minister, to order the presidential security service to cooperate with the warrant. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment. Yoon's Dec. 3 martial declaration stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-ask-acting-president-to-clear-way-for-yoon-s-arrest/7924192.html	2025-01-04T01:31:27-08:00	
Palestinian health ministry says 1 dead in Israel West Bank raid	RAMALLAH, WEST BANK — The health ministry in the occupied West Bank said one person was killed and nine injured in an Israeli raid on a refugee camp, with the Israeli military saying Saturday it had opened fire at 'terrorists.' An 18-year-old man, Muhammad Medhat Amin Amer, 'was killed by bullets from the (Israeli) occupation in the Balata camp' in the territory's north, the Palestinian health ministry said in a late-night statement, adding that nine people were injured, 'four of whom are in critical condition.' According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the raid began on Friday night and triggered violent clashes. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli troops entered the camp from the Awarta checkpoint and 'deployed snipers on the rooftops of surrounding buildings.' In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli military said that during the 'counterterrorism' operation, 'terrorists placed explosives in the area in order to harm (military) soldiers, hurled explosives, Molotov cocktails, and rocks and shot fireworks at the forces.' 'The forces fired toward the terrorists in order to remove the threat. Hits were identified,' the statement said. Violence in the West Bank has intensified since war broke out in the Gaza Strip after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Since then, at least 815 Palestinians have been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. In the same period, Palestinian attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 25 Israelis, according to official Israeli figures. Israel has occupied the West Bank since conquering it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-health-ministry-says-1-dead-in-israel-west-bank-raid/7924180.html	2025-01-04T00:53:37-08:00	
US state of Tennessee refuses to release its new execution manual	NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — Just days after Tennessee announced it had a new manual for executing death row inmates, the state's top prison officials said they aren't going to release the document to the public. The Tennessee Department of Correction had told The Associated Press to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week denied the AP's request, saying it needs to keep the entire document secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved. The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems. Here's what to know: What is an execution protocol? The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave instructions on the inmate's housing, diet and visitation in the days leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media witnesses. For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised protocol. What reason does Tennessee give for not releasing the new protocol? In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla Hackney told the AP the 'protocol is not a public record' and cited a Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out executions confidential. However, that same statute says the existence of confidential information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting that the confidential information should be redacted. What has Tennessee done in the past? In 2018, Tennessee's correction agency provided a redacted copy of the protocol to an AP reporter over email. In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter's review of that 100-page 'Manual of Execution' found a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for electrocution. Why did Tennessee update its protocol? Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the execution drugs for potency and purity. An independent review of the state's lethal injection practice later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General's Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee's lethal injection drugs 'incorrectly testified' under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required. So what's with all the secrecy? Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections. Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials. Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender's habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee's death row inmates, described the state's refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as 'mystifying.' 'The secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,' she said in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-of-tennessee-refuses-to-release-its-new-execution-manual/7922881.html	2025-01-03T23:49:36-08:00

Deadly accident has Hawaii officials pleading for end to amateur fireworks shows	honolulu — In recent years, occasions large and small — parties, Super Bowls, mixed martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving — have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks. The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter's home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor. Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths. But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. On Friday, the Honolulu medical examiner's department identified two of the women as Nelie Ibarra, 58, and Jennifer Van, 23. The cause and manner of death for both were listed as pending. The identity of the third was not yet confirmed, the department said in a news release. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu. Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down. 'This incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,' Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. 'They put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.' Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis. The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Governor Josh Green. And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations. Representative Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it's a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today. 'The kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,' he said. 'And so the danger is magnified.' Charmaine Doran, the vice chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: 'They have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I'm pretty old.' In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year's. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day. Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where 'we're related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,' Doran said. People fear retribution, she added: 'If I dial 911, they're going to egg my house.' That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threatened by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve until after midnight. 'It was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,' Takushi said. 'He has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.' Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities. Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear. 'A string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,' Takushi said. Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu's hot spots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives. He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if 'they can't catch people in the act.' Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles. 'We already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,' he said. 'I mean, we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.' The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii's ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks, and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said. 'We need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they're in the community, it's very difficult to track them down,' Takayama said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-accident-has-hawaii-officials-pleading-for-end-to-amateur-fireworks-shows/7924118.html	2025-01-03T23:47:28-08:00	
Ghana’s citizenship offer attracts some Black Americans	ACCRA, GHANA — Flipping through a family album, Keachia Bowers paused on a photo of her as a baby on her father's lap as he held the 1978 album 'Africa Stand Alone' by the Jamaican reggae band Culture. 'When I was 10 years old, I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,' she said. A day earlier, she had marked 10 years since her father's death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he never made it here. Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, however, are among the 524 diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian citizenship in a ceremony in November. Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting the region several times between them since the '90s. They now run a tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent move. The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the 'Year of the Return' program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619. Ghana's Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into 'Beyond the Return,' which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica. Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn't have in the U.S. 'When we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,' she said. She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14. Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family's dog, Apollo. 'In America, being a Black male with locs who's very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,' Bowers said. Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana. 'I didn't need (citizenship) to tell me that I'm African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I'm melanated,' she said. 'But my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,' she said, 'that passport, for me, is for them.' Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa. Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure. As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the 'Door of No Return,' haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time. The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering. Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them. 'I first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,' she said. She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu's Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food. Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch. Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship. 'It just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don't have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I've done something right,' she said. Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process. The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship. Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate. Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible. 'I don't think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they've found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it's something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,' he said. President Nana Akufo-Addo's administration, which launched the 'Year of the Return,' is on its way out. Ghana's main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7. But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession. Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony. Bowers' father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. 'Part of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,' she said. She believes that her father is proud of her. 'I really feel like he's smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he's experiencing it through me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-citizenship-offer-attracts-some-black-americans/7924102.html	2025-01-03T23:46:54-08:00	
Danish-Swedish farmdog joins American Kennel Club's lineup	NEW YORK — Say hello to the latest dog in the American Kennel Club's lineup of recognized breeds. Or you might say 'hej.' The Danish-Swedish farmdog — yep, that's the official name — joined the pack Thursday. The designation makes the breed eligible to compete for many best in show trophies, and it likely augurs more widespread interest in the small, sprightly dogs. The prospect both gladdens and concerns their biggest fans. 'We're excited about it. We're looking forward to it,' said Carey Segebart, one of the people who worked to get Danish-Swedish farmdogs recognized by the AKC. She proudly plans to debut one of her own at a dog show this month near her Iowa home. Still, she thinks increased exposure is 'a double-edged sword' for the fleet, versatile pups. 'We don't want the breed to just explode too quickly,' she said. Called the farmdog or DSF for short, the breed goes back centuries in parts of what are now Denmark, southern Sweden and some other European countries, according to the Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America. 'They're interesting, fun little dogs,' said Segebart, who has owned them since 2011 and is the club's incoming president. 'They're essentially up for anything. They succeed at most everything.' In their original homelands, the dogs' main job was rodent patrol, but they also would herd a bit, act as watchdogs and play with farmers' children. Some even performed in circuses, according to the club. After Denmark and Sweden became more urban and suburban in the 20th century, farmdog fanciers set out to secure the breed's place in both nations (where 'hej' translates to the English 'hello'). Kennel clubs there began registering farmdogs in 1987. In the U.S., many of the just about 350 farmdogs nationwide compete in agility, obedience or other canine sports that are open to all dogs, including mixed breeds. But until now, farmdogs couldn't enter the traditional breed-by-breed judging that leads to best in show prizes at events including the prominent Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York. The entry deadline has passed for February's Westminster show, so farmdogs will have to wait for 2026 there, but they may well appear later this year at two other major, televised shows, the National Dog Show and AKC National Championship. The Danish-Swedish farmdog is the AKC's 202nd breed and 'a wonderful addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and mental stimulation that it needs,' said the club's Gina DiNardo. Too popular for its own good? The AKC is the United States' oldest purebred dog registry and essentially a league for many dog competitions. Registration is voluntary, and requirements for breed recognition include at least 300 pedigreed dogs spread through at least 20 states. Some breeds are in other kennel clubs or none at all. Danish-Swedish farmdog fanciers deliberated for several years before pursuing AKC recognition and the attention that's likely to come with it, Segebart said. The number of farmdog puppy-seekers has grown substantially over the last decade; each of the few breeders receives multiple inquiries a week, and the typical wait for a puppy is a year or more, she said. Farmdog folk fear that their appealing, relatively easy-care breed could quickly become too popular for its own good. They're not the first to worry: Much fur has flown in dogdom over the rise of the French bulldog, which the AKC now ranks as the most popular breed in the country. Some animal rights activists echo those concerns to argue against dog breeding in general. They say purebred popularity trends divert people from adopting shelter animals, fuel puppy mills and prize dogs' appearance over their health. The AKC says it promotes responsibly 'breeding for type and function' to produce dogs with at least somewhat predictable traits, whether as basic as size or as specialized as bomb-sniffing skills. The club says it has given over $35 million since 1995 to its canine health research charity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-swedish-farmdog-joins-american-kennel-club-s-lineup-/7922875.html	2025-01-03T23:46:17-08:00	
Scientists hail impact of Ethiopia's Lucy fossil on understanding humans	washington — On a sunny Sunday morning along the Awash River in the small Ethiopian town of Hadar, a newly minted Ph.D. from the University of Chicago uncovered a fossil-rich site that would redefine human history. Fossil hunting in the area was no accident — elephant, pig, rhino and antelope remains were abundant. Driven by optimism, he says he hoped to uncover something extraordinary: a human ancestor fossil. 'I looked over my right shoulder, I saw a little fragment of bone, and I recognized it as coming from one of the bones in the arm, the bone that allows us to flex and extend our arm,' scientist Donald Johanson recalled. 'I looked at it. I thought at first maybe it was a baboon,' he said. 'It was very tiny. As I examined it more closely, I could see the anatomy was the anatomy of a human ancestor … and as I looked around, I found fragments of a skull, fragments of a jaw, and it was part of a skeleton.' Johanson, along with graduate student Tom Gray, had made one of the most important findings in paleontology, discovering a 3.2 million-year-old human ancestor fossil, about 40% complete. That was 50 years ago. The discovery of Lucy, or 'Dinknesh' as the remains are locally known, changed not just Johanson’s career but it also shed new light on how humans evolved and changed over time, according to Johanson, who became a founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. 'She and many of the fossils we found tell us that all humans on the planet came from Africa, that Africa is the homeland for humanity, and that we have a common past, no matter the color of our skin, the shape of our eyes, the texture of our hair. We carry the genes of Africa in all of us,' Johanson told VOA Horn of Africa, reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the discovery of iconic Lucy on Nov. 24, 1974. 'We should be thinking about a common future for the species Homo sapiens that we have become today,' he said. The discovery attracted scientists from around the world to the region, spurring extensive research and inspiring Ethiopian scientists to make significant findings of their own. Among them is Zeresenay Alemseged, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Chicago, who said Lucy is the earliest and most complete human ancestor fossil ever uncovered. The discovery 'literally transformed our knowledge of human evolution,' he said. 'At that point, the earliest humans, meaning apart walking creatures, were considered to have lived 2 million years ago, but with the discovery of Lucy, that number changed by a whopping 1 million years,' Zeresenay said. 'Lucy continues to serve us as a benchmark, as a reference point for discoveries. So, her influence and impact was huge,' he said. While completing his studies in Addis Ababa, Zeresenay was assigned to the National Museum of Ethiopia, home to Lucy's fossil. This opportunity allowed him to study a wealth of discoveries made by scientists from around the globe, including Johanson. In 2000, Zeresenay made his own discovery, a fossil that was over 60% complete, which lived 150,000 years before Lucy. The fossilized remains, called Selam, were from a child who died at the age of 2-1/2 or 3, which Zeresenay said is a very rare occurrence. 'In terms of discovery, most of the fossils that we find come from adult individuals, so in many ways, she represents the earliest and most complete child ever discovered in the history of paleoanthropology,' he told VOA. 'Her contribution to the scientific community is that she fills in a major gap that continues to puzzle us because we don't normally discover juvenile individuals, young individuals, infants, much less a complete skeleton of an infant.' Zeresenay explained that the discoveries of Lucy and Selam have been instrumental in public outreach efforts for Ethiopia. Selam was uncovered in 2000 in Dikika, in the Afar region of the country. 'Even the new motto of the Tourism Commission in Ethiopia — 'The land of Origins' — was coined by me,' he said. 'I, of course, leaned on both Selam and Lucy, but many other discoveries, to show that the country is the land of origins — the cradle of mankind — and also the origin of many things, including the Nile, coffee, et cetera.' The discovery of Selam was made in a dangerous area contested by rival clans of Afar and Issa ethnic groups where land disputes lead to deadly violence among neighboring communities. Zeresenay named his fossil Selam — or 'Peace,' in Amharic, Tigrigna and Arabic — which was proposed by museum visitors who viewed the fossil. He said he hoped there would be peace in the area of the discovery as Ethiopian Afar and Issa communities continue to clash over land disputes. 'If we see so much misery and problems in Africa and other parts of the world, it's really for lack of having a good understanding, a scientific understanding, a technological understanding of what is around us,' Zeresenay said. 'So I would urge our young population to be keen about science and technology.'

Myanmar junta to free 5,864 prisoners under amnesty	Myanmar's military government will release 5,864 prisoners, including 180 foreigners, under an amnesty marking the Southeast Asian nation's independence day, state media said Saturday. Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021, when the military overthrew an elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion. The junta has said it will hold elections this year, but the plan has been widely condemned by opposition groups as a sham. Among those still imprisoned by the junta is the country's former leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The 79-year-old is serving a 27-year sentence tied to 14 criminal charges ranging from incitement and election fraud to corruption. She denies all the charges, according to her lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-to-free-5-864-prisoners-under-amnesty/7924153.html	2025-01-03T21:25:03-08:00	
Moldovan PM warns of security crisis after cutoff of Russian gas	Kyiv, ukraine — Moldova faces a security crisis, Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Friday, after its separatist pro-Moscow Transdniestria region, cut off from supplies of Russian gas, closed factories, restricted central heating and imposed rolling power blackouts. Flows of Russian gas via Ukraine to central and eastern Europe were halted on New Year's Day after a transit agreement between the warring countries expired and Kyiv rejected doing further business with Moscow. Recean said government-controlled Moldova would cover its own energy needs with domestic production and imports but noted the separatist Transdniestria region had suffered a painful hit despite its ties with Moscow. 'By jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has backed for three decades in an effort to destabilize Moldova, Russia is revealing the inevitable outcome for all its allies – betrayal and isolation,' Recean said in a statement. 'We treat this as a security crisis aimed at enabling the return of pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova and weaponizing our territory against Ukraine, with whom we share a 1,200 km border.' The official Telegram news channel of separatist Transdniestria said rolling power cuts had gone into effect on Friday evening. It listed districts where power would be cut for an hour or more between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. 'As the Ministry of Economic Development notes, this is in connection with the fact that residents at this time are consuming more power than the system can generate,' the channel said. The news channel said a sanatorium, fully heated and with hot water, was sheltering orphans and residents of nursing homes. It accused Moldova's central government of failing to understand or tackle the difficulties facing the region. 'Moldovan authorities are completely out of touch with reality and continue to talk about 'the price of freedom from Russian gas,' ' the channel said. Transdniestria's residents had already lost hot water and central heating, and all factories except food producers have been forced to stop production. The enclave's self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, had earlier said power cuts were inevitable. He said the region had gas reserves to cover 10 days of limited usage in the north and twice as long in the south. Russia denies using gas as a weapon to coerce Moldova and blames Kyiv for refusing to renew the gas transit deal. Dispute over arrears Russian gas giant Gazprom had separately said on December 28 that it would suspend exports to Moldova on January 1 because of what Russia says are unpaid Moldovan debts of $709 million. Moldova disputes that and has put the figure at $8.6 million. The southeast European nation of about 2.5 million people has been in the spotlight since Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine at a time of mounting tensions between Moscow and the West. Its pro-European president, Maia Sandu, won a second term in an election last year and has pledged to accelerate reform and consolidate democratization. Moldova plans to hold a parliamentary election this summer. Mainly Russian-speaking Transdniestria, which split from Moldova in the 1990s, received Russian gas via Ukraine. In turn, Moldova used to receive the bulk of its electricity from Transdniestria. But, with Kyiv making clear it would stop gas transit from Russia, the Chisinau government prepared alternative arrangements, with a mixture of domestic production and electricity imports from Romania, Recean said. He said the Moldovan government remained committed to helping the enclave. 'Alternative energy solutions, such as biomass systems, generators, humanitarian aid and essential medical supplies, are ready for delivery should the breakaway leadership accept the support,' the government said in a statement. The head of Moldova's national gas company Moldovagaz, Vadim Ceban, said Transdniestrian authorities had turned down an offer to help purchase gas from European countries because the enclave believes Russian gas supplies could still be resumed. Such purchases would be more costly. Gazprom has long supplied gas to the region without demanding payment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-pm-warns-of-security-crisis-after-cutoff-of-russian-gas-/7924132.html	2025-01-03T18:53:25-08:00	
National funeral service, flyover and 39 bells for Carter sendoff	PLAINS, GEORGIA — Mourners are to begin paying their respects to Jimmy Carter on Saturday, kicking off a carefully choreographed six-day farewell for America's longest-lived president. Flags have been flying at half-staff across the country since Carter died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100 in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Carter's state funeral officially begins on Saturday with Secret Service agents from his current and former protective detail carrying his casket to a hearse for a tour through Plains. The motorcade bearing his remains is to pause at Carter's boyhood family peanut farm while a farm bell rings 39 times in honor of America's 39th president. His body will then be taken to Atlanta for a brief stop at the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator before becoming governor, and a moment of silence. From there, Carter will be escorted to the Carter Presidential Center where he will lie in repose from 7 p.m. on Saturday (0000 GMT Sunday) to 6 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Tuesday to allow the public to pay their respects. Carter's remains will be flown on Tuesday morning from a military base in Georgia to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on a U.S. Air Force plane dubbed Special Air Mission 39. A motorcade will then transport the body of the former commander-in-chief to the U.S. Navy Memorial. Carter, who attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946, and served on submarines, will be transferred from a hearse to a horse-drawn caisson for a funeral procession to the U.S. Capitol. Military pall bearers will carry his flag-draped casket to the rotunda of the Capitol where his body will lie in state until 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) on Thursday, surrounded by a guard of honor of service members. Carter will be the 13th former U.S. president to lie in state in the Capitol. Abraham Lincoln, assassinated in 1865, was the first. A national funeral service is to be held on Thursday at the National Cathedral, an Episcopal church in the nation's capital that also hosted state funerals for former presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. All four living former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump — are expected to attend. President Joe Biden is to deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat, who served in the White House from 1977-81. Biden has declared Thursday to be a national day of mourning, and federal government offices are to be closed for the day. He has also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for 30 days as is customary, which means that will be the case during Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. That drew the ire of the president-elect, who took to Truth Social to say 'no American can be happy' about having flags at half-staff when he takes office. Following the cathedral service, Carter's remains will be flown aboard Special Air Mission 39 back to Georgia for a private funeral service at the Baptist church in Plains where Carter taught Sunday school. A final motorcade through his hometown will ferry Carter's body to a burial plot at his residence. U.S. Navy jets will conduct a flyover in his honor before he is laid to rest alongside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, who died in 2023 at the age of 96.	https://www.voanews.com/a/national-funeral-service-flyover-and-39-bells-for-carter-sendoff/7924128.html	2025-01-03T18:39:40-08:00	
US new car sales hit 5-year high in 2024, helped by hybrids	DETROIT — U.S. new car sales in 2024 continued to rise from their pandemic lows, bolstered by replenished inventories, higher incentives and surging demand for hybrid vehicles, automakers reported on Friday. Sales of new vehicles finished at 15.9 million last year, according to Wards Intelligence, up 2.2% from the prior year, and the highest since 2019. Automakers are projecting strong sales will continue into 2025, although President-elect Donald Trump's proposed automotive policies, such as removing tax credits for EVs, present a wild card. 'We’re carrying significant momentum into 2025,' Rory Harvey, GM's head of global markets, said in a release. The Detroit automaker defended its 2023 crown as the biggest U.S. carmaker by sales, selling 2.7 million vehicles last year, the company said on Friday, up 4.3% from 2023. Most automakers recorded solid sales results last year, as they adjusted to slowing demand for EVs and relied on their core business of gasoline-powered trucks and SUVs. Others capitalized on soaring consumer interest in hybrid vehicles. Sales of traditional hybrids increased 36.7% in 2024 compared with the previous year, Wards reported. 'Hybrids, we're sold out' Toyota notched a 3.7% sales gain year-over-year in the U.S., boosted by steady increases of reliable smaller vehicles such as the Camry and RAV4 SUV, as well as significant gains for hybrid vehicles. Reuters reported last year that the automaker is potentially converting all of its lineup into hybrid-only models. 'For hybrids, we’re sold out — customers want them. We can’t get enough of them,' said David Christ, head of sales and marketing for Toyota in North America. 'Battery electric vehicles, even with the huge incentives we’re spending and the federal government’s incentives, are just not as in demand.' Ford Motor also benefited from an increase in hybrid sales, which helped the automaker's total vehicle sales rise 4.2% in 2024. The Dearborn, Michigan, company's total hybrid sales roughly doubled that of its EVs, with 187,426 hybrids sold and 97,865 EVs. Automakers have axed or changed lofty EV plans laid out when demand seemed much stronger than it turned out to be, but they are still aiming to attract new EV buyers. Ford said on Friday that to support EV sales, which were up 34.8% for the automaker in 2024, it would extend a program where EV buyers receive free chargers and installation at home through the end of March. U.S. sales of electric vehicles are expected to approach 1.3 million, or about 8% of all new vehicles purchased, Cox Automotive said. Buyers' willingness to go electric crept up slightly from 2023, when U.S. drivers bought 1.2 million EVs, making up 7.6% of all sales, Cox said. The Trump administration's plans would likely affect auto sales in 2025 and beyond if the incoming president makes good on plans to roll back President Joe Biden's EV policies, including a $7,500 consumer tax credit on some EVs, as well as increase tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. 'If you take true demand for the car and you eliminate the $7,500 benefit ... it's really going to change who wants them and how they buy them. So we're preparing for that,' Toyota's Christ said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-new-car-sales-hit-5-year-high-in-2024-helped-by-hybrids/7924097.html	2025-01-03T17:43:55-08:00	
US announces $306 million in new bird flu funding	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's outgoing administration announced Friday that it will allocate $306 million to bolster the nation's bird flu response before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The new funding will support national, state and local preparedness and monitoring programs, as well as research into potential medical countermeasures against the H5N1 virus. 'While the risk to humans remains low, we are always preparing for any possible scenario that could arise,' Health Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. 'Preparedness is the key to keeping Americans healthy and our country safe.' The United States has reported 66 human cases of bird flu since the start of 2024, though experts believe the true number could be higher, with cases potentially going undetected among cattle and poultry workers. While the virus has not been found to spread from person to person, the amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists, because it might combine with seasonal influenza and mutate into a more transmissible form — potentially triggering a deadly pandemic. The funding announcement comes amid concern over how the incoming Trump administration will handle the threat. The president-elect told Time magazine recently he would abolish the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy established under Biden — though it is not clear if he has the authority to do so, since it was created by Congress. His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a vocal vaccine skeptic who has pledged to shake up the nation's health agencies and promotes raw milk, thought to be a vector for bird flu. Biden's administration has also faced criticism for what some consider a subpar bird flu response. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, published a report last month citing an array of problems including 'lagging data, incomplete surveillance, sluggish coordination, considerable mistrust, and insufficient planning and stockpiling of vaccines and therapies.' Given these shortcomings, infectious disease epidemiologist Meg Schaeffer of the SAS Institute told AFP: 'In my opinion, avian influenza is going to become either a pandemic or a virus... that will become a very widespread and significant health issue for us in the next one to two years.' She urged raw milk consumers in particular to 'take a pause on that consumption.' Adding to concerns, a virus sample from a critically ill patient in Louisiana has shown signs of mutating to better adapt to human airways, although there is no evidence it has spread beyond that individual, health authorities said last week. Researchers are also closely monitoring the growing number of bird flu infections in cats, which could expose humans through close contact.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-306-million-in-new-bird-flu-funding/7924091.html	2025-01-03T17:31:54-08:00	
Biden's top aide to make China-focused visit to India	washington — President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will make his final visit to India next week to emphasize Washington's partnership with New Delhi, the White House announced Friday. The visit will cap the Biden administration's efforts to maximize ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, in its strategic focus to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Strengthening ties with India has been a 'real foreign policy priority and area of legacy achievement for the Biden administration,' a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters Friday. Sullivan will visit New Delhi January 5-6 to discuss a range of issues, including civil nuclear partnership, China's overcapacity on semiconductor and biopharma supply chains, strategic technology cooperation and other shared security priorities, a second administration official said. Sullivan's visit comes as tension is brewing between India and China over Beijing's plan to build what it calls the 'world's largest' hydro dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, which could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh. Sullivan is expected to discuss the dam along with other regional issues of concern, said the first administration official in response to VOA's question. 'What matters to us is that when it comes to water resources that have to be managed across countries, that those are being handled fairly and in an equitable way,' the official said. Technology initiative A key focus of the visit is the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) – an effort that Biden and Modi announced in May 2022 to bolster their strategic technology partnership and defense-industrial cooperation between their governments, businesses and academic institutions across various domains, from AI to quantum computing, and from semiconductors to space. Sullivan's visit will take place just two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office January 20. Many expect iCET to continue under his administration. 'There is broad bipartisan support for some of the goals of iCET,' said the second administration official in response to VOA's question. They include 'strengthening the resilience of technology supply chains, working with allies and partners to position ourselves to offset PRC [People Republic of China's] advancements in certain technologies, and efforts to dominate some of the supply chains.' The U.S. strategic partnership with New Delhi is 'based upon a bet that India's economic, technological and military rise is critical to pushing back and containing China's dominance in these fields,' said Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute. Irritants have not derailed bilateral ties. Those include India's democratic backsliding, and the case of a former Indian government employee charged in New York last year with murder-for-hire over his role in directing a foiled plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist and Modi critic. Most of Biden's policies on India will likely continue, Pande told VOA, as Trump's desire to 'push back or contain China's rise – economic, technological and military – will help ensure that India is seen as a partner in this endeavor.' During his first administration, Trump had a warm relationship with Modi. Trump attended a 2019 'Howdy Modi' rally in Texas, and Modi reciprocated by hosting a 'Namaste Trump' rally in Ahmedabad in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-s-top-aide-to-make-china-focused-visit-to-india-/7924089.html	2025-01-03T17:31:51-08:00	
Iranians react to Carter's death with much criticism, little praise	washington — Iranians opposed to their nation's Islamist rulers who seized power during the U.S. presidency of Jimmy Carter have reacted to his death at age 100 with a wave of criticism about his enduring impact on Iran and some supportive views of his post-presidential activities. On the Monday edition of VOA Persian's 'On the Line' live audience call-in show, all 12 audience members whose phone calls, video and voice messages were featured in the program criticized Carter, accusing him of enabling the Islamic Republic's first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to seize power in 1979. Eleven of the 12 audience members who commented for the Persian-language show were calling from Iran, while the other audience member was in the U.S. Khomeini and his radical Shiite followers toppled the monarchy of Iran's U.S.-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, on Feb. 11, 1979. Pahlavi had fled into exile the previous month and arrived in the United States on Oct. 22, 1979, for cancer treatment that Carter approved. Islamist militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, taking 66 Americans hostage. Thirteen were released weeks later but the remaining 53 Americans were held through the rest of Carter's presidency. Iran freed them after 444 days, upon the Jan. 20, 1981, inauguration of Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan. Betrayal The Iranian callers to the VOA Persian show unanimously expressed the view that Carter betrayed the shah by abandoning him as he faced a growing Islamist rebellion and not doing enough to stop Iran from being plunged into a dark era with its people enduring hardship under 45 years of authoritarian Islamist rule. After leaving office, Carter said he tried to balance strategic and humanitarian considerations in his relationship with and treatment of the shah. Prominent U.S.-based Iranian supporters of Iran's exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, also used the X platform to post sharply critical views of Carter's legacy. Journalist Behnam Amini wrote in Persian: 'The man responsible for the misery of the Iranian nation has died. Soon, the downfall of the regime that he nurtured will come as well.' Also writing in Persian, monarchist Saman Sarraf described Carter as the 'founder of the Islamic Republic' and said: 'With Carter's death, the Islamic regime is on the brink of collapse.' Reza Pahlavi and his mother, exiled queen Farah Pahlavi, have been silent on Carter's death. The exiled crown prince's office did not immediately respond to a VOA request for comment sent Friday. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a U.S. nonprofit critical of the Pahlavi dynasty whose mission is to 'advance peace and diplomacy, secure equitable immigration policies and protect the civil rights of all Americans,' sent VOA a different view of Carter's role in Iran's Islamic Revolution. In a Friday statement, NIAC President Jamal Abdi said, 'It is important to understand that the 1979 [Islamic] Revolution was made and led by Iranians, not by the United States. In fact, U.S. support for the shah, despite his brutality toward protesters and torture of political opponents, was one of the triggers for popular protest.' Abdi also wrote that members of the Iranian American community admire Carter's efforts after his presidency to advance Middle East peace and to warn about the direction of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 'President Carter's legacy is multi-layered and complex, and not one that neatly fits the worldviews of his most animated detractors,' Abdi wrote. Exiled Iranian journalist Akbar Ganji, also a critic of the Pahlavi dynasty, offered praise for Carter in a Persian-language post on X, calling him a 'lifelong advocate for human rights around the world' in his post-presidency activities. This article was produced in collaboration with VOA's Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranians-react-to-carter-s-death-with-much-criticism-little-praise-/7924083.html	2025-01-03T17:18:25-08:00	
Central American troops arrive in Haiti to fight gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A contingent of security forces from Guatemala and El Salvador arrived in Haiti's capital Friday to reinforce a long-delayed United Nations-backed mission tasked with restoring security amid a bloody conflict with armed gangs. The new arrivals were made up of 75 Guatemalans and eight Salvadorans, a communications officer for the mission said. The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council, Leslie Voltaire, alongside Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime and U.S. Ambassador Dennis Hankins, welcomed the troops at Port-au-Prince's airport, Haiti's interim government said in a post on social media. 'They have come to reinforce the Multinational Force in the fight against gangsters and guns in the country,' the government said. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo had in September pledged to send 150 military police, three months after initially pledging in a letter to the U.N. an unnumbered contingent alongside personal equipment. El Salvador had in August promised 78 soldiers for medical evacuation operations as well as three helicopters — much needed by Haitian security forces contending with mountainous terrain and highways scattered with gang-controlled checkpoints. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has garnered broad popularity over a harsh crackdown on organized crime in his home country including the use of mass trials and construction of a 'mega-jail,' has stated that he would be able to 'fix' Haiti and that its gangs must be 'obliterated.' The mission is being led by Kenya, which deployed nearly 400 police in the middle of last year, far short of the 1,000 it had promised. The police were later joined by 24 Jamaican personnel and two senior officers from Belize. However, the mission has failed to prevent gangs from taking new territories and committing several massacres as violence dramatically escalated in the last months of 2024, causing thousands more people to flee their homes. Haiti's national police have meanwhile shed thousands of officers in recent years. Some 10 countries have together pledged over 3,100 troops for Haiti, but few have so far deployed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-american-troops-arrive-in-haiti-to-fight-gangs/7924084.html	2025-01-03T17:15:41-08:00	
Soldier who died in Las Vegas blast meant it to be 'wake-up call' for US	An Army soldier who died in an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas left a note saying it was a stunt to serve as a 'wake-up call' for the country's ills, investigators said Friday. Matthew Livelsberger, 37, a Green Beret from Colorado Springs, Colorado, also wrote in the note that he needed to 'cleanse my mind' of the lives lost of people he knew and 'the burden of the lives I took.' Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials said. 'Although this incident is more public and more sensational than usual, it ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other issues,' Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news conference. The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the hotel. Authorities said Friday that Livelsberger acted alone. 'Not a terrorist attack' 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake-up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives,' Livelsberger wrote in a letter found by authorities who released only excerpts of it. Investigators identified the Tesla driver — who was burned beyond recognition — as Livelsberger by a tattoo and by comparing DNA from relatives. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, according to coroner's officials. Pentagon officials have declined to say whether Livelsberger may have been suffering from mental health issues but say they have turned over his medical records to police. Authorities excerpted the messages from two letters Livelsberger wrote using a cellphone note application, said Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas police. The letters covered a range of topics including political grievances, domestic issues and societal issues, Koren said. Tesla engineers, meanwhile, helped extract data from the Cybertruck for investigators, including Livelsberger's path between charging stations from Colorado through New Mexico and Arizona and on to Las Vegas, Koren said. 'We still have a large volume of data to go through,' Koren said. 'There's thousands if not millions of videos and photos and documents and web history and all of those things that need to be analyzed.' The new details came as investigators sought to determine Livelsberger's motive, including whether he sought to make a political point with the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect's name. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has recently become a member of Trump's inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday, the day of the explosion. Both had attended Trump's New Year's Eve party at his South Florida estate. Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, who has named Musk, the world's richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government's size and spending. Truck absorbed blast Investigators suspect Livelsberger may have been planning a more damaging attack, but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built explosive. Investigators said previously that Livelsberger shot himself inside the Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks just before it exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day. 'It's not lost on us that it's in front of the Trump building, that it's a Tesla vehicle, but we don't have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology,' the FBI’s Evans said Thursday. A law enforcement official said investigators learned through interviews that he might have had a fight with his wife about relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla in Colorado on Saturday and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the investigation. Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. He had recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official. He was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. The explosion of the truck came hours after Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42, rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldier-who-died-in-las-vegas-blast-meant-it-to-be-wake-up-call-for-us/7924075.html	2025-01-03T16:50:55-08:00	
Biden awards Medal of Honor and Medal of Valor to military heroes, first responders	WASHINGTON — On Feb. 15, 1951, Army Private Bruno R. Orig was returning from a mission when he found his fellow soldiers under attack in what's now known as the Battle of Chipyong-ni. The infantryman provided first aid to his comrades wounded in the Korean War attack and began helping move those men to safety. He then took over a machine gun post and allowed a friendly platoon to pull back without a casualty. When the ground was recaptured later that day, Orig was found dead beside the machine gun, surrounded by enemy combatants he had killed. Orig was among the Medal of Honor recipients recognized Friday by President Joe Biden in one of his last opportunities to officially acknowledge acts of selflessness and personal bravery in times of war. Biden bestowed the medal posthumously to six men and one living recipient at a White House ceremony. In a separate Oval Office ceremony closed to the news media, he awarded the Medal of Valor to eight first responders who put their own lives at risk to save others. These are heroes of different ranks, different positions and even different generations.' Biden said at the Medal of Honor ceremony, Friday evening. 'They are heroes who all went above and beyond the call of duty.' Acknowledging his last days as president, Biden said, 'These are my finals days as commander in chief. It was the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted' to lead America, he said 'and the finest military in the history of the world.' During the Korean War, Private First Class Wataru Nakamura destroyed an enemy machine gun nest and recaptured several bunkers. He exhausted his ammunition but resumed his attack after being rearmed, and he was ultimately killed by an enemy grenade and buried in Los Angeles. Army Corporal Fred B. McGee was recognized for his gallantry and intrepidity near Tang-Wan-Ni, Korea, on June 16, 1952, when he assumed command of his squad, neutralized an enemy machine gun and then sent his squad back while he helped rescue the wounded. The Ohio native died in 2020, according to news reports. Army Private First Class Charles R. Johnson, from Millbrook, New York, was killed on June 12, 1953, after holding off Chinese forces during the Korean War. His actions saved the lives of as many as 10 soldiers. After multiple raids on an entrenched enemy in the area of Sagimak during the Korean War, Army First Lieutenant Richard E. Cavazos stayed behind alone to evacuate five battle casualties to safety. Cavazos served more than three decades in the service, eventually attaining the rank of four-star general. The Texan died in 2018 at age 88. Fort Hood was renamed in honor of him on May 9, 2023. After an armed helicopter crashed during the Vietnam War on June 5, 1966, Army Captain Hugh R. Nelson Jr. from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, pulled two specialists from the aircraft, shielding one of them from enemy gunfire at the loss of his own life. While fighting in Vietnam on May 7, 1970, then-Army Private First Class Kenneth J. David drew enemy fire away from injured comrades and onto himself, becoming wounded by a satchel charge. But David kept fighting and pulled fire away from landing Medevac helicopters, and was evacuated after the last helicopter landed. The Ohioan is still living. On Friday, Biden also awarded eight people the Medal of Valor, which goes to those who have shown exceptional courage in attempting to save human lives. The recipients included the law enforcement officials who responded to a shooter who killed six people on March 27, 2023, at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville Police Department's Sergeant Jeffrey Mathes, Officer Rex Engelbert and detectives Michael Collazo, Ryan Cagle and Zachary Plese rushed to the scene and faced gunfire from the shooter. They cleared out classrooms and ultimately took down the shooter. Biden also recognized Sergeant Tu Tran of the Lincoln, Nebraska, Police Department. On Feb. 22, 2023, Tran swam 9 meters (30 feet) into a frigid pond to rescue a woman from a submerging vehicle. Lieutenant John Vanderstar, a New York City firefighter, received the Medal of Valor for rescuing a mother and child from a burning apartment on Oct. 23, 2022. Separately, New York City firefighter Brendan Gaffney was honored for braving an apartment building fire to save an unconscious child and a pregnant woman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-awards-medal-of-honor-and-medal-of-valor-to-military-heroes-first-responders-/7924074.html	2025-01-03T16:42:26-08:00	
Winter storms to hit much of US with snow, ice, biting cold	A strong snow and ice storm followed by brutally cold conditions will soon smack the eastern two-thirds of the United States as frigid air escapes the Arctic, plunging as far south as Florida, meteorologists said. Starting Saturday, millions of people are going to be hit by moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington — including a high chance of at least 8 inches of snow between central Kansas and Indiana — the National Weather Service warned Friday. Dangerous ice particularly lethal to power lines — 'so heavy like paste, it's hard to move,' said private meteorologist Ryan Maue — is likely to set in just south of that in southern Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and much of Kentucky and West Virginia. 'It's going to be a mess, a potential disaster,' Maue said. 'This is something we haven't seen in quite a while.' National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Lamers said Friday that the potential for blizzard conditions was increasing, particularly in Kansas and neighboring portions of the Central Plains, and that wind gusts might reach 50 mph at times. As the storm moves away Monday, hundreds of millions of people in the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be plunged into dangerous, bone-chilling air and wind chills all week, government and private forecasters said. Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) colder than normal as the dreaded polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic, bringing chilly weather, they said. 'This could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,' Dan DePodwin, director of forecast operations for AccuWeather, said Friday. 'It’s not just one day of this. It's going to be three to five, in some cases a week or more of temperatures that are well below historical average.' Look out, Ohio Valley The biggest drop below normal is likely to be centered over the Ohio Valley, but significant unusual cold will extend southward all the way to the Gulf Coast, said Danny Barandiaran, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center. Forecasts have moderated a bit from last week, when some computer models envisioned the worst cold spell in decades. Now it's unlikely many cold records will break, but it will still have a big impact on the country, Barandiaran said. There should even be a hard freeze in Florida, while areas near the Canadian border will be around zero, Barandiaran said. 'It’s not going to thaw out for a while,' Maue said. Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Institute, said the initial blasting winds from the north might shock people after a fairly warm last couple of years. 'The wind chills are going to be brutal,' she said. 'There’ll be a lot of whining, but it is winter. ... Just because the globe is warming doesn’t mean these cold snaps are going away.' This nasty weather may be triggered in part by a fast-warming Arctic, serving as a not-so-gentle reminder that climate change gooses weather extremes, even winter ones, said Francis and Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. The polar vortex - ultra-cold air spinning like a top 15 to 30 miles high - usually stays penned up above the North Pole. But sometimes it escapes or stretches down to the United States, Europe or Asia. And that's when large numbers of people get intense doses of cold. Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen, Francis and others last month published a study that attributed these cold outbreaks partly to changes from an Arctic that’s warming four times faster than the rest of the globe. The change in temperature and loss of Arctic sea ice make the jet stream — the river of air that moves storm fronts — wavier, allowing plunges of cold air to come south and extreme weather to stay put, Francis said. What's about to hit 'is a really good example of these kinds of cases,' Francis said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-storms-to-hit-much-of-us-with-snow-ice-biting-cold/7923866.html	2025-01-03T16:10:36-08:00

Ukraine Defense Contact Group to hold one last meeting	U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will attend his final meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany next week, the Defense Department said Friday. The group of more than 50 nations, also known as the Ramstein group, includes members of NATO as well as most of the European Union. It was formed by Austin in April 2022, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two months earlier, and is designed to coordinate military support for Ukraine’s defense. The meeting, originally scheduled for October, was postponed when U.S. President Joe Biden — who had been scheduled to chair a leaders-level meeting for the group — canceled his trip to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, according to Politico. The last full meeting of the group was held in September. The meeting will come just over a week before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. The futures of the Ramstein group and any U.S. support to Ukraine are in question, as Trump has been critical of the level of U.S. aid to the country. He also has expressed an interest in ending the fighting swiftly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Trump could be important in the outcome of the yearslong war between Ukraine and Russia. 'Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,' Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television. 'His qualities are indeed there,' Zelenskyy said about Trump. 'He can be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.' Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that. Meanwhile, Agence France-Presse reported, citing local officials, that a Russian drone attack in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, early Friday killed one person and wounded four. AFP said Russian forces have escalated their aerial strikes across Ukraine through the first weeks of winter, including a New Year's Day drone attack targeting central Kyiv that killed two. In a statement posted to Facebook and other social media accounts, acting Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported a truck driver had been killed when he was hit by debris from a Russian drone that had been shot down. Also Friday, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces reported that Russian troops were continuing to push forward in Donetsk Oblast, advancing near the key town of Pokrovsk. Ukraine's General Staff recorded 138 clashes on the battlefield from Thursday to Friday. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-defense-contact-group-to-hold-one-last-meeting/7923847.html	2025-01-03T15:18:25-08:00

Seasonal illnesses in full force in most US states, CDC says	The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data. 'A lot of flu out there,' said Carrie Reed of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flulike symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of coldlike symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly. Reed said that the most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added. Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but 'influenza has now joined the party,' said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious-diseases specialist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. 'Now we're really starting to roll,' he added. 'Our hospitals are busy.' Where flu illnesses are the highest One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor's office visits driven by flulike symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter's respiratory virus season — which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses. Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and West. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England. So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations and 2,700 deaths, including at least 11 children. It's not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said. How to protect yourself U.S. health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it's not too late to get a shot. You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick. The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December. Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week. The cases are 'fairly sporadic,' and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seasonal-illnesses-in-full-force-in-most-us-states-cdc-says/7923841.html	2025-01-03T15:05:30-08:00

Myanmar's new cybercrime law will suppress information, say analysts	WASHINGTON — Myanmar's military leaders have enacted a new cybersecurity law that analysts say will provide the junta with extensive control over access to information. The expansive law — which has 16 chapters and 88 articles — includes regulations on Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, which allow internet users to circumvent website blocks. It penalizes users who access or share media articles and information from banned websites. The military council has said that the law is needed to protect against cyberattacks and cybercrimes that could threaten the country's stability. Among the regulations is a ban on the creation of illegal online gambling sites, which have been linked to organized crime. But an expert with the digital rights group Myanmar Internet Project, who asked to be identified only as U Han, said the law is more focused on suppressing rights than protecting the public. 'All the provisions of the law are designed to suppress rather than protect the public,' Han told VOA Burmese. 'We believe that junta will use this bill as a weapon prepared for this purpose.' The law will harm 'cyber freedom, digital freedom, and the right to use the internet, which are among the most fundamental of our human rights,' said Han. By suppressing these rights, Myanmar 'will be violating other basic human rights, socio-economic rights, such as education, business rights and religious rights,' he said. The law includes penalties for noncompliance, including warnings, fines and suspensions. It has the power to blacklist digital platform service providers who fail to prevent, remove or cease circulation of content deemed by the junta as 'disinformation' or 'rumors' that could damage unity or stability. Digital platform service providers are now required to collect the names and data of their users for up to three years, and to disclose those details to the authorities. The law additionally includes penalties for anyone found to have read, stored or shared articles from media outlets or groups banned or labeled as terrorists by the military council; gives the authorities power to shutter online services for reasons of security of the 'public good'; and allows for action to be taken against Myanmar citizens outside of the country's borders. One of the biggest criticisms from digital rights experts is the regulations around VPN use. Since the junta seized power in a military coup in February 2021, it has sought to control the flow of information. Dozens of journalists have been detained, broadcasting licenses revoked and websites blocked. Because of that, many residents use VPNs to access social media and media websites, or even to study. But under the new law, those users could face up to six months in prison and fines for using banned VPN services. A lawyer based in one of Myanmar's largest cities said the new law will make it harder for the public to access information. The lawyer, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, said that after thoroughly reading the full law, he sees no clear and concise provision. 'It seems that it has been written to be used as needed and that it has been written with the primary focus on those who will use [a] cyber platform,' the lawyer said. Myanmar in May of last year expanded blocks on websites, digital platforms and VPNs. According to Freedom House, the action specifically limited users to being able to access only about 1,500 preapproved websites. 'Internet freedom in Myanmar consequently declined, leaving it tied with China as the worst-surveyed country,' Freedom House said in November. Citing leaked documents, the activist group Justice for Myanmar reported in June that the enhanced censorship system uses technology from a Chinese network security company to block VPNs. The technology allows authorities to create a list of all known VPN domains and IP addresses they want blocked. 'Instead of just attacking the media, which they've done until now, [the junta are] actually attacking the ways that the general public can communicate and can access information,' Oliver Spencer, an expert on free expression in Myanmar, told VOA last year. Myanmar scores poorly on world rankings for digital rights and media freedom. Freedom House lists it as 'not free' for both global and internet freedoms, and the country ranks 171 out of 180, where 1 shows the best environment, on the World Press Freedom Index. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-s-new-cybercrime-law-will-suppress-information-say-analysts/7923821.html	2025-01-03T14:42:01-08:00	
Judge sets Trump's sentencing in hush money case for Jan. 10	NEW YORK — In an extraordinary turn, a judge Friday set President-elect Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for Jan. 10 — just 10 days before he's due to return to the White House — but indicated he wouldn't be jailed. The development nevertheless leaves Trump on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump’s trial, signaled in a written decision that he'd sentence the former and future president to what's known as a conditional discharge, in which a case is closed without jail time, a fine or probation. Merchan rejected Trump’s push to dismiss the verdict and throw out the case on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending return to the White House. The judge said he found 'no legal impediment to sentencing' Trump and that it was 'incumbent' on him to sentence Trump prior to his swearing in on Jan. 20. 'Only by bringing finality to this matter' will the interests of justice be served, Merchan wrote. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. After Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case. Trump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional 'disruptions' to the incoming president’s ability to run the country. Prosecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insisted the conviction should stand. They suggested various options, such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases. Merchan ruled that Trump’s current status as president-elect does not afford him the same kind of immunity granted to a sitting president and does not require that the verdict be set aside, and the case dismissed — a notion the judge described as 'drastic' and 'rare.' Doing that 'would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways,' Merchan wrote. He opined that it wouldn't address the Supreme Court's concerns about presidential immunity, either. Trump takes office Jan. 20 as the first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office. His conviction left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels’ payment. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself. Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign. Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family, not to influence the electorate. Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Trump, a Republican, has decried the verdict as the 'rigged, disgraceful' result of a 'witch hunt' pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. Before Trump’s November election, his lawyers sought to reverse his conviction for a different reason: a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July that gave presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution. That request was still pending when the election raised new issues. While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also sought to move the case to federal court, where he could also assert immunity. A federal judge repeatedly said no, but Trump appealed. The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial. Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases. One pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss; the other alleged he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate, state-level election interference case in Georgia is largely on hold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-sets-trump-s-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-for-jan-10/7923804.html	2025-01-03T14:18:56-08:00	
US capital in 'heightened threat environment' after New Year's Day attacks	washington — Law enforcement and security agencies in and around Washington are bringing in reinforcements as they prepare to secure three high-profile events in the nation's capital, following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck bombing in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The first event will occur Monday, when Congress meets to certify results of the presidential election four years to the day since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The second will be the state funeral for the late President Jimmy Carter, starting with a ceremony and procession on Tuesday before wrapping up on Thursday. The last high-profile event will come Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. 'That has never happened before. We have three [National Special Security Events] over a 15-day period,' Matt McCool, U.S. Secret Service Washington Field Office special agent in charge, told reporters Friday. 'But what I will tell you is we're flexible. We're adaptable. We've been working on these events for, in some cases, years,' he said. 'So, we're going to be prepared.' Despite concerns stemming from the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas bombing, security officials are confident so far that the Washington events will proceed safely. 'We are not tracking any credible or specific threats associated with these events,' said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge at the FBI's Washington Field Office. The law enforcement and security agencies, however, are not taking any chances, acknowledging that the city and the region are operating in a heightened threat environment. The Secret Service said Friday that it was bringing in agents from across the country to boost staffing levels, which were already the highest they have been in three years. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said it has added to its ranks almost 4,000 officers from departments across the country. The capital's National Guard Bureau confirmed it also has approved requests for additional support, including the provision of 500 guardsmen for the Jan. 6 election certification and liaison officers for the state funeral. An additional request for 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen to assist with security for the Trump inauguration is pending. Increased security measures, including barriers and fencing, are already up in parts of Washington and around the Capitol, but more are coming. 'A multitude of seen and unseen security measures will operate in tandem to ensure a comprehensive and seamless security plan comes to fruition,' McCool said, adding that the measures will include the use of aerial drones. 'The Secret Service will use drones as part of our comprehensive security plan,' McCool said. 'Do not be alarmed if you see these assets during the upcoming events or training in the days ahead.' The Metropolitan Police Department said its increased security measures would go into effect starting Sunday, with the deployment of specialized officers around the city to respond to any emergencies. The U.S. Capitol Police, whose 2,400 officers and civilian employees are responsible for protecting the Capitol and members of Congress, also said they were more prepared to handle contingencies than they were four years ago, when rioters upset with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee and injuring police officers. About 1,560 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot. So far, about 979 have pleaded guilty, while another 210 have been convicted. 'Our nation's capital is prepared to ensure that the legislative process will proceed without disruption, and our government will have a peaceful transfer of power,' said Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, noting that the force has implemented more than 100 recommendations made following the 2021 riot. Officials in Washington are also bracing for potential protests, saying several planned demonstrations have already gotten required permits. 'We are committed to upholding the right to peacefully assemble and protest here in our city,' said Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith. 'We welcome visitors to come and experience what this incredible city has to offer, but those who are intentional on unlawful activity should know that there will be consequences,' Smith said. 'However, as I've stated before, when we have special events, and I want to be very clear, that we will not tolerate any violence, rioting, destruction of property, or any behavior that threatens the safety and security of our city.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-capital-in-heightened-threat-environment-after-new-year-s-day-attacks-/7923765.html	2025-01-03T13:40:06-08:00	
Analysts: South Korea's political turmoil works in China's favor	WASHINGTON — South Korea’s political turmoil is deepening since its martial law debacle, and analysts say China may have an opportunity to increase its leverage over the country. The current political chaos in Seoul is 'working to[ward] Beijing’s advantage,' said Evans Revere, who served as the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. 'China, with its authoritarian approach to governing, is beneficiary' and 'no doubt pleased because China sees the ascendancy of the Democratic Party, known for its sympathetic approach to the PRC, as a positive development,' Revere said. China’s official name is the People’s Republic of China, or PRC. South Korea is embroiled in a deep political crisis with impeachments of the country’s leaders last month. This week, a standoff with security forces outside the Seoul residence of President Yoon Suk Yeol prevented investigators from an anti-corruption agency from detaining him. The main opposition Democratic Party, DP, urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon after expressing regret over the withdrawal of the investigators. The DP made two successive impeachments in two weeks last month. After impeaching Yoon on Dec. 14 over his failed attempt to impose martial law, the DP also succeeded in its push to impeach acting President Han Duk-soo the following week. The fate of Yoon, who was suspended from his duties, rests in the Constitutional Court. If the court rules in favor of impeaching Yoon, the country will hold an election, and Lee Jae-myung, the head of the DP, is considered a strong candidate. 'China would welcome a DP government in Seoul since the new administration would be conciliatory toward Beijing and Pyongyang and more antagonistic toward Washington and Seoul,' said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow of Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation. 'China could seek to drive wedges between South Korea and the U.S. by adopting a friendlier tone toward Seoul,' Klingner added. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Tuesday that 'China noted relevant events' but 'will not comment on the ROK’s domestic affairs,' referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea, or ROK. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, in a Dec. 24 phone conversation that 'China adheres to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.' He said joint efforts on both sides have led to improved bilateral relations. However, Klingner, in his report published just prior to South Korea’s general election last April, said China may find it beneficial to stir up resistance within South Korea to Yoon’s policies. Beijing, using its United Front Work Department, 'manipulates foreign public policy debates' by 'intensifying political differences within target countries, and inflating public support for a politician or party,' the report says. Leaning toward China The DP is 'very pro-China' and would 'reorient the country toward China' if it takes the control of the government,' said Gordan Chang, distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute and the author of Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America. 'It’s clear how South Korea’s policies would change' as demonstrated by the DP’s attempt to have acting president Han approve the amendments to the Act on Testimony and Appraisal a few days after the opposition party voted to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14. The amendment, sponsored by the DP, obligates individuals, including industry leaders, to attend hearings if asked and bans them from withholding information even if doing so would reveal trade secrets that might be sensitive to national security. It would 'force South Korean companies to divulge their trade secrets, which certainly would benefit China' and 'certainly undermine South Korean businesses,' said Chang. 'If South Korea loses its competitive edge, which is what the DP is trying to do, then it would be very easy for it to end South Korea’s democracy.' A nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Research Service report released on Dec. 23 underscores that the DP 'tends to advocate starkly different policies' than Yoon. The report also mentions that Lee has questioned Yoon for having 'a greater willingness than prior ROK leaders to publicly criticize China’s actions.' Yoon on Thursday said in a written message to his supporters rallying outside his residence that he will 'fight until the end' against anti-state forces that put the country in 'danger.' He thanked them for defending South Korea’s 'liberal democracy and constitutional order.' The message, reportedly delivered via a third person to his supporters, was signed by Yoon and made available to South Korean media by his lawyers. Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, said, 'The DP may recalibrate Seoul’s position between Beijing and Washington slightly and find itself more reluctant to support policies which are seen as red lines for China, such as supporting Taiwan in a Taiwan Strait crisis.' He continued, 'But the DP also recognizes the importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, so I anticipate robust U.S.-ROK relations even under a DP government.' Lee on Dec. 23 met with U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Philip Goldberg in Seoul and expressed hope for the alliance to develop further on human rights and environmental issues. Goldberg also met with the ruling PPP. Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said, 'The U.S. will remain the priority relationship for the next Korean administration, regardless of whether it is progressive or conservative.' He continued that a positive result that can emerge from closer South Korea and China relations 'would be a greater cooperation from China in managing North Korea, especially if [President-elect Donald] Trump seeks to engage with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-south-korea-s-political-turmoil-works-in-china-s-favor-/7923757.html	2025-01-03T13:21:07-08:00

Johnson reelected House speaker as Republicans face challenges despite control of Congress, White House	washington — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson retained the speakership in a first-round ballot Friday, as the 119th Congress came into session. Johnson won 218 votes, just enough to keep his job. Both the House and the Senate enter the new session with Republicans in the majority, the party having taken control from Democrats in the Senate. In that chamber, Senator Mitch McConnell has stepped away from party leadership for the first time in 18 years. Senator John Thune already has been selected to replace him as majority leader. Senate Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority, well below the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. In the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 219-215 majority, Johnson’s position was believed to have been in jeopardy after his deal last month with Democrats to keep the government funded and open. It would have taken as few as two Republicans to vote against Johnson to put his speakership in jeopardy. Democrats nominated Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership but fell short by a few votes. President-elect Donald Trump posted his support for Johnson on social media Monday, saying the speaker was 'a good, hard-working, religious man.' But Republican Representatives Chip Roy and Thomas Massie had stated their doubts about Johnson's leadership, and Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon had called on Republicans to remove Johnson from leadership. 'Mr. Johnson caught a lot of fire from his GOP colleagues. And he has an extraordinarily limited margin for his majority, just a handful of people,' Kevin Kosar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA via Zoom. Two years ago, at the start of another Congress, Republican Kevin McCarthy faced similar challenges to his bid for the speakership. He was finally elected on the 15th round of voting. Had Johnson or another Republican been unable to garner enough votes for the speakership, the chamber could have been without a leader in time for the official certification of Trump’s electoral victory on January 6. At least temporarily, Republicans' margin in the House will be even tighter after Trump takes office on January 20, because he has picked two House Republicans to join his administration. Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new presidency and Congress are a time for pursuing an ambitious legislative agenda. Trump 'is going to hit tariffs very hard. He's going to focus on the border, and executive orders related to immigration and immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim countries. And then he's going to work on any compromises he can to get through the legislative agenda on things affecting the economy, groceries, as he likes to call it,' Casey Burgat, a professor at George Washington University in Washington, told VOA via Zoom. Some information for this story came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/johnson-reelected-house-speaker-as-republicans-face-challenges/7923704.html	2025-01-03T12:43:31-08:00	
M23 rebels edge closer to key town in east DR Congo	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Rwanda-backed M23 rebels moved closer Friday to a key town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, capturing a nearby area, sources told AFP. The March 23 Movement (M23), a militia supported by neighboring Rwanda and its army, has seized vast swathes of the eastern territory of the DRC since 2021, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. Angola-mediated talks between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame were abruptly canceled in mid-December over disagreements on the terms of a proposed peace deal. Sources told AFP Friday that the M23 had taken control of the Katale area — the last place the rebels must pass before entering Masisi, the administrative capital of the Masisi territory. 'We have been attacked by the rebels ... the enemy controls Katale,' a security source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. 'We confirm the capture of Katale by the M23 rebels, for the moment the population has fled towards Masisi center,' Thierry Muhindo, the head of a locality comprising Katale, told AFP. Telesphore Mitondeke, Masisi civil society president, told AFP that several deaths in clashes in the area had been reported among the population, although no figures are currently available. 'It is necessary to note the serious human damage ... it is revolting,' he said. Masisi is located around 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma. In late December, the rebels were continuing their latest offensive, launched just ahead of a planned summit in the Angolan capital that was supposed to return peace to the region. M23 forces were only around 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the town of Lubero and around 100 kilometers from the key commercial hub of Butembo. For 30 years, the DRC's mineral-rich east has suffered from the ravages of fighting between local and foreign armed groups, dating back to the regional wars of the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-edge-closer-to-key-town-in-east-dr-congo-/7923697.html	2025-01-03T12:33:32-08:00	
Hundreds rescued as South Korean firefighters tackle blaze in Seongnam	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Hundreds of people were rescued or evacuated after a fire broke out at a large commercial building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, fire officials said. More than 260 firefighters and 80 vehicles were deployed to the scene of the blaze, which was extinguished about an hour and a half after it was first reported at around 4:30 p.m., according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department. Earlier, YTN television reported that a number of people were trapped inside, with footage showing black smoke engulfing a large part of the building. The fire department said emergency workers have so far rescued 240 people, while another 70 managed to exit the eight-story building unaided. About 28 people sustained light injuries, including smoke inhalation, but there were no reports of serious injuries. The department said emergency workers were still searching the site to ensure no one was trapped inside. The department said the fire started at a restaurant on the first floor. The cause wasn’t immediately known. Some material for this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rescued-as-south-korean-firefighters-tackle-blaze-in-seongnam/7923672.html	2025-01-03T12:12:35-08:00	
Talks on new 3-party Austrian government collapse as one party leaves	VIENNA — Talks on forming a new three-party government in Austria collapsed Friday as the smallest of the prospective coalition partners pulled the plug on the negotiations. The talks had dragged on since Austria's president tasked conservative Chancellor Karl Nehammer in October with putting together a new government. That decision came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time. Nehammer has been trying to assemble a coalition of his Austrian People's Party with the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos party. Nehammer's party and the Social Democrats have governed Austria together in the past but have the barest possible majority in the parliament elected in September, with a combined 92 of the 183 seats. That was widely considered too small a cushion, and the two parties sought to bring in Neos. But Neos leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger said she informed Nehammer, Social Democratic leader Andreas Babler and President Alexander Van der Bellen early Friday that her party 'won't continue' talks on becoming a partner in a new government. She pointed to the implications of a 'budget hole' left by the last government as a major source of difficulty, adding that the election showed a desire for change, but the talks appeared to be going backward rather than forward in recent days. The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria’s economy is in decline with rising unemployment and continuing recession. 'There was a repeated ‘no’ to fundamental reforms this week,' Meinl-Reisinger told reporters in Vienna. Austrian People’s Party general secretary Christian Stocker blamed 'backward-looking forces' among the Social Democrats for prompting the collapse of the talks. Nehammer said in a post on social media Friday evening that he 'regretted' the decision by the Neos party to pull out of the coalition talks. He said that his party continues to be ready to 'assume responsibility,' and to implement reforms, especially in the areas of improving economic competitiveness and implementing a clear asylum and migration policy. 'The constructive forces of the political center are called upon to come along on this path with us now,' Nehammer said. It wasn't immediately clear how the situation could be resolved. The two bigger parties could potentially try to form a government alone or turn to the environmentalist Greens as a prospective third partner. Nehammer's often-tense two-party outgoing coalition with the Greens lost its parliamentary majority in the election, though it remains in office as a caretaker administration. The Freedom Party, which has seen its poll ratings rise since the election, called for Nehammer's resignation. The far-right party won the parliamentary election in September with 29.2% of the vote but both Nehammer and Babler excluded working with far-right leader Herbert Kickl. According to the latest opinion polls published in December, the Freedom Party increased its support to between 35% and 37%. Its general secretary, Michael Schnedlitz, accused the chancellor of refusing to accept his election defeat and said it had long warned against a three-way coalition 'on the German model' — a reference to the quarrelsome government in neighboring Germany that collapsed in November. Germany is holding an early election next month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/talks-on-new-3-party-austrian-government-collapse-as-one-party-leaves-/7923647.html	2025-01-03T12:03:17-08:00	
Montenegro to tackle gun control after mass killing left 12 dead	PODGORICA, Montenegro — A top-level meeting in Montenegro on Friday looked for ways to curb illegal weapons after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in a second such tragedy in less than three years in the small Balkan country. An emergency session of Montenegro's National Security Council is expected to call for a new gun law and urgent actions to confiscate what are believed to be abundant illegal weapons in possession of Montenegro's 620,000 citizens. The Adriatic Sea nation has a deeply rooted gun culture. State television broadcaster RTCG reported that Montenegro is sixth in the world when it comes to the number of illegal weapons per capita. The gunman who killed a dozen people in a shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday did so with an illegal 9 mm gun. Police have said they found 37 casings at the shooting locations, and more than 80 additional pieces of ammunition in the gunman's possession. The 45-year-old man, identified as Aco Martinović, eventually shot himself in the head and died shortly after. He is believed to have snapped after a bar brawl and went home to get his weapon before launching a bloody rampage at several locations late Wednesday afternoon. Martinović's victims included seven men, three women — among them his sister — and two children, born in 2011 and 2016. Four more people were seriously wounded and remain hospitalized. Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović has described Wednesday’s shooting as 'one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Montenegro.' The shooting has fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Hundreds of people throughout Montenegro lit candles in silence Thursday evening in memory of the victims, while also calling for answers as to why the shooting happened. Many were angry at the authorities for not doing more to prevent such tragedies and protests are being planned for the coming days. Mira Škorić, a retiree from Podgorica, said that 'I can’t believe that we failed so much as a society. We failed as people too.' In a separate massacre in August 2022, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. The shootings 'require a serious examination of the responsibility and preparedness of the security system,' the Human Rights Action and Women’s Rights Center groups said in a statement. 'What has changed in the security system in Cetinje since 2022?' Police have said that Martinović’s actions weren’t planned and were impossible to predict and prevent, though he had been convicted in the past of violent behavior and illegal weapons possession and had received psychiatric treatment. Vesna Pejović, a Cetinje resident who lost her daughter and two grandchildren in the shooting back in 2022, said police had to do more to protect the citizens after the first killing. 'What kind of state and system is this where children are getting killed? Are we at war?' she asked. 'Where were the police?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-to-tackle-gun-control-after-mass-killing-left-12-dead-/7923559.html	2025-01-03T11:14:39-08:00	
US law enforcement warned to watch for New Orleans copycat attacks	The U.S. Homeland Security Department and the FBI are warning federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to be vigilant for potential copycat incidents inspired by the New Year’s Eve truck-ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people. In a joint intelligence bulletin released Friday and obtained by VOA and other news organizations, federal authorities warned the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for 'potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe.' The bulletin said such attacks 'are likely to remain attractive for aspiring attackers given vehicles' ease of acquisition and the low skill threshold necessary to conduct an attack.' The federal bulletin noted that since 2014, the Islamic State terror group has been promoting the use of vehicles in terror attacks, followed by attacks with secondary weapons, as a method to cause mass casualty incidents. The joint bulletin advised law enforcement agencies to look for danger signs, such as fraudulent documents or credit cards used to rent vehicles, or signs of 'pre-operational surveillance,' such as automobiles parked in odd locations or suspicious activity near an event location. The FBI released three photos Friday of the now deceased suspect in the attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, taken from surveillance video about an hour before the deadly Bourbon Street attack. They also released a photograph of a blue ice chest that was found near the scene containing an improvised explosive device. The photos were released along with a statement soliciting information from any member of the public who might have passed Jabbar on the street or saw the cooler like the one in the photo. The White House announced Friday that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to New Orleans on Monday to visit with families and community members affected by the attack, as well as meet with officials on the ground. In a briefing Thursday with reporters, FBI officials said they believe Jabbar, who was killed at the scene in a shootout with police, acted alone in the New Year’s attack and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia, with the agency’s counterterrorism division, said they concluded Jabbar had no accomplices following hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls, social media accounts and electronic devices. Officials reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. The attack occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m. On Tuesday evening, just hours before the attack, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag also was found in the vehicle after the attack. 'This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,' Raia said. Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends but worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said. 'He was 100% inspired by ISIS.' The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the truck and shot at responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the driver, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, the police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and an explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with other explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' he said. In the same post, Trump also falsely suggested that the suspect was an immigrant. VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin and VOA reporter Liam Scott contributed to this report.

US surgeon general urges cancer warnings for alcoholic drinks	WASHINGTON/LONDON — Alcoholic drinks should carry a warning about cancer risks on their label, the U.S. surgeon general said Friday in a move that could signal a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said alcohol consumption increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon and liver cancer, but most U.S. consumers remain unaware of this. Murthy also called for the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits to be reassessed so that people can weigh the cancer risk when deciding whether or how much to drink. U.S. dietary guidelines currently recommend two or fewer drinks per day for men and one drink or less per day for women. 'Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity,' Murthy's office said in a statement accompanying the new report, adding the type of alcohol consumed does not matter. His advisory sent shares in alcohol companies including Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Anheuser-Busch and Heineken down, in some cases over 3%. Alcohol producers and industry associations did not immediately share comments. It is unclear when or if the surgeon general's suggestions will be adopted. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is entering its final two weeks. Murthy could be succeeded by Janette Nesheiwat, a director of a New York chain of urgent care clinics and President-elect Donald Trump's pick for the role. Trump, whose brother died from alcoholism and who does not drink himself, has long warned about the risks of drinking. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, has been open about his past struggles with heroin and alcohol, and says that he attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The decision to update the label will ultimately be made by Congress. Small print Murthy's advisory harks back to early U.S. surgeon general action on tobacco, starting with a 1964 report that concluded smoking could cause cancer. The report kicked off decades of increasingly strict regulations, starting with U.S. laws on warning labels one year later and still ongoing today. Alcoholic drinks in the U.S. already carry warnings on their packaging, including that drinking alcohol while pregnant can cause birth defects and that it can impair judgment when operating machinery. These appear in small print on the back of the packaging. This label has not changed since its inception in 1988. Murthy's recommendations call for an update to these existing labels, rather than new cigarette-style warnings that are today displayed prominently on the front of every packet. Analysts, however, pointed out that cigarette warning labels did little to curb smoking and ingrained habits are hard to change. 'Warning labels won't be an immediate deathblow to alcohol makers, but it will compound the long-term threats to the industry,' said Blake Droesch, analyst with eMarketer. In the U.S., among the largest markets for many western producers, companies face growing competition from alternatives like cannabis and the threat of lower volumes as some consumers, especially younger ones, drink less than previous generations. Beer makers especially have, however, enjoyed benefits from a shift toward healthier lifestyles, with low- or no-alcohol products enjoying rapid growth. Heineken's 0.0 version, for example, grew double digits in 16 markets last year. The advisory said alcohol is responsible for 100,000 U.S. cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths each year, more than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash deaths. The new report recommends health care providers should encourage alcohol screening and treatment referrals as needed, and efforts to increase general awareness should be expanded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-surgeon-general-urges-cancer-warnings-for-alcoholic-drinks/7923523.html	2025-01-03T10:34:01-08:00	
Iran summons Italian ambassador over arrest of Iranian wanted by US	DUBAI — Iran's foreign ministry summoned the Italian ambassador on Friday over the detention of an Iranian national wanted by the United States for his alleged role in a deadly drone strike against U.S. forces, Iranian state media reported. The summons came a day after a similar move by Italy over Iran's arrest of Italian reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on December 19 while working under a journalist visa. An Iranian foreign ministry official 'urged Italy to reject America's hostage policy — which is contrary to international law, particularly human rights — and provide for Mr. [Mohammad] Abedini's release as soon as possible and prevent damage to bilateral ties,' state media reported. On Thursday, the Iranian embassy in Rome said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary, and for the first time, linked her case to that of Abedini. Iran's said on Monday that Sala had been arrested for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic.' It gave no further information. Sala was detained three days after Abedini, an Iranian businessman, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack. Abedini is currently being held in prison and a court is due to decide this month whether to grant him house arrest while judges consider the U.S. extradition request. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies this.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-summons-italian-ambassador-over-arrest-of-iranian-wanted-by-us-/7923486.html	2025-01-03T10:31:43-08:00	
Cameroon officials say country's military seized weapons from terrorists re-arming Boko Haram	Yaounde — Cameroon’s military says it has seized several hundred weapons and combat uniforms that were being smuggled to a hideout of the Nigeria-based terrorist group Boko Haram. Officials say troops have been deployed in a bid to capture more weapons and prevent Boko Haram from re-arming itself. Moki Edwin Cameroon government officials say long-barreled firearms, military uniforms, over 400 packets of tear gas and more than 100 gallons of oxidizing agents were seized from suspected Boko Haram members this week in Maroua, a northern town near the central African country’s border with Nigeria and Chad. The military says the oxidizing agents are used by Boko Haram terrorists to produce explosives. The governor of Cameroon’s Far North region, Midjiyawa Bakari, says the weapons were being smuggled to Nigeria’s Sambisa forest, a Boko Haram stronghold. Bakari says he is very thankful to the Cameroon military for intercepting war weapons, combat uniforms and acids used to fabricate explosives destined for several Boko Haram groups in Sambisa, a forest which straddles the Nigeria-Cameroon border and is a hideout for members of the terror group. He says Boko Haram is rearming and recruiting members after it was weakened by troops of the Multinational National Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin or MNJTF. MNJTF is made up of 11,000 troops from Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Bakari told Cameroon state TV on Thursday that some of the weapons were smuggled through the Douala seaport. He did not say how the weapons got to Douala but said investigations have been opened to trace the origin of the weapons. Cameroon’s military says some of the combat uniforms seized are similar to those used by its infantry and air force. Boko Haram fighters sometimes disguise themselves as government troops to deceive civilians before attacking communities for supplies, officials say. The government says civilians should help prevent Boko Haram from re-arming and recruiting new members by reporting strangers in all border towns and villages to government troops. Chad’s president, Mahamat Idriss Deby, in his New Year’s message on Tuesday, said several hundred fighters escaped Chad to neighboring countries when his troops launched Operation Haskanite. The operation’s goal is to neutralize Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed more than 40 Chadian government troops in the Lake Chad Basin in October. Maki Jean Emmanuel is a researcher on conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and visiting lecturer at the University of N’djamena. He says no country in the Lake Chad basin can single-handedly defeat Boko Haram. Maki says MNJTF should be on alert because Boko Haram is infiltrating many villages where government troops do not have easy access and recruiting new members, especially poor and unemployed youths, is taking place. He says the porous nature of the borders between Cameroon, Nigeria and Chad makes it possible for arms to be smuggled to villages where Boko Haram fighters are hiding. Cameroon says several dozen people caught smuggling the weapons were arrested but has given no details on whether they are Cameroonians, Nigerians or Chadians. Over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and gradually spread to neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-officials-say-country-s-military-seized-weapons-from-terrorists-re-arming-boko-haram-/7923381.html	2025-01-03T09:14:45-08:00	
US issues cybersecurity sanctions against China's Integrity Technology	WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday issued fresh cybersecurity sanctions against Integrity Technology Group, a Chinese company involved in computer programming, a posting on the Treasury Department website showed. The Beijing-based company has previously been accused by Western officials of being behind a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed 'Flax Typhoon.' Speaking at a cybersecurity conference last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that Integrity Technology posed as an IT firm but also 'collected intelligence and performed reconnaissance for Chinese government security agencies.' At the time, Chinese officials accused the U.S. and its allies of having 'jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-issues-cybersecurity-sanctions-against-china-s-integrity-technology/7923351.html	2025-01-03T08:38:16-08:00	
South Sudan begins mass inoculation campaign with cholera vaccines	Juba, South Sudan — More than 1.1 million doses of an oral cholera vaccine have arrived in South Sudan, as the government launched a program to inoculate more than 80 percent of the population. But the mass vaccination exercise faces numerous challenges, including a lack of access to the areas dealing with the worst cholera outbreaks. Medics in South Sudan will attempt to vaccinate at least 9 million people against cholera, an exercise that targets mostly children and mothers. More than 1.1 million doses of oral cholera vaccine arrived in the capital, Juba, and will be dispatched next week to hot spots areas like the town of Bentiu. The country’s Ministry of Health reported last week that 199 people have died of cholera, with 13,000 more diagnosed so far with the bacteria. Dr. Gabriel Boum Tap is an immunization officer at UNICEF in South Sudan. 'Of course, we had also received some vaccines before; only that they were not enough, because, you know, it’s not like the cholera vaccine is manufactured and is put in one place already,' he said. At least one cholera case has been recorded in 29 of the 79 counties in South Sudan, with Bentiu, Renk and Juba most affected. The first case was reported on September 23 in Renk, northeast of the capital. But as the country prepares to roll out a mass vaccination exercise, the process faces some serious headwinds. Thinjin Khoat is one of the victims of the cholera outbreak. He says he has seen people die of the disease, with many more trooping to local health centers seeking urgent medical attention. 'I was at one of the health facilities, and there was a suspected case of cholera. The patient was a 5-year-old. The patient was vomiting, and in the process, the health workers couldn’t get the vein. The patient is not able to get the oral fluid. ... In that process, the patient died of dehydration,' he said. Cholera is an acute diarrhea infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water. If not treated, it can be fatal within hours. Khoat says accessibility to health care remains a major hindrance to the fight against the disease. 'Some of the community members, they don’t have access, because, you know, in Bentiu here, there is flooding. There are some areas that health workers cannot access because of the flood and also security issues,' he said. According to Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, poor living conditions in South Sudan have created the perfect breeding ground for cholera. Stephanie Ngai is MSF’s project coordinator for cholera response in Bentiu, located in Rubkona County, an area with a large refugee population. 'Here in Rubkona, the explosion on the outbreak very quickly overwhelmed the local systems that are responsible for coordinating the response and scaling up the interventions,' she said. 'Other partners don’t have adequate funding to properly scale up the level needed, which is massive. And the overall response coordination has not been strong enough to manage the response and ensure that the needs are adequately met.' The government says the vaccination exercise is expected to roll out next Monday with support from international partners such as MSF and the World Health Organization. Buok Danhier, the immunization program manager for the Unity State Ministry of Health, says the various entities will split up duties in Rubkona. 'Rubkona has many payams [local districts]. Most of the payams are affected by flooding, and these are the ones that will be taken by WHO — the hard-to-reach areas. WHO and other partners are pledging to cover all those areas that are hard to reach and also very far from town. Bentiu IDP, Rukona and Bentiu town — these areas will be covered by MSF, and the recruitment process is ongoing,' said Danhier. The vaccination exercise will target children 1 year and above. WHO says up to 143,000 people worldwide die from cholera each year out of an estimated 4 million annual cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-begins-mass-inoculation-campaign-with-cholera-vaccines-/7923116.html	2025-01-03T08:37:11-08:00

Israeli strikes kill at least 30 people in Central Gaza	Hospital workers say Israeli airstrikes killed at least 30 people in central Gaza late Thursday into Friday, adding to a death toll that reached at least 56 people over the past 24 hours. Staff at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press that more than a dozen women and children were killed in attacks that hit targets in Central Gaza, including Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah. Israeli attacks hit many of the same areas Thursday, bringing the death toll over the past 24 hours to at least 56, according to Palestinian health authorities. On the social media platform X, the Israel Defense Forces, IDF, said Friday that fighter jets and aircraft attacked about 40 Hamas 'terrorist concentration points and command and control complexes' throughout the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours in a joint operation of the Israeli Air Force and the IDF Southern Command. The IDF said dozens of Hamas terrorists operated from the compounds, some of which were established in spaces that previously were used as schools. 'This is another example of Hamas's cynical and systematic use of civilians and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip for terrorist purposes,' the IDF said. The Israeli military said it took many steps prior to the attacks to prevent harming civilians, 'including the use of precision weapons, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information.' The IDF also reported early Friday it intercepted a drone and shot down a missile, each launched from Yemen. From its X account, the IDF said the drone was intercepted before it crossed into Israeli territory, and that no alerts were activated. The statement said the missile was intercepted and shot down over south-central Israel, with fragments falling the area of Modi'in. No damage was reported, and the incident is under investigation, the statement said. On Wednesday, Israel warned it would intensify its strikes against Hamas if the militant group continued to hold the hostages it took in its October 7, 2023, terror attack and launches rockets at Israel. The latest attacks on Gaza come as an Israeli delegation reportedly is in Doha, to continue negotiations toward a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday he authorized the delegation from the country's intelligence services and military. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants’ October 7, 2023, terror attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 people as hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-at-least-30-people-in-central-gaza-/7923266.html	2025-01-03T07:21:44-08:00	
Ethiopia defense minister visits Somalia, in sign of detente	Nairobi — Ethiopia's defense minister traveled to Somalia on Thursday, a senior official in Mogadishu said, the first bilateral visit since relations nosedived a year ago over an Ethiopian plan to build a naval base in a breakaway Somali region. Somalia's state minister for foreign affairs, Ali Omar, confirmed Aisha Mohammed Mussa's visit in a message to Reuters but did not say what she was there to discuss. In a post Friday on social media platform X, Ethiopia's foreign affairs ministry said the two countries had 'agreed to collaborate on the #AUSSOM [African Union peacekeeping] mission and strengthen bilateral relations.' Ethiopia has up to 10,000 troops in Somalia to fight Islamist militants from al-Shabab, but Mogadishu has threatened to expel them if Addis Ababa did not renounce an agreement it reached a year ago with the breakaway Somaliland region. The preliminary deal called for Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for an Ethiopian naval base and commercial port in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland's independence. Somaliland has had effective autonomy since 1991, but its independence has not been recognized by any other country. Mogadishu considers it an integral part of its territory and called its deal with Ethiopia an act of aggression. After months of escalating rhetoric and inconclusive international mediation efforts, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed on December 11, after talks in Turkey, to work together to resolve the dispute and begin technical negotiations by the end of February. The Ethiopian troops in Somalia are there as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission and on a bilateral basis. Regional powers fear their withdrawal would severely weaken the fight against al-Shabab, an al-Qaida affiliate that has been waging an insurgency since 2007. The dispute also has raised concerns about wider instability in the Horn of Africa, with Somalia responding to the Somaliland deal by drawing closer to Ethiopia's traditional rivals Egypt and Eritrea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-defense-minister-visits-somalia-in-sign-of-detente-/7923213.html	2025-01-03T06:46:15-08:00	
Ghana's parliament passes provisional budget, averts government shutdown	Accra — Ghana's parliament has passed a provisional budget that allows the government to spend 68.1 billion Ghanaian cedis ($4.65 billion) through March, the chamber's speaker said, narrowly averting an unprecedented government shutdown. Parliamentary Speaker Alban Bagbin said the parliament had approved the provisional budget in a sitting that stretched deep into Thursday night. John Dramani Mahama is set to take office as the West African country's president next week after winning a December 7 election, staging a political comeback after serving as Ghana's president from 2012 to 2016. Outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo was due to present his last state of the nation address later on Friday after eight years leading the gold- and oil-exporting nation. A provisional budget is typically passed in November during election years to cover the gap until the president-elect takes office. But the presentation of the provisional budget had dragged this time after an impasse over whether the outgoing New Patriotic Party (NPP) or the incoming National Democratic Congress, NDC, party has a majority of seats in the House. Finance Minister Mohammed Amin Adam told the joint business and finance committees the late passage of the provisional budget would not affect government business. 'It averts a government shutdown and [the] likelihood of worsening Ghana's ongoing debt default saga,' Seth Terkper, a former finance minister, told Reuters. Almost a third of the approved amount is earmarked for payments to energy-sector service providers, according to the provisional budget. Mahama, the president-elect, said last month that Ghana was going to face a critical situation in the energy sector, adding that preliminary estimates showed that arrears exceeded $2.5 billion at a time when the power supply was erratic. Mahama, who contested the election as the main opposition leader, is returning to power amid an economic resurgence from Ghana’s worst crisis in a generation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-parliament-passes-provisional-budget-averts-government-shutdown/7923176.html	2025-01-03T06:17:35-08:00	
US blocks Nippon Steel's bid to purchase US Steel	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security. The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly $3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm. It also represents the final chapter in a high-profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal. The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned. The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, seen by Reuters, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects. But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up U.S. Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval. But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks, Reuters exclusively reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-blocks-nippon-steel-s-bid-to-purchase-us-steel-/7923134.html	2025-01-03T05:28:54-08:00	
Russian drone attack kills 1 in Kyiv suburbs	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack towards the Ukrainian capital on Friday killed one person and wounded four in the Kyiv suburbs, local officials said. Moscow's forces have escalated their aerial strikes across Ukraine through the first weeks of winter, including a New Year's Day drone attack targeting central Kyiv that killed two. 'One person killed and four wounded in enemy air attack on Kyiv region,' said Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv region, which surrounds the capital, said on social media on Friday. He said a truck driver had been killed after he was hit by falling debris from a Russian drone that had been shot down. Wreckage also fell on a house, wounding three -- including a 16-year-old boy and his father. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 93 drones overnight. It said 60 attack drones and 26 decoy-style drones were downed or 'lost' -- either shot down or disabled by electronic interceptors. Downed drones also fell on two districts of Kyiv, but there were no injuries, the city mayor said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-kills-1-in-kyiv-suburbs/7923007.html	2025-01-03T02:32:56-08:00	
French and German foreign ministers visit Syria	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The foreign ministers of France and Germany are headed to Damascus on the first official visit to Syria by top diplomats from European Union countries after the fall of former President Bashar Assad, in what the German minister said is a clear signal that a 'new beginning' between Europe and Syria is possible. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who began the visit Friday with a meeting with Christian religious leaders in Damascus, said in a statement on the social media platform X that the two countries 'want to promote a peaceful and urgent transition in the service of Syrians and for regional stability.' He and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock are expected to meet with Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the Islamist former insurgent group that is now the de facto ruling party in Syria. Baerbock said there can be a 'political new beginning between Europe and Syria' only if the new Syrian society gives all people, regardless of ethnic or religious group, 'a place in the political process' as well as rights and protection. She said those rights should not be undermined by an overly long transition to elections or by 'steps toward the Islamification of the justice or education system,' that there should be no acts of revenge against entire groups of the population, and that extremism should have no place. Since Assad’s ouster in a lightning offensive by opposition forces, Damascus has experienced a flurry of visits from Arab and Western countries that had cut off relations with Assad’s government during the country’s nearly 14-year civil war. However, Western countries have so far not lifted sanctions placed on Syria under Assad or removed the designation of HTS as a terrorist group, although the United States lifted a $10 million bounty it had previously placed on al-Sharaa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-and-german-foreign-ministers-visit-syria/7922980.html	2025-01-03T00:43:02-08:00	
Israel army says intercepted missile, drone launched from Yemen	JERUSALEM — Israel's military reported that it shot down a missile and a drone launched from Yemen on Friday, the latest in a series of attacks from the country targeting Israel in recent weeks. 'A missile that was launched from Yemen and crossed into Israeli territory was intercepted,' the military said in a statement posted to its Telegram channel. 'A report was received regarding shrapnel from the interception that fell in the area of Modi'in in central Israel. The details are under review.' Israel's emergency service provider, Magen David Adom, reported that it had treated several people who were injured or experienced panic attacks on their way to shelters after air raid sirens sounded in the center and south of the country. Hours later the military announced that it had also shot down a drone launched from Yemen. The drone was intercepted before it entered Israel, the military added. On Tuesday, Israel also said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Much of Yemen is controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have been firing missiles and drones at Israel -- as well as at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden -- in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have stepped up their attacks since November's ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has also struck Yemen, including targeting Sanaa's international airport at the end of December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-army-says-intercepted-missile-drone-launched-from-yemen/7922978.html	2025-01-03T00:34:46-08:00	
Republicans face challenges despite control of Congress, White House	WASHINGTON — The 119th U.S. Congress will come into session Friday. After a contentious government funding battle last month, though, Republican Party control of both houses of Congress and presidency faces challenges. The Senate enters the new session as Republicans take the majority from Democrats and Senator Mitch McConnell steps away from party leadership for the first time in 18 years. Republican Senator John Thune has already been selected to lead the Senate as majority leader. Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority, well below the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. In the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 219-215 majority, the focus will be on votes for speaker. Current Speaker Mike Johnson’s position is in jeopardy after his deal last month with Democrats to keep the government funded and open. It would take only as few as two Republicans to vote against Johnson to put his speakership in jeopardy. Democrats are expected to nominate Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership but are likely to fall short by a few votes. President-elect Donald Trump posted his support for Johnson on social media Monday, saying the speaker was 'a good, hard-working, religious man.' But Republican representatives Chip Roy and Thomas Massie have already stated their doubts about his leadership and Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon has called on Republicans to remove Johnson from leadership. 'Mr. Johnson caught a lot of fire from his GOP colleagues. And he has an extraordinarily limited margin for his majority, just a handful of people,' Kevin Kosar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA via Zoom. Two years ago, at the start of another Congress, Republican Kevin McCarthy faced similar challenges to his bid for the speakership. He was finally elected on the 15th round of voting. If Johnson, or another Republican, is unable to garner enough votes for the speakership the chamber could be without a leader in time for the official certification of Trump’s electoral victory on Jan. 6. Whoever does lead the House will, at least temporarily, hold an even tighter majority after Trump takes office on Jan. 20, as he has picked two House Republicans to join his administration. Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new presidency and Congress are a time for an ambitious legislative agenda. 'He's going to hit tariffs very hard. He's going to focus on the border, and executive orders related to immigration and immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim countries. And then he's going to work on any compromises he can to get through the legislative agenda on things affecting the economy, groceries, as he likes to call it,' Casey Burgat, a professor at The George Washington University in Washington, told VOA via Zoom.

New Orleans takes first steps forward after terrorist attack	NEW ORLEANS — Less than 48 hours after Wednesday morning's attack on their city's iconic French Quarter neighborhood, New Orleanians are trying to find a way forward. It's something they have had to do countless times in the Crescent City's 307-year history. In the past two decades alone, residents and businesses have come back from a series of disasters including a record-breaking oil spill, the public health catastrophe of being one of the nation's first coronavirus hotspots and, of course, Hurricanes Ida and Katrina. This latest disaster — labeled a terrorist attack by the FBI — hit the city at 3:15 a.m. on New Year's Day when 42-year-old U.S. citizen Shamsud-Din Jabbar plowed a white pickup truck through three blocks of Bourbon Street, killing 14 and seriously injuring many more. As the city mourns, local restaurateur Ralph Brennan believes his fellow residents will react in their unique New Orleans way: with defiance in the face of a challenge and love for their shared home. 'We've been through this before with COVID and Katrina,' he said. One of Brennan's restaurants, Red Fish Grill, was at ground zero of Wednesday’s attack. It was allowed to reopen with the rest of Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. 'Every time there is a disaster,' Brennan continued, 'it is our goal to come back as quickly as possible. We want to show the world that New Orleans is safe, and that this tragedy is just a blip in the history of one of the most special cities on the planet.' Processing grief Go to the corner of Canal and Bourbon streets and the first thing you'll notice are reporters, police officers, traffic barriers and caution tape. Look closer, and you'll see a city cautiously determining how to proceed. A jazz trumpeter plays the national anthem nearby. Employees from a neighborhood restaurant hand out free meals to first responders. Visitors pass by on their way to the Sugar Bowl, postponed to Thursday because of the attack. But it's not just downtown. In every corner of New Orleans, residents are wrestling with trauma. Tom Ramsey is a former chef in the city who now supports mass-catering efforts following disasters and along the U.S.-Mexico border. He woke up on Wednesday morning to dozens of missed calls and text messages asking if he was OK. 'I didn't know what they were talking about until I checked the news and saw what happened,' Ramsey said. His first reaction was to contact everyone he knew was in the French Quarter that night. Anything, he said, not to let the news sink in. 'Then, eventually, everyone was accounted for,' Ramsey said. 'I looked at my wife, I put my face in my hands, and I cried — the kind of crying where my chest was heaving, and I was making sounds. I hadn't felt the kind of grief I felt for New Orleans in that moment since I was in New York on 9/11.' Ongoing trauma Mental health experts like Erin Stevens, executive director of Ellie Mental Health Louisiana in New Orleans, said she is worried that residents with so much past trauma may have difficulty dealing with this event. 'When you have already experienced significant trauma, it can cause you to feel new and future stressors more intensely,' she said. I'm especially worried about people who are isolated — who don't have a support system.' However, Stevens says if handled correctly, past trauma can equip you to handle future stressors more effectively, because resilience is something that is built. Some New Orleanians seem to have taken lessons from past challenges. For example, several mental health professionals have decided to help their community by offering free mental health services. And Allison Bullach, a local photographer, is offering free headshots to anyone who gives blood to support the attack's victims. 'I think we just want to find our way to help,' Bullach told VOA, 'and I had read that donating blood for victims was a major need.' 'I'm only one person,' she continued, 'but if I can find a way to encourage three or four or five more people to help, then I should do it.' The show must go on? The past year has been a massive one for New Orleans tourism. In addition to a successful Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, 2024 visitor numbers were bolstered thanks to a three-day stop by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. Early 2025 looked to be equally promising. The Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl LIX, and Carnival season culminating in Mardi Gras are all big news for a local economy so heavily reliant on tourism. As a result, the timing of the attack is a worry for Crescent City businesses. 'Of course, it hurts to have to close during one of our busiest times of the year,' said Brennan, owner of Red Fish Grill. 'We understand why it was necessary, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.' 'But where I got really worried,' he added, 'is how this impacts tourism moving forward for Carnival season and the Super Bowl. New Orleans businesses depend on tourism from these big events.' For some businesses, however, every day matters. Coming off a challenging December, that is definitely the case for Tara Francolini, owner of Francolini's, a popular sandwich shop. 'More than anything, I want to give our staff a day to grieve for their city,' she told VOA. 'But the losses we suffered in December were tremendous, and we need ... steady business so we can do basic things like pay our bills and our employees. I'm worried that staying open diminishes the atrocities that the families of the victims are feeling, and it all makes me feel like an awful human being.' Resilience, a loaded word On Wednesday night, less than 24 hours after the attack, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry ate dinner in the French Quarter, steps from Bourbon Street. He posted a photo from outside the restaurant, a message to would-be visitors that this 'resilient city,' as he and so many others call it, was safe and 'open for business.' The word 'resilient' seems to be attached to the city any time there is a disaster. Many residents identify with it, proof that they can bounce back from anything. Increasingly, however, some say the term is allowing leaders off the hook for their failings. One such critic is Andrew Stephens, owner of Sports Drink, a coffee shop in New Orleans' Irish Channel neighborhood. 'They call us resilient after they shirk their responsibilities to the public,' Stephens said, 'It's pandering. I don't want us to be resilient. I want us to be safe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-takes-first-steps-forward-after-terrorist-attack/7922899.html	2025-01-02T19:23:28-08:00	
Federal courts won't refer US Supreme Court justice Thomas to attorney general over ethics	WASHINGTON — The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department, the judiciary's policymaking body said Thursday. Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips. Thomas has previously said he wasn't required to disclose the many trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal friends. The court didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of enforcement. It's unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts. A referral in this case isn't necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made. The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. 'The Conference's letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,' Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement. Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's reports on the source of her husband's consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and agreed to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-courts-won-t-refer-us-supreme-court-justice-thomas-to-attorney-general-over-ethics/7922889.html	2025-01-02T18:19:43-08:00	
Standoff in Seoul as South Korea's Yoon resists arrest	SEOUL, South Korea — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol resisted efforts to detain him Friday, with investigators and police locked in a tense standoff with military forces and members of Yoon's security service, local media reported. In an early morning raid, a team of investigators and detectives, backed by about 3,000 riot police camped nearby, arrived at Yoon's official residence in central Seoul. But nearly four hours after arriving at the compound, there were no signs Yoon had been detained. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, a military unit, presumed to be part of the military's Capital Defense Command, was preventing Yoon's arrest. In a statement, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the unit was under the control of the Presidential Security Service. The PSS has obstructed previous court-approved searches at Yoon's residence. Yonhap later reported that the team attempting to detain Yoon had breached the outer barrier controlled by the military forces and was in a standoff with the PSS. The events capped an extraordinary month of political chaos that began on December 3, when Yoon, a conservative ex-prosecutor, declared martial law. The declaration was quickly overturned by lawmakers, who later impeached Yoon, suspending his presidential powers. For Yoon to be removed from office, the impeachment must be confirmed by the country's Constitutional Court, which is currently deliberating the matter. Separately, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power related to the martial law declaration. Yoon ignored three separate summonses to appear for questioning as part of that investigation, leading a Seoul court to issue a detention warrant earlier this week. His legal team says the investigation is illegitimate. In a statement Friday, Yoon's lawyers said the attempt to execute the detention warrant was illegal and vowed legal action to stop it. Once Yoon is detained, authorities will have 48 hours to decide whether to file for a formal arrest warrant or to release him. It would be the first time a sitting South Korean president has been taken into police custody.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-investigators-try-to-detain-impeached-yoon/7922885.html	2025-01-02T18:03:18-08:00

Zelenskyy says Trump could be decisive in stopping war in Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could be 'decisive' in the outcome of the yearslong war between Ukraine and Russia. 'Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,' Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television. Zelenskyy said Trump had told him he would be one of the first to visit Washington after the presidential inauguration later this month. 'His qualities are indeed there,' Zelenskyy said about Trump. 'He can be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.' Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that. Zelenskyy's comments came as the Ukrainian military said it had carried out a high-precision strike Thursday on a Russian command post in Maryino, in Russia's Kursk region. 'These strikes disrupt the ability of the Russian Federation to conduct terrorism against innocent Ukrainian civilians,' the Ukrainian military said in a statement on Telegram. Russia's military said air defense units had downed four Ukrainian missiles in the region. The regional governor said the strikes had damaged a high-rise apartment building and other buildings in a nearby village. Another post from the Ukrainian military showed a video of what the military said was damage to a Russian base in Ivanivskoye, next to Maryino. A school, pharmacy and apartment building were among the structures damaged in the strike, Kursk regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. VOA could not immediately verify the reports. Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia five months ago. Ukrainian forces remain in the Kursk region, but the Russian military says much of the lost territory has been regained. Meanwhile, Russia said it had attacked energy facilities in Ukraine that support Kyiv's military-industrial complex. The Russian Defense Ministry said that over the past 24 hours, it had used its air force, drones, missiles and artillery to target energy facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian military personnel across multiple locations. VOA could not independently verify that report. Russian forces have been advancing quickly on the eastern front of Ukraine. 'They are putting pressure on our boys, who are exhausted, and that is a fact. We will do everything to at least stabilize the front in January,' Zelenskyy said in his Thursday interview. Ukraine's military said Thursday that it had shot down 47 drones Russian forces launched overnight at areas in central and eastern Ukraine. Russia used a total of 72 drones in its attacks, the military said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Odessa and Sumy regions. Officials in those areas did not immediately report any major damage. Russia's Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces had destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones, mostly along the Russia-Ukraine border. Intercepts took place in Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Kaluga and Voronezh, it said. The governors of Bryansk and Kaluga said there were no reports of casualties or damage in their regions. Thursday's attacks came a day after Russian forces killed at least two people in Kyiv. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-trump-could-be-decisive-in-stopping-war-in-ukraine-/7922855.html	2025-01-02T17:29:53-08:00	
Israel continues striking Syrian army positions	Israel bombed Syrian army positions south of the city of Aleppo on Thursday, according to residents, local media and rights groups, marking the latest strikes by Israel against a country whose longtime president was overthrown last month. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights group said the strikes targeted defense and research facilities. Residents reported hearing big explosions in their vicinity. Syrian state television reported the strikes early Friday, local time. It was not immediately clear whether the strikes caused any deaths. Islamist-led rebels overthrew longtime Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month. Since then, Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes on Syrian military assets. Israel said the strikes were aimed at keeping military weapons away from extremists. Israel’s continued bombardment of Syria comes as the Israeli military said Thursday that its special forces had raided an underground missile production site in Syria in September. Israel said the site was set to manufacture hundreds of precision missiles that Iran-backed Hezbollah would use against Israel. The complex, near the Mediterranean coast, was 'the flagship of Iranian manufacturing efforts in our region,' Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told reporters. 'This facility was designed to manufacture hundreds of strategic missiles per year from start to finish, for Hezbollah to use in their aerial attacks on Israel,' he added. Shoshani said Israel had been observing the plant since construction began in 2017. Israeli forces raided the complex because it was close to being able to produce precision missiles, some with a range of up to 300 kilometers, or 190 miles. 'This ability was becoming active, so we're talking about an immediate threat,' he said. The operation was complex, Shoshani said, and involved dozens of aircraft and about 100 helicopter-borne troops. The troops dismantled the facility after the raid, he added. 'This is one of the most important counteractions we have taken against the Iranian axis's attempts to arm itself in order to harm us, and it demonstrates our determination and audacity to act anywhere to protect ourselves,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-continues-striking-syrian-army-positions/7922874.html	2025-01-02T17:28:43-08:00	
Carter leaves complex legacy on Korean Peninsula	washington — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has a complex legacy on the Korean Peninsula, former U.S. officials say, including the vital role he played in defusing a crisis between the United States and North Korea in 1994. Thomas Hubbard, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2001 to 2004, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that Carter’s interventions in North Korea significantly lowered tensions, despite somewhat negative reactions from President Bill Clinton’s administration. 'His initial involvement in the early 1990s when he went to North Korea, met with Kim Il Sung, he opened an opportunity that lowered the chances of war and led to the Agreed Framework,' said Hubbard, referring to Carter’s meeting in June 1994 with late North Korean founder Kim Il Sung. Hubbard was a principal negotiator of the Agreed Framework signed by the U.S. and North Korea in Geneva in October 1994, aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. VOA Korean sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations, but did not receive a response. Carter, who was the 39th U.S. president and served from 1977 to 1981, visited Pyongyang as North Korea’s declaration of withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency created the first major crisis over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. He crossed the inter-Korean border in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) from the South Korean side with his wife, Rosalynn, and held talks for two days in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader. Carter was the first former U.S. president to visit the isolated country and to meet North Korea’s head of state. Controversial mission At the time, North Korea threatened to expel IAEA inspectors, demonstrating its intent to develop nuclear weapons, and the United States pushed for U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It was speculated that Clinton was planning a preemptive attack on North Korea. After the talks between Carter and Kim, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for a resumption of dialogue with the U.S. The breakthrough led to the first nuclear deal between the U.S. and North Korea in 40 years, although the agreement fell through in 2003. Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said in an email to VOA Korean on Monday, 'It is not hyperbole to say that it felt like the brink of war. We were right at the edge of the cliff.' As a young diplomat, Russel and then-U.S. Ambassador to South Korea James Laney helped prepare Carter for his trip across the DMZ. North Korea warned that sanctions would be treated as 'an act of war' and started the process to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Russel said. 'The immediate crisis was averted. We had been really close to a war, and Jimmy Carter saved us from that,' he said. Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Carter’s mission was 'ultimately successful, but the Clinton administration was unhappy because Carter didn’t try to get any constraint on North Korea’s nuclear program as part of a resolution of that immediate conflict.' Hubbard offered a similar view. 'What made it controversial, I think, is that Carter accepted some positions that went beyond the Clinton administration’s positions with North Korea, and then he announced them publicly on CNN before even informing us,' Hubbard said. 'That was quite a shock.' CNN, which closely followed Carter’s visit to Pyongyang, first reported that Carter told the North Koreans the U.S. had stopped pursuing international sanctions against North Korea, which Clinton soon flatly denied. Carter visited North Korea twice more in 2010 and 2011 on private humanitarian missions. While his visit in 2010 secured the release of American teacher Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been imprisoned in North Korea for seven months, he failed to meet with Kim Jong Il, who succeeded his father, Kim Il Sung, on either trip. While his post-presidential efforts on the Korean Peninsula are more widely known, Carter’s presidency had another moment of controversy, as his push for the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from South Korea shook the U.S.-South Korea alliance. Push for human rights When he assumed the presidency, Carter was determined not to overlook the human rights abuses of U.S. allies. He found it problematic that the United States would support a country under a repressive government. To him, South Korea was such a country then. 'One of the big things Carter campaigned on was human rights,' Samore said. 'At the time, South Korea was ruled by a military government, and he wanted to reduce relations with countries that were not democracies.' The former president, who pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea during his presidential campaign, had a war of words with then-South Korean President Park Chung-hee over the issue during his 1979 visit to South Korea, according to diplomatic documents from both countries. According to a declassified document from the White House, Park criticized the planned withdrawal of U.S. Forces Korea, arguing the idea itself had emboldened North Korea. To this, Carter suggested that South Korea should increase defense spending. Joseph DeTrani, former special envoy for the Six-Party Talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA Korean on Monday by phone that one of the factors behind Carter’s decision was the burgeoning U.S. relationship with China, which fought against the U.S. during the 1950-53 Korean War in support of North Korea. 'We were normalizing relations with the People’s Republic of China. There was a sense that war was not going to break out on the Korean Peninsula,' said DeTrani, who also served as director of East Asia operations at the Central Intelligence Agency. 'Those people who follow developments on the Korean Peninsula felt that was not the right decision,' he said. U.S. troop withdrawal from the East Asian ally was ultimately not realized, largely over opposition from the U.S. Congress and the military. 'President Carter was interested in waging peace everywhere, wherever there is conflict. He didn’t believe there was the necessary need for Americans to station so many troops in so many places,' Yawei Liu, senior adviser on China at the Carter Center, told VOA Korean by phone on Monday. Carter died Sunday at his home in Georgia at age 100. The official state funeral for Carter will be held January 9 in Washington. South Korea’s foreign ministry expressed condolences at Carter’s passing. 'He was particularly interested in promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula and actively worked on it,' it said in a statement released Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/carter-leaves-complex-legacy-on-korean-peninsula/7922839.html	2025-01-02T16:54:50-08:00	
China targets US defense companies with new sanctions	In the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, China on Thursday announced export control measures targeting 28 U.S. companies and added 10 U.S. companies to a list of entities barred from doing business in China. The larger group of companies is made up primarily of firms active in defense contracting and includes Lockheed Martin and five of its subsidiaries; General Dynamics and three of its subsidiaries; three subsidiaries of Raytheon; one subsidiary of Boeing; and more than a dozen other companies. Chinese companies are immediately barred from selling 'dual-use' items — goods that may have a military purpose in addition to civilian applications — to any of the named companies. In an announcement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the sanctions were put in place 'in order to safeguard national security … interests and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation.' Negligible impact Experts pointed out that because U.S. defense contractors don't typically do business with the country's major adversaries, the new restrictions would likely have little impact on the companies named by China. 'Short answer is, this won't have much, if any effect, on those companies: They didn't do business with China anyway,' Raymond Kuo, a director and senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA. He said that move would also have no noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy. However, he added, the sanctions do illustrate that China is determined to respond when the U.S. applies sanctions in the other direction, as the Biden administration has done several times in recent months. 'It does show that the Chinese are willing to go kind of tit for tat with the United States,' Kuo said. 'If we increase our levels of trade sanctions — and [President-elect Donald] Trump has threatened 60% tariffs across the board — that they can hit back in a whole variety of ways.' 'Unreliable' entities In a second announcement, the Ministry of Commerce added 10 of the companies from the first announcement, all subsidiaries of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon, to its list of 'unreliable entities,' a designation that entails a much stricter set of sanctions. The companies are prohibited from importing or exporting goods to and from China and from making new investments there. In addition, executives of the companies are barred from traveling to China, and any work or residency permits they currently have are revoked. The Ministry of Commerce said that all of the companies designated as unreliable have sold arms to Taiwan, the democratically self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. It said the new restrictions were meant to 'safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.' The additions to the unreliable entities list come just a week after Beijing, on December 27, announced an earlier round of sanctions targeting U.S. firms and their executives for selling arms to Taiwan. The companies named included subsidiaries of Raytheon and Boeing. In a statement emailed to VOA, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said it was determined that the 28 companies facing export controls 'endanger China's national security.' He also said, 'The Chinese government will continue to unswervingly promote high-level opening up, firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of various business entities, and promote the development of compliant trade.' Follows other sanctions Thursday's announcement follows other recent actions by Beijing cracking down on trade with the U.S., often in response to U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses. In early December, the Biden administration announced a ban on the sale to Chinese firms of cutting-edge equipment used to make the world's most advanced semiconductors as well as high-bandwidth memory products needed to maximize those chips' efficiency. At the same time, the U.S. added 140 Chinese companies to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with. In response, China imposed new restrictions on the sale of 'rare earth' minerals to the United States. China dominates the world market for minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, which are key components in various high-tech products from smartphones to missile guidance systems. Little more than a month earlier, the Biden administration had finalized a new set of rules on outbound U.S. investments in China. The rule codified a set of restrictions barring U.S. individuals and firms from investing in certain kinds of business ventures in China. Among the areas affected are the manufacture of advanced semiconductors and microelectronics, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-targets-us-defense-companies-with-new-sanctions-/7922841.html	2025-01-02T16:17:13-08:00

Ukraine blocks transit of Russian gas to Europe, prompting price hike	London — European gas prices reached a 15-month high on Thursday after Ukraine blocked the transit of Russian gas across its territory into the European Union. The Russian state-run firm Gazprom is set to lose more than $5 billion a year following the route's closure, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called 'one of Moscow's biggest defeats.' Kyiv will lose about $800 million in transit fees from Moscow. Despite the rise in gas prices on Thursday, the impact on Europe will likely be limited, said energy analyst Thomas O'Donnell, a global fellow at the Wilson Center based in Berlin. 'It was all prepared for. It's basically all priced in. Of course, there's winners and losers to a certain point. Certain countries are more dependent on this than others - Slovakia and Hungary, for example, and Austria,' O'Donnell told VOA. 'Austria is pretty well prepared. They have alternative supplies lined up from Germany and Italy and others. And Slovakia will not run out of gas. They will have plenty of gas. It's just that they'll have to pay more, like everybody else has all along,' he added. Moldova was among the countries most reliant on Russian gas supplied via Ukraine. In the breakaway region of Transnistria, which is controlled by Russian forces, residents lost heating and hot water on Wednesday as authorities urged people to dress warmly and use electric heaters. Ukraine war Ukraine's Zelenskyy indicated last month that he would not renew a five-year contract to allow the transit of Russian gas across his country, which expired on December 31, explaining that he would no longer give Moscow 'the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.' Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Europe has since managed to wean itself off Moscow's gas supplies far more quickly than Russian President Vladimir Putin anticipated, O'Donnell said. 'He thought this would force all the European countries that get this gas into a situation where they would capitulate — and they would be unwilling to support Ukraine in the war, and unwilling to show their solidarity. He also thought the war would be over in three or four days. But it just didn't work,' O'Donnell said. 'They've lost their entire European market, essentially. The second-largest gas fields in the world in Western Siberia have no outlet now,' he added. 'Putin portrays himself as a great Russian nationalist. Well, this great Russian nationalist just lost one of the biggest businesses Russia ever had.' In 2023, Gazprom recorded a loss of almost $7 billion, its first annual loss since 1999. Slovakia anger Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who enjoys a close relationship with Putin, has strongly criticized Ukraine's decision. Putin hosted Fico last month in Moscow, where the two leaders reportedly discussed the future of Russia's gas exports. Fico also opposes Western support for Kyiv in its war against Russian invaders. Speaking on Wednesday after Ukraine's termination of the transit deal, the Slovakian leader accused the EU of sacrificing the interests of smaller states. 'We must see that selfish national interests of the big [member states] and meaningless geopolitical goals are beginning to dominate this community ... ignoring the needs of smaller ones,' Fico said in a televised address. 'When the transit of gas through Ukraine is stopped, [it] will have drastic impacts on all of us in the European Union, but not on the Russian Federation.' European dependence In reality, the European Union has drastically cut its dependence on Russian gas since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow supplied over 40% of the bloc's gas needs in 2021, but that had fallen to about 8% by 2023, according to EU figures. Europe has found new suppliers, said O'Donnell. 'Norway has done all they could to increase their supplies, and that's been extremely helpful. They're now on the scale of what Russia used to be,' he said. 'Number two, the United States zoomed up its supplies to Europe,' he added. 'This was very crucial. In 2023, something like 67% of all [liquefied natural gas] that's exported from the U.S., which is a huge amount, was going to Europe. And that supplied 47% of their LNG. I think in 2024, it looks like it supplied about 37%.' EU-US trade EU officials have indicated that the bloc will seek to strengthen its energy trade with the U.S. under its next president, Donald Trump. 'We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector,' EU Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said on December 20. 'And as you all know very well, the EU is committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply.' Slovakia's Fico, however, has threatened to cut the transit of European electricity to Ukraine in retaliation for Kyiv's decision to cease transiting Russian gas. Imports of Russian gas through Ukraine made up about 5% of Europe's total supplies in 2024. Some of the gas was sent on to Western Europe through Slovakia — and that largely explains Fico's concerns, said O'Donnell. 'Slovakia was making something like half a billion dollars on transit fees passing the [Russian] gas across their country through their pipeline system onto others — so, redistributing the gas,' he said. 'Security risk' In a post on the social media site X, Zelenskyy said that Fico's relationship with Putin was a big security issue for Europe because 'his key goal is to deal with Russia, and this is what benefits him. Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?' Zelenskyy wrote on December 23. Moscow's other supply routes to Europe are limited. The Yamal-Europe pipeline via Belarus was shut down in 2022 following a payment dispute between Russia and Poland and has not reopened. Months later, the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany was blown up. It remains unclear who was responsible. Russia is still able to supply gas to Hungary, Turkey and Serbia through the TurkStream pipeline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-blocks-transit-of-russian-gas-to-europe-prompting-price-hike-/7922499.html	2025-01-02T13:47:20-08:00

Amendments to school textbooks by Syria's new authorities draw outcry	WASHINGTON — Amendments to school textbooks by Syria's new authorities have sparked outrage from parents, educators and rights groups. The changes, announced Wednesday, affect first-to-12th-grade schoolbooks in all Syrian schools, with a focus on history, religion and science textbooks. The Education Ministry under the country’s caretaker government announced the decision following the overthrow of former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in an Islamist-led rebel offensive just weeks ago. The changes include removing all content 'glorifying' the former Syrian regime, its leaders, symbols, and the Baath party, which had ruled Syria since 1963. The ministry’s directive also mandates revisions in subjects such as history, religion and science. For example, any reference to women, love and pre-Islamic gods are to be removed from textbooks. Additionally, the ministry has ordered the removal of an entire unit on human evolution from a science textbook. Fadwa, a mother of two schoolchildren in Damascus who only gave her first name, expressed her disappointment over the revisions. 'You can remove all mentions of Assad and his regime from all books, but you cannot erase history and obscure science — it’s just wrong,' she told VOA via messaging app. 'This is not a political matter, but it concerns the future of our children and country.' Fadwa is deeply concerned about her children’s education, she said, if the amendments are not reversed. The caretaker government, including the Education Ministry, is dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist militant group that led the offensive leading to the ouster of Assad on Dec. 8. HTS, once considered al-Qaida’s Syria branch, formally severed ties with the global terror group in 2016. However, experts note, it continues to uphold a radical Islamist ideology. HTS leaders have pledged to establish an inclusive transitional government that reflects Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity. Observers argue, though, that some of the group’s actions on the ground contradict these claims. 'They say all the good things on television, but the reality is that this group is imposing its ideology on Syrians,' said Youssif Ahmed, a Syrian educator. 'They have no legitimate mandate to make drastic changes on such an important issue as education,' he told VOA. 'These matters require patience and expertise, which I’m not sure these people have. They are in a rush to make these big changes which, if implemented, will have long-term implications for the education process in this country.' Ahmed pointed out as an example the new revisions in which the term 'Ottoman occupation' of Syria has been replaced with 'Ottoman rule.' 'This is not a move to correct a historical error, but it shows their intention to appease their Turkish allies,' he said. Turkey, a key backer of the rebels since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, says it has played a role in supporting the offensive that led to Assad’s overthrow. Turkish officials have said Ankara will help the new rulers in Damascus rebuild Syria’s political and economic structures. While some adjustments such as removing content praising Assad are seen as positive, other revisions raise serious concerns, said Rami Jarrah, a prominent Syrian journalist. 'These amendments require an inclusive framework that ensures representation from all segments of Syrian society in the decision-making process,' he wrote on social media platform X. 'Without this inclusivity, these unilateral changes risk deepening societal divisions and undermining the principles of shared governance and national unity.' In response to growing criticism, Nazir al-Qadri, the caretaker government’s minister of education, said the curricula in all Syrian schools should remain as is until specialized committees are formed to review them. 'We have only directed the deletion of what glorifies the former Assad regime, and we have adopted images of the Syrian Revolution flag instead of the flag of the former regime in all schoolbooks,' Qadri said in a statement on Thursday. 'What has been announced is a modification of some of the incorrect information that the former Assad regime adopted in the Islamic education curriculum, such as explaining some Quranic verses in a wrong way,' he said. 'We have adopted their correct explanation as stated in the interpretation books for all educational levels.' One such revision includes adding the terms 'Jews' and 'Christians' to the explanation of a verse in the Quran, the holy Muslim book, about those who angered God. The Assyrian Monitor for Human Rights, a Christian advocacy group based in Sweden, says such amendments pose a danger to religious coexistence in Syria. 'This action is considered an explicit incitement to religious hatred and the spread of discrimination and exclusion speech,' the group said in a statement on Thursday. 'This interpretation contradicts the principles of religious tolerance and coexistence that have always distinguished the Syrian society.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, wrote on X that 'the new Syria school textbooks are moving from a nationalist to Islamist interpretation of Syrian history.'

US appeals court blocks Biden administration effort to restore net neutrality rules	Washington — A U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday the Federal Communications Commission did not have legal authority to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules. The decision is a blow to the outgoing Biden administration that had made restoring the open internet rules a priority. President Joe Biden signed a 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules. A three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FCC lacked authority to reinstate the rules initially implemented in 2015 by the agency under Democratic former President Barack Obama, but then repealed by the commission in 2017 under Republican former President Donald Trump. Net-neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favored users. The court cited the Supreme Court's June decision in a case known as Loper Bright to overturn a 1984 precedent that had given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, in the latest decision to curb the authority of federal agencies. 'Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations,' the court ruled. The decision leaves in place state neutrality rules adopted by California and others but may end more than 20 years of efforts to give federal regulators sweeping oversight over the internet. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to act after the decision. 'Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair. With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law,' Rosenworcel said in a statement. The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules. Industry groups filed suit and successfully convinced the court to temporarily block the rules as they considered the case. Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr voted against the reinstatement last year. He did not immediately comment on Thursday. Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai said the court ruling should mean the end of efforts to reinstate the rules, and a focus shift to 'what actually matters to American consumers - like improving Internet access and promoting online innovation.' The Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the decision but net-neutrality advocates could seek review by the Supreme Court. The rules would have given the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages. A group representing companies including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms META.O had backed the FCC net-neutrality rules, while USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N, last year called reinstating net neutrality 'entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer regulatory distraction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-rules/7922331.html	2025-01-02T11:21:55-08:00	
Russia ramps up disinformation efforts as its grip weakens over post-Assad Syria	The Kremlin is using uncertainty following the ouster of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, and the potential loss of Russia’s military toehold in Syria, to accuse the United States of sowing instability in the country. On Dec. 29, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signaled that the end of the Assad regime would push Russia to 'make certain adjustments to Russia’s military presence in Syria.' Lavrov said the continued deployment of Russian forces and the future of its bases 'could be the subject of negotiations with the new Syrian leadership.' Particularly of concern to Moscow are the fates of its Tartus naval base and the Hmeimim air base located on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The naval base established by the Soviet Union during the cold war, and the air base in 2015 as a strategic command post, both served as Russia’s military hubs in the Middle East. Amid this backdrop, Russian intelligence is pushing conspiracy theories that the U.S. and allies are planning attacks on those facilities and otherwise seeking to destabilize the country. On Dec. 28, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, accused U.S. and British intelligence agencies of 'working out plans to stage a series of terrorist attacks on the Russian military facilities in Syria.' Those plans, the SVR claimed, without evidence, would involve the use of Islamic State, or IS, militants. Russia has long propagated the false narrative that the U.S. sought the ouster of Assad to destabilize the Middle East and control its oil resources. Despite Russia’s claim, the U.S. has worked for years to eradicate the IS threat, including with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in Syria’s northeast. The U.S. and SDF defeated IS in its final holdout, Baghuz, near Syria’s Iraqi border, in March 2019. That year, U.S. forces killed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid in northwestern Syria. The Kurds oversee prisons housing thousands of IS fighters and their families. Russian forces, by contrast, regularly targeted armed groups who were fighting IS, and did not prioritize fighting IS terrorists during Moscow’s intervention in Syria. On Dec. 19, the U.S. Defense Department announced an additional 1,100 U.S. personnel had been deployed to Syria, bringing the total to 2,000 U.S. troops, to help stabilize the situation in the post-Assad era. At the same time, the United States Central Command, CENTCOM, has announced multiple airstrikes against IS targets to prevent the terrorist group from reestablishing foothold in the country. One U.S. airstrike on Dec. 19 killed IS leader Abu Yusif and other IS operatives 'in an area formerly controlled by the Syrian regime and Russians.' 'As stated before, the United States — working with allies and partners in the region — will not allow ISIS to take advantage of the current situation in Syria and reconstitute,' CENTCOM Commander, General Michael Erik Kurilla said in a Dec. 20 statement. 'ISIS has the intent to break out of detention the over 8,000 ISIS operatives currently being held in facilities in Syria. We will aggressively target these leaders and operatives, including those trying to conduct operations external to Syria,' Kurilla said. With Assad gone, there are signs Russia is doubtful about its ability to maintain military presence in Syria. In recent weeks, Russian cargo planes reportedly carrying military equipment have flown from Syria to eastern Libya, much of which is under the control of Khalifa Haftar, described by France 24 as 'Russia’s man' in the country. Russia also has reportedly shifted military assets to bases in Mali and Sudan, where Moscow maintains a presence of its African Corps — formerly Wagner — troops. Despite efforts to find alternatives, experts say Russia’s potential loss of its bases in Syria could seriously dampen Russia’s ability to project power in the Middle East and throughout Africa. On Dec. 30, Al Jazeera reported that Syria’s new government had set up checkpoints around Hmeimim air base. Syrian security forces alleged Russia was harboring Assad loyalists at the facility. The rebel fighters who ousted Assad and many locals view Russian troops as occupiers, and they want Moscow to withdraw its military presence, Al Jazeera reported. That report described Hmeimim as a 'thorn' in the hearts of the Syrian rebels who had recaptured the country earlier that month, citing the destruction Russian airstrikes had subjected them to up until Assad’s last days in power. As in Syria, Russia previously accused the U.S. and U.K. of supporting Islamic State – Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, in Afghanistan, despite longtime U.S. efforts to eradicate ISIS-K and its leadership there. That allegation fits into the broader conspiracy theory repeatedly spread by Russia and Iran that the U.S. created Islamic State to destabilize the Middle East and serve the foreign policy goals of the U.S. and Israel. Throughout the decade of the civil war, Russia framed its support for Assad and military presence in Syria, including the deployment of long-range bombers to Hmeimim air base, as a stabilizing force in the country. Contrary to that narrative, Russia indiscriminately attacked civilian targets, particularly hospitals, and allegedly killed tens of thousands of people throughout the course of the Syrian civil war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ramps-up-disinformation-efforts-as-its-grip-weakens-over-post-assad-syria/7922328.html	2025-01-02T11:09:35-08:00	
Man who died in Las Vegas Tesla truck blast was US Army soldier, officials say	LAS VEGAS, Nevada — The person who authorities believe died in the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel was an active-duty U.S. Army soldier, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Thursday. Two law enforcement officials identified the man inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck as Matthew Livelsberger. The law enforcement officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. Three U.S. officials said Livelsberger was an active-duty Army member, who spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to Army special forces command. The officials also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of his service. The truck explosion came hours after a driver, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone. Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran, also spent time at Fort Bragg but one official said so far there is no overlap in their assignments there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-died-in-las-vegas-tesla-truck-blast-was-us-army-soldier-officials-say/7922125.html	2025-01-02T08:38:42-08:00	
Dinosaur highway' tracks dating back 166 million years discovered in England	LONDON — A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a 'dinosaur highway' and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday. The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said. 'These footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,' said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham. Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 18 meters in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago. An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores. 'Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,' said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings. The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved. 'The preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur's feet squelched in and out,' said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. 'Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.' The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's Digging for Britain program next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dinosaur-highway-tracks-dating-back-166-million-years-discovered-in-england/7922082.html	2025-01-02T07:59:50-08:00	
Montenegro mourns after gunman kills at least 12 people before shooting himself	CETINJE, Montenegro — Shock and dismay prevailed in Montenegro on Thursday after a gunman fatally shot 12 people, including two children, in a western town before killing himself. At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said. This was the second such incident in the town in the past three years. The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinovic, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, officials have said. The attacker, who first fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic said. Residents of Cetinje, a town of some 17,000 people, were stunned and grief-stricken. 'I knew all of these people personally, also the attacker. I think when he did that, he was out of his mind,' said Vesko Milosevic, a retiree from Cetnje. 'What do I know, he went from place to place and killed people. It's a catastrophe.' Vanja Popovic, whose relatives are among the victims, said that 'we are all in shock.' 'How can I feel after this?' Popovic said. 'No one expected it. You can't even ask anyone anything.' Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Podgorica, the capital. All roads in and out of the city were blocked for hours as police swarmed the streets. Saranovic said that the shooter had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the 'severity of his injuries.' Officials have said that the attacker was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted. He then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. Prosecutor Andrijana Nastic said Thursday that the attacker went to six locations during the shooting rampage, including the last one, where he shot himself. Four men were killed at the bar, Nastic said. The shooter then moved on to another location where he killed four more people, and then two children at a third site. He then went on to kill two more people at two other locations before eventually shooting himself, Nastic said. 'Further investigation will determine the exact circumstances of the events,' she added. The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, and all planned New Year's festivities have been canceled throughout the country. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic said that the government may try to impose a total ban on weapons 'because we must ask ourselves after this who should be allowed to have guns in Montenegro.' The small Adriatic Sea nation, which has a population of around 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. In August 2022 in Cetinje, which is Montenegro's historic capital, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Montenegro's President Jakov Milatovic said in a post on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-mourns-after-gunman-kills-at-least-12-people-before-shooting-himself/7922074.html	2025-01-02T07:56:34-08:00	
Italy summons Iranian ambassador, demands release of journalist	Rome — Italy's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of reporter Cecilia Sala, who was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. The ministry said in a statement it had relayed 'serious concern' over Sala's detention and stressed the need for humane treatment and respect for her human rights. Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day. Her glasses have been confiscated and she has had hardly any contact with the outside world. The secretary general of the Italian foreign ministry, Riccardo Guariglia, demanded that embassy staff in Tehran should be allowed to visit Sala and provide her with 'the comfort items that she has been denied so far', the ministry said. Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday that Sala had been arrested for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic'. It gave no further information. Sala was detained three days after an Iranian businessman, Mohammad Abedini, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack, and its foreign ministry was quoted in Iranian media as saying Abedini's arrest violated international law. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies this. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to discuss Sala's case with her foreign and justice ministers later on Thursday, her office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-summons-iranian-ambassador-demands-release-of-journalist/7921945.html	2025-01-02T05:51:23-08:00	
Syrian security forces search for pro-Assad militants in Homs, state media say	Syrian security forces searched Thursday for former soldiers and pro-Assad militants in the city of Homs who have refused to turn in their weapons, state media said. The SANA news agency cited a military official saying the rebels who ousted longtime President Bashar al-Assad had set up centers in Homs for the soldiers and militants to turn in their arms in a process carried out in other parts of Syria. The report said the new Syrian authorities received reports weeks ago that there were remnants of pro-Assad militias in Homs. A few dozen protesters gathered in the Syrian city of Douma on Wednesday to demand answers in the disappearance of four prominent activists who were abducted more than a decade ago. The demonstrators called on Syria’s new rulers — the Islamist-led rebels who seized power last month — to investigate what happened to them. The activists in question are Razan Zaitouneh, her husband, Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. On December 9, 2013, unidentified gunmen stormed the Violations Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and abducted the four activists. The center was set up in 2011 to monitor human rights violations in Syria. At the time, Douma was held by rebels. There has been no sign of life or proof of death since they were abducted. Zaitouneh was one of Syria’s most prominent human rights activists, in part because she documented abuses by then-President Assad’s government and rebel groups in equal measure. Zaitouneh’s work earned her global recognition, including an International Woman of Courage Award presented by then-U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. At the Wednesday protest, demonstrators held up photos of the missing activists. 'We are here because we want to know the whole truth about two women and two men who were disappeared from this place 11 years and 22 days ago,' said activist Yassin Al-Haj Saleh, whose wife, Khalil, was among those abducted. 'We are gathering here to remind the world of their case,' he added. 'This is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.' Since the Assad government was ousted last month, protests have occurred across the country, calling for information about the thousands of people who disappeared by force under Assad’s rule. Syria’s transitional government — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the ouster of Assad — has been neutral regarding accusations against various armed groups in the enforced disappearance of activists. HTS has also aligned with activists in their efforts to seek truth and justice. 'We are here because we want the truth. The truth about their fate and justice for them, so that we may heal our wounds,' said Alaa al-Merhi, Khalil’s niece. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, but signs point to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time. The group has long denied involvement. Zaitouneh had received threats from both the government and rebels before she went missing. Friends and activists have said some of the threats can be traced to the Army of Islam. Protesters on Wednesday held banners accusing the Army of Islam of the abduction. 'We have enough evidence to incriminate Jaish al-Islam, and we have the names of suspects we would like to see investigated,' Haj Saleh said, using another name for the group. He said he wanted 'the perpetrators to be tried by the Syrian courts.' The Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It is excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership.

Biden honoring 20 Americans with Presidential Citizens Medal	U.S. President Joe Biden is set to award the nation’s second highest civilian honor to 20 people at a White House ceremony Thursday. The recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal include Congressman Bennie Thompson and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Cheney, who led a congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden’s 2020 election win over Donald Trump. Trump, who won the 2024 election for a new term starting later this month, has said Thompson and Cheney should be jailed. A White House statement about Thursday’s honorees said Cheney, a Republican, 'raised her voice—and reached across the aisle—to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency.' The statement said Thompson was 'at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth.' Created in 1969, the Presidential Citizens Medal honors citizens 'who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.' 'President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others,' the White House said. 'The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice.' Also being honored Thursday are Mary Bonauto and Evan Wolfson, who worked to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States. Frank Butler is another medal recipient, with the White House highlighting his effort to set standards for the use of tourniquets and saying he 'transformed battlefield trauma care for the United States military and saved countless lives.' Mitsuye Endo Tsutsumi is being honored for her successful legal challenge against the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Biden is honoring Eleanor Smeal for her work in leading women’s rights protests and fighting for equal pay for women. Medals are being awarded to a former congresswoman, Carolyn McCarthy, and a group of former U.S. senators: Bill Bradley, Chris Dodd, Nancy Kassebaum and Ted Kaufman. Other honorees include Diane Carlson Evans, founder of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, war correspondent Joseph Galloway, civil rights advocate Louis Redding and photographer Bobby Sager. Judge Collins Seitz, Fulbright University Vietnam founder Thomas Vallely, breast cancer research advocate Frances Visco and Savannah College of Art and Design founder Paula Wallace are also receiving the Presidential Citizens Medal.

South Korea police search Jeju Air, airport operator over fatal plane crash	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean police said on Thursday they had raided Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of their investigation into Sunday's crash that killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on the country's soil. Jeju Air 7C2216, which departed the Thai capital of Bangkok for Muan in southwestern South Korea, belly-landed and overshot the regional airport's runway, exploding into flames after hitting an embankment. Two crew members, who were sitting in the tail end of the Boeing 737-800, were pulled out alive by rescuers but injured. The conversion of data from the cockpit voice recorder to audio files, which could provide critical information on the final minutes of the flight, was completed on Thursday, Joo Jong-wan, the deputy transport minister for civil aviation, told a media briefing. Police investigators were searching the offices of the airport operator and the transportation ministry aviation authority in the southwestern county of Muan, as the well as office of Jeju Air in Seoul, the South Jeolla provincial police said in a media statement. Investigators planned to seize documents and materials related to the operation and maintenance of the aircraft as well as the operation of airport facilities, a police official told Reuters. Jeju Air was cooperating with the police, a director at the airline, Song Kyeong-hoon, told a media briefing. Questions by air safety experts on what led to the deadly explosion have focused on the embankment, designed to prop up the 'localizer' antenna used to guide landings, which they said is too rigid and too close to the end of the runway. 'This rigid structure proved catastrophic when the skidding aircraft made impact,' said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, adding it was concerning that the navigation antenna was mounted on 'such a formidable concrete structure, rather than the standard metal tower/pylon installation.' Joo said the ministry was still unable to provide clear details on Muan airport's upgrade plans that had led to the addition of the structure to support the navigation system. The ministry is conducting a check on localizer equipment at airports throughout the country, Joo said. A probe into the doomed Jeju Air flight is also under way involving South Korean officials and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the aircraft's maker, Boeing. It remains unanswered why the aircraft did not deploy its landing gear and what led the pilot to apparently rush into a second attempt at landing after telling air traffic control the plane had suffered a bird strike and declaring an emergency. The aircraft's flight data recorder, which sustained some damage, is being taken to the United States for analysis in cooperation with the NTSB. Joo said on Wednesday it may be difficult to release the audio files from the cockpit voice recorder to the public as they will be critical to the ongoing investigation. Investigators from the NTSB, FAA and Boeing are in South Korea to help the probe. South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok said in a disaster management meeting immediate action must be taken if a special inspection of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated in the country finds any issues. 'As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant organizations must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training,' Choi said. His comments at the start of the meeting were provided by his office. Choi asked that no effort be spared in helping the families of the victims as the remains of those killed are handed over them. He also asked the police to take action against anyone posting 'malicious' messages and fake news on social media related to the disaster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-police-search-jeju-air-airport-operator-over-fatal-plane-crash/7921782.html	2025-01-02T00:34:13-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes kill at least 10 in southern Gaza	Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike Thursday killed at least 10 people and injured 15 others in southern Gaza. The strike hit a tent camp housing displaced families in the al-Mawasi area west of the city of Khan Younis. Those killed included Gaza police chief Mahmoud Salah and his aide, Hussam Shahwan, officials said. Israel warned Wednesday it will intensify its strikes against Hamas if the militant group continues to hold the hostages it took in October 2023 and launches rockets at Israel. 'I want to send a clear message from here to the heads of the terrorists in Gaza: If Hamas does not soon allow the release of the Israeli hostages from Gaza ... and continues firing at Israeli communities, it will face blows of an intensity not seen in Gaza for a long time,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. About 100 hostages are being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror organization.

South Korea's impeached president resists arrest over martial law bid	SEOUL, South Korea — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol remained defiantly inside his residence resisting arrest for a third day on Thursday after vowing to 'fight' authorities seeking to question him over his failed martial law bid. The embattled leader issued the bungled declaration on Dec. 3 that led to his impeachment and has left him facing arrest, imprisonment or, at worst, the death penalty. Supporters and opponents of Yoon have since camped outside his presidential residence, while members of his security team have blocked attempted police raids in a dramatic stand-off. Yoon has gone to ground but remained unrepentant as the crisis has rolled on, issuing a defiant message to his base days before an arrest warrant expires on Jan. 6. 'The Republic of Korea is currently in danger due to internal and external forces threatening its sovereignty, and the activities of anti-state elements,' he said in a statement passed around to protesters, his lawyer Yoon Kab-keun confirmed to AFP. 'I vow to fight alongside you to the very end to protect this nation,' he added, saying he watched the hundreds-strong protest on Wednesday evening on a YouTube livestream. Yoon Kab-keun confirmed to AFP that the impeached leader remained inside the presidential compound. 'The president is at the (official presidential) residence,' he said. Opposition lawmakers were quick to condemn Yoon Suk Yeol's defiant message as inflammatory, with Democratic Party spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae calling him 'delusional' and accusing him of trying to incite clashes. The suspended president's legal team has filed for an injunction to block the warrant and described the arrest order on Wednesday as 'an unlawful and invalid act.' - Blocked raids - Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) chief Oh Dong-woon warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol could face prosecution. Along with the summons, a Seoul court issued a search warrant for his official residence and other locations, a CIO official told AFP. The presidential security service's official stance has been to treat the warrants with due process. It remains unclear how many guards are stationed with him but they have blocked searches of his office and residence. They have cited two articles in South Korea's Criminal Procedure Act that prohibit seizure from locations where official secrets are stored, without consent of the person in charge. South Korean officials have previously failed to execute similar arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police for the seven-day period the warrants were valid. However, discussions between prosecutors and police about Yoon Suk Yeol's arrest are taking place in the background of the political crisis that saw the country briefly lurch back to the dark days of military rule. Refused questioning The martial law order, which Yoon Suk Yeol said was aimed at eliminating 'anti-state elements,' only lasted a few hours. Armed troops stormed the national assembly building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter, but the president was quickly forced to make a U-turn after lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down. He was then stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and now faces criminal charges of insurrection. Yoon Suk Yeol has since refused summonses for questioning three times and doubled down on claims the opposition was in league with South Korea's communist enemies. Supporters have raced to Seoul to support him in the wake of his refusal, spewing vitriol at police and waving anti-impeachment placards. A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold his impeachment. The turmoil deepened late last week when his replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok has been installed as acting president and pledged to do all he can to end the political upheaval. He has since decided to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court, a key demand of the opposition, but was criticized by Yoon Suk Yeol's staff as overstepping his powers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-impeached-president-resists-arrest-over-martial-law-bid/7921762.html	2025-01-01T23:17:30-08:00	
Authorities conduct searches in probe of truck attack that killed at least 15	The FBI said late Wednesday authorities were conducting search warrants in New Orleans, Louisiana, and states outside Louisiana as they investigate the attack in which a driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd and opened fire, killing at least 15 people and injuring at least 30. Investigators were still working late Wednesday to gather evidence at the scene of the early morning New Year's Day attack on New Orleans' popular Bourbon Street. So far, the FBI has identified the suspect as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar. The agency said it was investigating the attack as an act of terrorism, and that authorities do not believe the driver acted alone. 'The killer was an American citizen born in Texas,' U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday night. 'He served in the United States Army in active duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago.' Hours earlier, the suspect indicated in videos posted on social media that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag was found in the vehicle after the attack. Biden said law enforcement and the intelligence community were searching for any potential 'connections, associations or co-conspirators.' 'So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its history, its culture, and above all, its people,' Biden said. 'So, I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will shine forth.' Early morning attack The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press conference earlier Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. 'My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities,' Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,' Trump said. 'The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident 'a horrific act of violence.' Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football's Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials confirmed that the game would be postponed until Thursday night. Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL's Super Bowl on February 9.

Islamic State group-inspired New Orleans attack revives familiar fears	WASHINGTON — Even before the shock from the deadly New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans could subside, early indications from the investigation pointed to a scenario U.S. law enforcement and security officials have long feared – a plot at least inspired by the Islamic State terror group. The FBI Wednesday confirmed reports the suspect had planted an IS flag in the pickup truck he used to plow into a crowd on Bourbon Street in the early hours of Wednesday morning before he was killed during a shootout with police. Late Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said the FBI found the suspect had taken other actions 'mere hours before the attack' to make his loyalty known. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen and former Army reservist, had 'posted videos on social media indicating that it was inspired by ISIS,' Biden said, using another name for the terror group. 'The situation is very fluid,' Biden added. 'The law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators,' he said. However, that investigation included the execution of search warrants at various locations in New Orleans and other states, an operation by the FBI and other law enforcement officials at a traffic intersection in Houston and questions as to whether there could be any connection to an attempt to blow up a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Regardless of additional conspirators or connections, details of the New Orleans attack itself correspond with tactics long espoused by IS propagandists. 'What we saw fits in with the common pattern we’ve seen from the Islamic State for a while,' said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who specializes in jihadism. 'They’ve been calling for car ramming attacks for years.' 'Every day they put out pushes for supporters, prospective recruits, anyone to do something on their behalf,' Zelin told VOA. One of the first IS-linked attacks using a vehicle as a weapon took place in Nice, France, in 2016. A 31-year-old Tunisian-born Frenchman who was divorced and suffered from depression plowed into a Bastille Day celebration, killing more than 80 people. Months later, a 24-year-old Tunisian man used a truck to drive into crowds at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. He, too, posted a video pledging allegiance to IS before carrying out the attack. IS additionally claimed a November 2017 truck ramming attack in New York that killed at least eight people, in which police officials said the attacker followed IS instructions on vehicle attacks 'almost exactly to a T.' Even as the IS terror group retreated from counterterrorism pressure in places like Syria and Afghanistan, its leaders never abandoned the quest to inspire attacks around the world. 'In Afghanistan ... ISIS-Khorasan, continues to harbor intent to conduct external operations and maintains English‑language media releases that aim to globalize the group’s local grievances among Western audiences,' U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned in written congressional testimony in October 2023. Even the most recent Homeland Security threat assessment, issued in September, cautioned that IS, with other terror groups such as al-Qaida, 'maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland,' rating the threat level as 'high.' The September assessment further warned that IS online media groups also sought to capitalize on the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East 'to inspire more violent action.' FBI Director Christopher Wray has also said repeatedly that the bureau’s domestic terrorism caseload remains high, with about 1,000 IS-related investigations each year spanning all 50 U.S. states. According to data compiled by Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher faculty member at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, more than 250 individuals have been charged with IS-related activities since 2014. Most of those cases, according to Hughes, have resulted in guilty pleas or convictions; Justice Department prosecutors have only lost one case that went to trial. Meanwhile, the FBI has had success in disrupting IS-linked or inspired terror plots. In October, for example, agents arrested a 27-year-old Afghan national in Oklahoma City, charging him and a juvenile co-conspirator with attempting to carry out a mass shooting on Election Day. IS has so far yet to claim the New Orleans terror attack as its own, but the Washington Institute’s Aaron Zelin said the attack is already generating excitement among IS supporters on social media. Some U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that excitement will play to the terror group’s advantage. 'From their view, it's less important that an attack kills large numbers of people than it simply garners a lot of media attention,' Brett Holmgren, the acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center told a Washington audience in November. Some counterterrorism officials and experts, however, say they worry the attacks could become deadlier. The NCTC has warned IS has been benefiting from improved finances and even set up an external planning unit in Syria, with a focus on carrying out attacks against the U.S. 'All of last year that there was an uptick in the tempo of Islamic State plots and attacks,' Zelin told VOA. 'We saw five attack plots in the United States last year, whereas in 2023 there were none.' That activity may not be limited to America, with some analysts pointing to deadly IS attacks last year in Kerman, Iran, and Moscow. [[ 'It falls in line to a broader trend that we've seen in the U.S., but also in other parts of the world where, you know, we saw more plots and attacks in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia,' Zelin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-group-inspired-new-orleans-attack-revives-familiar-fears/7921742.html	2025-01-01T22:17:11-08:00	
Parts of UK flooded by rain, wild weather disrupts New Year's events	LONDON — Parts of the United Kingdom were flooded Wednesday as heavy rains and powerful winds continued to disrupt New Year’s celebrations. Several communities in the Manchester area were flooded, with several homes evacuated and cars submerged up to their roofs on roads and in parking lots after nearly a month's worth of rain fell in two days. A major incident was declared and mountain rescue teams were called in to help firefighters respond to swamped properties and stranded vehicles, Greater Manchester Police said. 'There’s still probably likely to be further flooding across the course of the day,' Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said. 'We are potentially expecting the flood situation to get worse before it gets better.' Tom Coulthard said the rain started late Tuesday afternoon and poured all night where he lives in Didsbury, south of Manchester, topping river banks and forcing a hotel to be evacuated before dawn. Roads and highways were closed in the area. 'All the local rivers and water courses have sort of filled up and flooded around the area,' said Coulthard, a geography professor at the University of Hull. 'That’s really probably a sign of just how our weather is changing, how climate is shifting.' The deluge and gusts derailed New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations, leading to cancelations in Edinburgh and several other cities. Events planned for New Year's Day, including nippy outdoor swims and a bathtub boat race, were scrapped. London, which was able to launch its massive fireworks display on the River Thames in front of Big Ben, had to postpone the start of its New Year’s Day parade and grounded inflatable floats due to the blustery and soggy conditions. Cheerleaders and members of bands that marched through central London pulled transparent coverings over their bright costumes to take shelter from rain. Warnings that indicate flooding is expected were issued at one point to more than 150 communities across the U.K., with most being in northern England. Later in the day, dozens of those warnings had been lifted. Several trains were canceled because of high water around the tracks and some highways were closed. With temperatures dropping, there were ice warnings until late Thursday morning for Northern Ireland, parts of north Wales, England and Scotland. And a three-day snow warning was issued for the coming weekend for much of England and Scotland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/parts-of-uk-flooded-by-rain-wild-weather-disrupts-new-year-s-events/7921719.html	2025-01-01T20:26:10-08:00

Aspiring nurse, football star, father among dead in New Orleans attack	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — An 18-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a nurse, a father of two and a former Princeton football star suffered fatal injuries when the driver of a white pickup truck sped down Bourbon Street, packed with holiday revelers early Wednesday morning. Officials have not yet released the names of the 15 people killed in the New Orleans New Year's Day truck attack, but their families and friends have started sharing their stories. New Orleans Coroner Dr. Dwight McKenna said in a statement late Wednesday that the names of the dead would be released once autopsies were complete and next of kin were informed. About 30 people were injured. Nikyra Dedeaux Zion Parsons of Gulfport, Mississippi, had been celebrating New Year's Eve during his first night on Bourbon Street when a vehicle appeared and plowed into his friend, 18-year-old Nikyra Dedeaux, who he said had dreamed of becoming a nurse. 'A truck hit the corner and comes barreling through, throwing people like in a movie scene, throwing people into the air,' Parsons, 18, told The Associated Press. 'It hit her and flung her like at least 30 feet, and I was just lucky to be alive.' As the crowd scattered in the chaos, he ran through a gruesome aftermath of bleeding and maimed victims, hearing gunshots and explosive sounds. 'Bodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering,' Parsons said. 'People crying on the floor, like brain matter all over the ground. It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I've ever seen.' Dedeaux was a responsible daughter — shorter than all her siblings but the one who helped take care of everyone, Parsons said. Dedeaux had a job at a hospital and was set to start college and begin working toward her goal of becoming a registered nurse. 'She had her mind set — she didn't have everything figured out, but she had the plan laid down,' Parsons said. Reggie Hunter Reggie Hunter, a 37-year-old father of two from Baton Rouge, had just left work and headed to celebrate New Year's with a cousin when the attack happened, another cousin, Shirell Jackson, told Nola.com. Hunter was killed and his cousin was injured, Jackson said. Tiger Bech A former high school and college football player from Louisiana was among those who died in the attack at New Orleans' French Quarter, according to an education official. Tiger Bech, 28, died late Wednesday morning at a New Orleans hospital, according to local media outlets citing Kim Broussard, the athletic director at St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette. Bech attended the high school, where he played wide receiver, quarterback, punt returner and defensive back, NOLA.com reported. Bech's LinkedIn profile said he had played football at Princeton University before graduating in 2021. Most recently he was working as an investment trader at a New York brokerage firm. Princeton football coach Bob Surace said Wednesday that he had been texting with Bech's father, sharing memories of the player, who was a kick returner and receiver from 2017 to 2019. 'He might be the first Tiger to ever play for us, and that nickname kind of described him as a competitor,' Surace told ESPN. The school's teams are also called the Tigers. 'He was somebody that somehow, like in the key moments, just excelled and was full of energy, full of life.' Bech had been working at Seaport Global, where company spokesperson Lisa Lieberman could not confirm his death. But she told The Associated Press that 'he was extremely well regarded by everybody who knew him.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/aspiring-nurse-football-star-father-among-dead-in-new-orleans-attack-/7921655.html	2025-01-01T16:04:16-08:00	
Pakistan secures peace deal in violence-torn district bordering Afghanistan	islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan announced Wednesday that heavily armed rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes in a conflict-prone district bordering Afghanistan have reached a peace deal following recent deadly clashes. A traditional grand assembly of tribal elders mediated the agreement between the warring sides in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where years-old land disputes have often led to deadly districtwide sectarian clashes, a provincial government spokesperson said in a late-night statement. 'Both sides have agreed to demolish their bunkers and surrender their heavy weapons to authorities,' Muhammad Ali Saif said in a post on X. He stated that anyone found guilty of violating the pact's terms would be apprehended and punished in line with local traditions. Saif congratulated the nearly 800,000 residents of Kurram on the signing of the pact, assuring them the deal would 'soon restore calm and security' and lead to 'peace and development' in the district. The most recent round of violence erupted in the district on November 21, when gunmen ambushed a convoy of vehicles mainly carrying Shiite community members, killing 52 of them. Although no one claimed responsibility for the massacre, it led to retaliatory attacks by Shiite fighters against the Sunni village where the convoy was ambushed, raising the overall death toll to more than 130. The provincial government’s intervention had led to a ceasefire and peace talks between the warring sides, but the persistent tensions compelled authorities to halt all Pakistan traffic to and from the district, disrupting the local population’s access to food, fuel, medicine, work and trade. Saif said the peace deal would allow the roads to the district to reopen, noting that stranded convoys of passengers and supplies were scheduled to resume their journeys on Saturday. Pakistani authorities have been ferrying essential commodities such as food and medicine to Kurram by helicopter, citing the insecurity of travel in overland convoys. Residents complained, however, that the air missions were insufficient in addressing the district border crisis. They have also been staging street protests to press the government to reopen the road links to help overcome the shortages. Kurram is the only Pakistani district where Shiites, not Sunnis, make up the majority of the population. Pakistan’s bilateral and transit trade with landlocked Afghanistan through the Kurram district's Kharlachi border crossing has also been halted because of recent sectarian tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-secures-peace-deal-in-violence-torn-district-bordering-afghanistan-/7921405.html	2025-01-01T15:35:58-08:00	
Gunman kills at least 10 people in shooting rampage in Montenegro	PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO — At least 10 people, including two children, were killed and four others were wounded in a shooting on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl in a western Montenegrin city, officials said. The shooter was on the run. Police identified the attacker as Aco Martinovic, 45. He killed the owner of the bar in the city of Cetinje, the bar owner's children and his own family members, said Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic at a news conference. 'At this moment, we are focused on arresting him,' Saranovic said. Police dispatched special troops to search for the attacker in Cetinje, located about 30 kilometers northwest of the capital, Podgorica. A statement said the man fled the scene armed after opening fire at the bar. President Jakov Milatovic said he was 'shocked and stunned' by the tragedy. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Milatovic said on the social media platform X. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic went to the hospital where the wounded were being treated and announced three days of mourning. 'This is a terrible tragedy that has affected us all,' Spajic said. 'All police teams are out.' Montenegro, which has about 620,000 people, is known for gun culture, and many people traditionally have weapons. Wednesday's attack was the second shooting rampage over the past three years in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital. In August 2022, an attacker also killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje. A report by Radio and Television of Montenegro, the country's public service broadcaster, which published Martinovic's photo on its website, said he was known for erratic behavior and had been detained in the past for illegal possession of weapons. The report said he had gone home to get his gun and returned to the bar, where he had opened fire and killed and wounded several people. He then went to another site where he killed the bar owner's children and a woman, the report added. Police appealed to residents to remain calm and stay indoors, ruling out a clash between criminal gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-kills-at-least-10-people-in-shooting-rampage-in-montenegro-/7921392.html	2025-01-01T14:54:29-08:00	
Tesla truck explodes outside Trump Vegas hotel; 1 killed, 7 injured	las vegas — One person died and seven others were injured Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck that appeared to be carrying fireworks caught fire and exploded outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel, authorities said. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials told a news conference that a person died inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck, and they were working to get the body out. Seven people nearby had minor injuries, and several were taken to a hospital. The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokeswoman said in a statement. According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation. 'I know you have a lot of questions,' Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office, told reporters. 'We don't have a lot of answers.' President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 10 people before he was shot to death by police. 'The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,' Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a statement on X, adding: 'We've never seen anything like this.' In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions. 'The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away,' Bruce said. The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall. Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement 'for their swift response and professionalism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tesla-truck-explodes-outside-trump-vegas-hotel-1-killed-7-injured/7921371.html	2025-01-01T14:11:18-08:00	
Palestinian Authority suspends Al Jazeera broadcasts	WASHINGTON — The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday temporarily suspended Al Jazeera broadcasts across the Palestinian territories, according to media reports. A ministerial committee suspended the broadcaster’s operations over what it described as broadcasting 'inciting material and reports that were deceiving and stirring strife' in the territories. The committee included the culture, interior and communications ministries. The Qatari-owned Al Jazeera came under criticism last week by the Palestinian Authority over its coverage of the weeks-long standoff between Palestinian security forces and militant fighters in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Fatah, the political faction that controls the Palestinian Authority, said the broadcaster was fostering division in 'our Arab homeland in general and in Palestine in particular.' It encouraged Palestinians to not cooperate with the network. Last week, Al Jazeera condemned what it described as an 'incitement campaign' initiated by Fatah against Al Jazeera and its reporters over their coverage of clashes between Palestinian security forces and militant fighters in Jenin. 'Al Jazeera has successfully maintained its professionalism throughout its coverage of the unfolding events in Jenin,' Al Jazeera said in the statement. The Palestinian Authority’s decision to suspend Al Jazeera isn’t expected to be implemented in Hamas-run Gaza, where the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority does not exercise power. Al Jazeera did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. This suspension is the latest of several recent challenges that Al Jazeera has faced in the occupied West Bank and Israel. In September 2024, Israeli soldiers raided Al Jazeera’s Ramallah office in the occupied West Bank and ordered the bureau to shut down operations. And in May 2024, the Israeli government shutdown Al Jazeera in Israel over national security concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-authority-suspends-al-jazeera-broadcasts/7921366.html	2025-01-01T14:05:09-08:00	
Protesters in Syria call for justice for disappeared activists	A few dozen protesters gathered in the Syrian city of Douma on Wednesday to demand answers in the disappearance of four prominent activists who were abducted more than a decade ago. The demonstrators called on Syria’s new rulers — the Islamist-led rebels who seized power last month — to investigate what happened to them. The disappeared activists in question are Razan Zaitouneh, her husband, Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. On Dec. 9, 2013, unidentified gunmen stormed the Violations Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and abducted the four activists. At the time, Douma was held by rebels. There has been no sign of life nor proof of death since they were abducted. Zaitouneh was one of Syria’s most prominent human rights activists, in part because she documented abuses by then-President Bashar al-Assad’s government and rebel groups in equal measure. Her work earned her international recognition, including an International Woman of Courage Award presented by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. At the Wednesday protest, demonstrators held up photos of the missing activists. 'We are here because we want to know the whole truth about two women and two men who were disappeared from this place 11 years and 22 days ago,' said activist Yassin Al-Haj Saleh, whose wife, Khalil, was among those abducted. 'We are gathering here to remind the world of their case,' he added. 'This is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.' Since the Assad government was ousted last month, protests have occurred across the Middle Eastern country calling for information about the thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared under Assad’s rule. Syria’s transitional government — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the ouster of Assad — has been neutral regarding accusations against various armed groups of forcibly disappearing activists. HTS has also aligned with activists in their efforts to seek truth and justice. 'We are here because we want the truth. The truth about their fate and justice for them, so that we may heal our wounds,' said Alaa al-Merhi, Khalil’s niece. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, but signs point to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time. The group has long denied involvement. Zaitouneh had received threats from both the government and rebels before she went missing. Friends and activists have said some of the threats can be traced to the Army of Islam. Protesters on Wednesday held banners accusing the Army of Islam of the abduction. 'We have enough evidence to incriminate Jaish al-Islam, and we have the names of suspects we would like to see investigated,' Haj Saleh said. He said he wanted 'the perpetrators to be tried by the Syrian courts.' The Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It is excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-in-syria-call-for-justice-for-disappeared-activists/7921345.html	2025-01-01T13:34:13-08:00	
Power restored to nearly all of Puerto Rico after major blackout	BAYAMON, PUERTO RICO — Power was restored to nearly all electrical customers across Puerto Rico on Wednesday after a sweeping blackout plunged the U.S. territory into darkness on New Year's Eve. By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico's 1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company supplying power to the archipelago. Lights returned to households as well as Puerto Rico's hospitals and water and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island. Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days. 'Given the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages,' Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement. The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory. Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who is set to take office Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum capacity. 'These days, I urge you to be moderate with your energy consumption to help reduce load shifting, so that more people can have access to electricity and the system can start up without any major setbacks,' Gonzalez-Colon said on the X social media platform. On the campaign trail, Gonzalez-Colon promised to appoint an 'energy czar' to oversee the operation of the power grid, which has long been fragile and faulty due to years of neglect. The island's power lines were ravaged in September 2017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. Unreliable electricity remains frustratingly common, hindering daily life for Puerto Ricans. In June, over 340,000 customers were left without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. In August, at the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, over half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm. The New Year's Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/power-restored-to-nearly-all-of-puerto-rico-after-major-blackout/7921342.html	2025-01-01T13:28:30-08:00	
China-backed election raises fears of 'negative peace' in Myanmar	WASHINGTON — As Myanmar’s military government prepares for elections in 2025, attention turns to neighboring China, which, critics say, is pressuring Southeast Asian nations to treat the vote as a solution to Myanmar’s ongoing political crisis. A military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 overthrew the democratically elected government and triggered a civil war that left thousands of people dead and millions displaced. Myanmar’s neighbors have been seeking a solution to the crisis and recently held meetings in Bangkok, Thailand, to discuss it. China was a participant at a Dec. 19 meeting that included Bangladesh, India, Laos and Thailand. All five countries are neighbors of Myanmar. At the meeting, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong urged the neighbors’ representatives to support Myanmar’s 'peace and reconciliation,' according to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry. 'All parties should respect Myanmar’s national conditions and ... prioritize people’s livelihoods,' Sun said. At the Dec. 19 meeting, Than Swe, Myanmar’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, outlined the junta’s 2025 election roadmap. Opposition groups, including ethnic armed forces and the National Unity Government, or NUG, a parallel government formed after the 2021 coup, rejected the plan, questioning its legitimacy and whether the elections would be free and fair. On Dec. 20, there was a meeting of all representatives of ASEAN countries, except Myanmar because junta political appointees usually have been barred from attending high-level meetings of the bloc since the coup. Thai Foreign Ministry official Bolbongse Vangphaen said the bloc still awaits details of the proposed ballot, which China backs. Myanmar’s military leadership did not respond to VOA's request for comment regarding the Bangkok meetings, controversies surrounding its proposed elections or its preparations for the polls. China maintains close ties with Myanmar's military and the rebel groups near its border. In his recent Christmas and New Year’s messages, Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, reiterated and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to 'strengthening the multiparty democratic system and returning to the correct democratic path.' VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar for comment on China’s support for the election in Myanmar but has not received a response. However, during a visit to Myanmar’s capital, Naypyidaw, in mid-August by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Beijing called for an 'all-inclusive election,' according to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. Skeptics argue that any election carried out by the junta would lead only to a superficial peace that ignores decadeslong political and ethnic grievances. China’s growing sway Experts told VOA that Beijing is urging ASEAN members to deepen their engagement with Myanmar’s military. According to Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace, China is pressuring its Southeast Asian neighbors to accept the junta’s election as a quick solution. 'From China’s vantage point, if ASEAN is bringing the regime back in and is having higher-level interactions, it legitimizes what China is doing,' Tower said. Myanmar expert Htet Min Lwin of York University in Canada said Beijing prefers leveraging its influence over that of Western intervention. 'If the resolution goes through ASEAN, where China holds considerable influence, Beijing will likely keep pushing an ASEAN-led path,' he told VOA. Sai Kyi Zin Soe, a regionally based Myanmar political analyst, agreed. 'Some ASEAN member countries will not be able to overcome China’s influence, economically or in terms of security,' he said. 'China’s power doesn’t stop at ASEAN; it also extends to domestic groups, including ethnic armed groups in Myanmar, which are now controlling almost all the border areas with China and are traditionally closely tied to China. Tower, meanwhile, sees 'no viable plan' for a political solution and said Beijing views Myanmar’s generals as 'completely cornered' and open to 'significant concessions' that could jeopardize sovereignty, including allowing Chinese troops to protect investments. 'China has been strong-arming two of the northern ethnic armed organizations into talks with the regime,' Tower said. 'Chinese influence continues to rise, and [Beijing] is exerting that influence on other countries in the region, trying to get those countries to follow along.' He warned the junta 'is bankrupt when it comes to a real solution,' instead relying on 'airstrikes, forced conscription and a sham election to legitimize junta leader Min Aung Hlaing.' Tower predicted ASEAN would eventually realize the military’s steady decline. Mounting battlefield losses The junta’s China-backed electoral push comes amid a series of defeats. 'The military is losing ground at an alarming pace and is desperate,' Tower said. Tower believes that after the fall of two major regional commands, Myanmar’s weakened military has no alternative but to trade away parts of its sovereignty to China. 'It’s making major concessions,' he said, citing China’s proposed joint venture security company. 'For China, this turns Myanmar into a testing ground for its Global Security Initiative and new approaches to secure interests beyond its borders.' In October, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or the Kokang group, part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance along with the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, captured the city of Lashio in northern Shan State. Lashio is considered strategic for the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, marking the first time in modern Myanmar history that a regional command fell to rebels. On Dec. 20, the Arakan Army seized the junta’s western regional command in Rakhine state, an area rich in natural gas that includes major Chinese projects. Video on social media shows emaciated junta troops surrendering. Tower said it was an 'embarrassment of an army.' 'The bottom line is increasing desperation,' Tower said, adding that this explains why Myanmar’s military is ceding sovereignty to China, including the potential deployment of Chinese private security troops in Rakhine state. Concerns of 'negative peace' Analysts say an election without real dialogue will yield a fragile ceasefire. 'All the neighboring countries, including China, cannot understand that each ethnic group in Myanmar has its own right to rule and sovereignty,' Htet Min Lwin said. Sai Kyi Zin Soe noted, citing World Bank and United Nations data, that 42 million of Myanmar’s 53 million people now live in poverty. He said the humanitarian crisis could push many armed groups to pause fighting but not necessarily resolve the conflict. 'If the international community pushes them, the war may stop, and the election will happen,' Sai Kyi Zin Soe said. 'However, it will not be a solution that benefits Myanmar in the long term. It needs to be understood that only negative peace will prevail.' Tower told VOA there may be opportunities this year for ASEAN to expand its role, but China’s involvement, especially in border areas, could overshadow that. 'If other countries don’t take careful note of Chinese interference,' he said, 'the response in Myanmar tilts more toward where Beijing is headed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backed-election-raises-fears-of-negative-peace-in-myanmar/7921313.html	2025-01-01T12:43:26-08:00	
Press freedom groups call for Iran to release jailed Italian journalist	WASHINGTON — Press freedom groups and media organizations are calling for Iran to release an Italian journalist who was arrested last month. Cecilia Sala, who works for the daily Italian newspaper Il Foglio, was arrested on Dec. 19 and is being held in Iran's notorious Evin prison. The 29-year-old was reporting in Iran on a journalist visa and was due to return to Italy on Dec. 20. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said Sala's jailing underscores Tehran's harsh suppression of independent journalism in the country. 'Sala's arrest is a powerful reminder of the daily threats faced by those reporting in and about Iran, and she and all those wrongfully detained by Iran should be released immediately,' CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg said Tuesday in a statement. Iran ranks seventh among the world's top jailers of journalists. As of Dec. 1, 2024, 16 journalists were jailed in the country, according to CPJ data. Iran confirmed Sala's detention on Monday when the state news outlet IRNA reported that she was being held after 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.' Sala, who also works for the podcast company Chora Media, is being held in solitary confinement, according to media reports. The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Meloni was 'following the complex affair' closely and pursuing 'all possible avenues of dialogue' to release Sala. Italy's foreign minister said Sala was in good health and that negotiations were under way to bring her home. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said Sala appeared to have been arbitrarily detained. 'We are also concerned about her conditions of detention as she is held in solitary confinement in Evin prison — infamous for being the cruel place where free voices critical of the regime are detained,' RSF Director General Thibaut Bruttin said Tuesday in a statement. The National Press Club in Washington condemned Sala's solitary confinement. 'Sala's imprisonment is a chilling reminder of the risks journalists face in pursuit of the truth,' President Emily Wilkins said in a statement last week. 'Her detention is an affront to press freedom and a violation of international norms.' Sala's arrest came just a few days after Italy arrested Swiss Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini Najafabadi, known as Abedini, in Milan at the request of the United States. The businessman is accused of breaking U.S. sanctions laws and providing support to a foreign terrorist organization, which ultimately led to the deaths of three U.S. service members in a drone attack in Jordan, according to the U.S. Justice Department. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that they believe Sala's arrest is likely a response to Najafabadi's arrest. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-groups-call-for-iran-to-release-jailed-italian-journalist/7921326.html	2025-01-01T12:39:04-08:00	
Israel's former defense chief Gallant quits parliament	JERUSALEM — Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who had often taken an independent line against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government allies, said on Wednesday he was resigning from parliament. Gallant was fired from the government in November by Netanyahu, after months of disagreements over the conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza, but he kept his seat as an elected member of the Knesset. 'Just as it is on the battlefield, so it is in public service. There are moments in which one must stop, assess and choose a direction in order to achieve the goals,' Gallant said in a televised statement. Gallant had often broken ranks with Netanyahu and his coalition allies of far-right and religious parties, including over exemptions granted to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from serving in the conscript military — a hot button issue. In March 2023, Netanyahu fired Gallant after he urged a halt to a highly contested government plan to cut the Supreme Court's powers. His dismissal triggered mass protests and Netanyahu backtracked. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Gallant and Netanyahu, along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict, which Israel has contested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-former-defense-chief-gallant-quits-parliament/7921315.html	2025-01-01T12:29:37-08:00	
Pope calls for commitment to protect life by rejecting abortion in New Year message	ROME — Pope Francis ushered in the New Year with a renewed appeal for the faithful to reject abortion, calling for a 'firm commitment' to protect and respect life from conception to natural death. Francis, 88, celebrated a New Year’s Day Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday that was dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus. In his homily, he prayed that everyone learns to care for 'every child born of a woman' and to protect 'the precious gift of life: life in the womb, the lives of children, the lives of the suffering, the poor, the elderly, the lonely and the dying.' 'I ask for a firm commitment to respect the dignity of human life from conception to natural death, so that each person may cherish his or her own life and all may look with hope to the future,' he said, using the terminology of the church's opposition to abortion and euthanasia. In recent years, the Argentine Jesuit has been speaking out more emphatically about abortion than he did at the start of his pontificate. After two doctrinaire popes, Francis complained in the first months of his papacy in 2013 that the church had become obsessed by 'small-minded rules' about hot-button issues such as abortion. Francis now regularly refers to procuring an abortion as 'hiring a hitman to solve a problem.' He recently sparked outrage in Belgium when he criticized its abortion law as 'homicidal' and announced he wanted to beatify Belgium's late king who abdicated for a day rather than approve legislation legalizing the procedure. The Vatican recently announced that the beatification process is under way for King Baudouin, who died in 1993. The morning Mass marked the final big event of Francis' busy Christmas schedule. For the pope, who suffers from recurrent respiratory problems, this year's season was even more challenging with the start of the Vatican's big Holy Year, a once-every-quarter-century celebration of the faith that is expected to bring 32 million pilgrims to Rome during 2025. Speaking to pilgrims who gathered in a sun-filled St. Peter's Square, Francis recalled the Jubilee's central message of the need to forgive debts. He again called for world leaders from wealthy countries to eliminate or reduce the debts owed by poorer countries. Francis urged Christian leaders, in particular, 'to provide a good example' by taking the lead to forgive debts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-calls-for-commitment-to-protect-life-by-rejecting-abortion-in-new-year-message/7921229.html	2025-01-01T11:08:34-08:00	
Human rights plummet in Ukraine, Russian-occupied territories	Geneva — U.N. human rights monitors find that almost three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the human rights situation in the country and areas occupied by Russia is on a downward spiral, as military operations intensify, civilian casualties rise, and torture, summary executions and other gross violations proliferate. 'The human rights situation remains bleak with a still-rising number of civilian casualties, continued executions and torture of prisoners of war, and efforts by Russia to solidify its control of occupied Ukrainian territory,' according to the new report by the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, HRMMU. The report, released Tuesday by the U.N. Human Rights Office, covers key developments in the human rights situation between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, 2024. It’s based on information gathered in the course of dozens of field trips and visits to detention centers, as well as interviews with more than 800 victims and witnesses of human rights violations. 'Behind each of the facts and figures in this report are stories of loss and human suffering, showing the devastating impact of the war across Ukraine,' said HRMUU chief Danielle Bell in a statement issued from Kyiv to coincide with the release of the report. She said HRMMU teams documented 574 civilian deaths, and more than 3,000 civilians injured over the three-month period, adding that September marked the highest monthly casualty toll since July 2022. The report attributes the surge in civilian deaths primarily to 'intensified military operations' by Russian armed forces, especially in Kherson, Donetsk and other Russian government-controlled areas of Kharkiv. 'The use of aerial glide bombs and short-range drones contributed to the high number of civilian casualties and harm to communities,' the report says, noting that in mid-November, Russian armed forces began conducting large-scale coordinated aerial attacks against Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure. 'The attacks disrupted electricity and dependent services such as water, heating, and transportation services in multiple regions,' it says, 'further diminishing Ukraine’s energy capacity as winter approached.' There was no immediate response to the report from Russian or Ukrainian officials. A spokeswoman for the U.N. Human Rights Office tells VOA the office 'sent the report to the Russian Federation in advance of its publication, as per usual practice. We did not receive any comments from them.' Ukrainian POWs subjected to sexual violence The report finds torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war in the hands of the Russian Federation, 'has been widespread and systematic.' It says 42 recently released Ukrainian POWs have presented 'credible and detailed accounts' of torture they had experienced, 'including beatings, electric shock, and prolonged solitary confinement' during their captivity. It says the use of sexual violence is prevalent against both women and men, with many being subjected to 'rape, electric shocks and beating to genitals, forced nudity, and threats of rape and castration.' Since the end of August, U.N. monitors have recorded a significant increase in 'credible allegations of executions of Ukrainian POWs,' involving the killing of 62 individuals in 19 incidents. The U.N. human rights office has verified 'the execution of 15 Ukrainian servicemen.' While Russian POWs also have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment by Ukrainian authorities, authors of the report say this has occurred to a much lesser extent and predominantly while prisoners 'were held in transit facilities during the early stages of captivity.' It adds that the Human Rights Office documented the death of one Russian POW at a transit facility in early 2024 caused by torture and is looking into the deaths of two other Russian POWs under similar circumstances. The report also examines the treatment of civilians in territory occupied by the Russian Federation in Ukraine and in Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014. Imposing Russian identity Authors of the report accuse Russia of entrenching its control in the occupied territory through the imposition of Russian laws, in violation of its obligations under international humanitarian law, 'resulting in further restrictions to fundamental rights and freedoms, property ownership, and cultural rights.' They cite the example of a new strategy adopted by the Russian authorities in September 'to compel Ukrainian children and youth in occupied territory to demonstrate loyalty to the Russian Federation.' The strategy involves the training of children in military skills as part of their summer recreational activities and the use of propaganda in education. 'Over the 2024 summer, Russian occupying authorities sent children from occupied territory of Ukraine to camps in Crimea and in the Russian Federation, where both girls and boys received military training and participated in activities focused on reinforcement of Russian patriotism and identity,' in violation of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law, they say. The report lambasts the Russian Federation as the occupying authority for restricting religious freedom and for restricting freedom of expression 'to silence criticism of Russian military actions.' The report also finds fault with provisions adopted by the Ukrainian government in the territories they control that 'prohibit the activities of Ukrainian religious organizations affiliated with counterparts in the Russian Federation.' These provisions, the authors say, disproportionately restrict the free expression of one’s religion or belief and 'should be amended to align fully with international human rights law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-plummet-in-ukraine-russian-occupied-territories/7921152.html	2025-01-01T09:43:45-08:00	
Harry Chandler, Navy medic who survived Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, dies at 103	HONOLULU — Harry Chandler, a Navy medic who helped pull injured sailors from the oily waters of Pearl Harbor after the 1941 Japanese attack on the naval base, has died. He was 103. Chandler died Monday at a senior living center in Tequesta, Florida, according to Ron Mahaffee, the husband of his granddaughter Kelli Fahey. Chandler had congestive heart failure, but Mahaffee said doctors and nurses noted his advanced age when giving a cause of death. The third Pearl Harbor survivor to die in the past few weeks, Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class on Dec. 7, 1941, when waves of Japanese fighter planes dropped bombs and fired machine guns on battleships in the harbor and plunged the U.S. into World War II. He told The Associated Press in 2023 that he saw the planes approach as he was raising the flag that morning at a mobile hospital in Aiea Heights, which is in the hills overlooking the base. 'I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the bombs dropping,' Chandler said. His first instinct was to take cover and 'get the hell out of here.' 'I was afraid that they’d start strafing,' he said. His unit rode trucks down to attend to the injured. He said in a Pacific Historic Parks oral history interview that he boarded a boat to help pluck wounded sailors from the water. The harbor was covered in oil from exploding ships, so Chandler washed the sailors off after lifting them out. He said he was too focused on his work to be afraid. 'It got so busy you weren't scared. Weren’t scared at all. We were busy. It was after you got scared,' Chandler said. He realized later that he could have been killed, 'But you didn’t think about that while you were busy taking care of people.' The attack killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank nine minutes after it was bombed. Chandler's memories came flowing back when he visited Pearl Harbor for a 2023 ceremony commemorating the 82nd anniversary of the bombing. 'I look out there, and I can still see what’s going on. I can still see what was happening,' Chandler told The Associated Press. Asked what he wanted Americans to know about Pearl Harbor, he said: 'Be prepared.' 'We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has to be better,' he said. After the war Chandler worked as a painter and wallpaper hanger and bought an upholstery business with his brother. He also joined the Navy reserves, retiring as a senior chief in 1981. Chandler was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and lived for most of his adult life in nearby South Hadley, Mahaffee said. In recent decades he split his time between Massachusetts and Florida. An avid golfer, he shot five hole-in-ones during his lifetime, his grandson-in-law added. Chandler had one biological daughter and adopted two daughters from his second marriage, to Anna Chandler, who died in 2004. He is survived by two daughters, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated that there were some 87,000 military personnel on the island of Oahu on the day of the attack. With Chandler’s death, only 15 are still living, according to a tally maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Bob Fernandez, who served on the USS Curtiss, also died this month, at age 100, and Warren Upton, 105, who served on the USS Utah, died last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harry-chandler-navy-medic-who-survived-japan-s-attack-on-pearl-harbor-dies-at-103-/7921016.html	2025-01-01T08:51:33-08:00	
Trump says he plans to attend Jimmy Carter's funeral	PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's planning to attend the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter. Asked about it as he walked into a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump responded, 'I'll be there.' Pressed on whether he'd spoken to members of Carter's family, Trump said he'd rather not say. Funeral services honoring Carter, who died Sunday at 100, will be held in Georgia and Washington, beginning Jan. 4 and concluding Jan. 9. Trump was a frequent and fierce critic of Carter on the campaign trail ahead of November's election, using the rising inflation rates of the 1970s to unfavorably compare President Joe Biden to Carter and his administration. The president-elect was gracious about the former president, though, in posts on his social media site after Carter's death Sunday, writing that the nation 'owed him a debt of gratitude.' 'While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,' Trump wrote of Carter. 'He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.' Wearing a tuxedo as he entered the festivities, Trump took a few minutes of questions from reporters on various topics. He was asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza but said only, 'We’re going to see what happens.' Of hostages seized more than a year ago by Hamas, the president-elect said, 'I’ll put it this way: They better let the hostages come back soon.' Trump also said he thought 2025 would be a 'great year' and 'we’re going to do fantastically well as a country.' 'There’s a whole light over the whole world, not just our country. They’re a lot of happy people,' Trump said of recent weeks. Asked about his resolutions for the new year, Trump said, 'I just want everybody to be happy, healthy and well.' Trump later took the stage to briefly address the crowd ringing in the new year at Mar-a-Lago and promised 'to do a great job as your president.' Biden, for his part, spent New Year’s Eve celebrating the wedding of his niece Missy Owens in Greenville, Delaware, followed by the reception in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Biden and first lady Jill Biden cut short their traditional holiday trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands to attend the ceremony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-is-planning-to-attend-jimmy-carter-s-funeral/7921035.html	2025-01-01T08:10:52-08:00

10 dead, 30 injured after car plows into crowd in New Orleans	NEW ORLEANS — Ten people were killed and 30 injured when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Year's Day, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness agency. New Orleans police earlier said they were responding to a mass casualty incident, including fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area. It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals. The incident came toward the end of New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the Allstate Sugar Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Caesars Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-30-injured-after-car-plows-into-crowd-in-new-orleans/7920830.html	2025-01-01T04:33:39-08:00	
Deadly Israeli airstrikes hit northern, central Gaza	Palestinian officials said Wednesday that Israeli airstrikes in northern and central Gaza killed at least 15 people. One of the strikes hit a house in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, while another hit the Bureij refugee camp in the center of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s military did not immediate comment on the attacks, but earlier Wednesday, it warned people to evacuate the Bureij area, saying militants located there were firing rockets. Israel has repeatedly told people to move from parts of Gaza in what the military says are evacuations necessary for safely carrying out its war against Hamas militants. The United Nations and humanitarian organizations have criticized the Israeli tactic, saying the evacuation orders often give people little time to leave and that they do not have safe places to go in Gaza to escape the airstrikes and Israeli ground operations. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. About 100 hostages are being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror organization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-israeli-airstrikes-hit-northern-central-gaza/7920772.html	2025-01-01T02:25:52-08:00	
Russian gas supplies through Ukraine end	Russian gas exports crossing through Ukraine were halted Wednesday with the expiration of a transit agreement. The development will force some European nations to find alternative sources of gas with the interruption of the decades-old route. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine had already prompted many in the European Union to cut their dependence on Russian gas. 'We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses. Europe has already made the decision to abandon Russian gas,' Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in a statement. Russian gas giant Gazprom said it lost the 'technical and legal right' to send its gas through Ukraine. Russia is still able to export gas to Turkey and central European nations such as Hungary and Serbia. Moldova’s government, meanwhile, has ordered sharp cuts in energy consumption to deal with its loss of Russian supply. The European Union played down the impact on its member states, saying, 'The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin' to central and eastern Europe. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-gas-supplies-through-ukraine-end/7920765.html	2025-01-01T02:00:39-08:00	
Russian drone attack injures 6 in Kyiv	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Wednesday a Russian drone attack injured at least six people. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, said on Telegram that the attack damaged multiple buildings and a tram track. In Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said Russia attacked with artillery, rockets and drones, damaging seven houses and a medical center. Officials in the Cherkasy and Mykolaiv regions reported that Ukrainian air defenses shot down several Russian drones overnight. Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday it destroyed a Ukrainian drone over the Kursk region. In neighboring Bryansk, the regional governor said Russian air defenses destroyed two drones, and that there were no casualties or damage. In a New Year's Eve address to his nation Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would do everything it could in the new year to end the war with Russia. 'And every day in the coming year, I, and all of us, must fight for a Ukraine that is strong enough. Because only such a Ukraine is respected and heard, both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,' Zelenskyy said. 'May 2025 be our year. The year of Ukraine. We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war. This is what each of us wishes for,' he added. In 2024, Ukraine gave up seven times more ground than it did in 2023: about 4,000 square kilometers, mostly in the east, according to data from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. At the same time, Ukraine took several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Celebrated South African contemporary dancer Dada Masilo dies at 39	JOHANNESBURG — The dance world mourned Tuesday the internationally acclaimed South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo, who died in the hospital over the weekend at age 39. Masilo died unexpectedly on Sunday after a brief illness, a spokesperson for her family said in a statement. Born in Soweto, she was described as a sprite-like, energetic dancer and a fearless rule-breaker, who brought African dance motifs to classic European roles in a career that spanned two decades. 'Deeply respectful of European and contemporary music traditions, but unafraid to go bare on stage and voice her own opinions, she effectively changed the shape and appearance of contemporary dance in South Africa,' family spokesperson Bridget van Oerle said in the statement, announcing her death. Among the most recent in a series of acknowledgements of her work, Masilo in September received the Positano Leonide Massine lifetime achievement award for classic and contemporary dance, which praised her as 'powerful and topical.' Her revisited versions of the great classics of romantic ballet drew on African dance to speak of the society in which she lived and of tolerance across borders, the award announcement said. 'A brilliant light has been extinguished,' the Joburg Ballet company said, praising Masilo's 'creative force as a choreographer and her wisdom as a human being.' 'Her groundbreaking work reshaped the world of contemporary dance, and her spirit will continue to inspire generations of artists and audiences,' the University of Johannesburg's arts and culture department said. The U.K.-based Dance Consortium, which toured with Masilo in Britain twice, called her death a 'tragic loss to the dance world.' 'Her fresh perspective, extraordinary presence and stunning creations wowed and inspired audiences and artists across the U.K. and around the world,' it said. 'Extraordinary role model' Masilo was best known for her iconic re-invention of the great ballet classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle, said Lliane Loots, artistic director at the JOMBA! dance center at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. She used her 'remarkable skill as a ballet dancer' to meld this European dance form 'with the rhythms and intentions of her own histories of African dance and of being South African,' Loots said. In 2016, Masilo's Swan Lake was nominated for a New York Bessie Award and the following year her Giselle won Best Performance by the Italian Danza and Danza Award, the family statement said. In 2018, she won the Netherlands’ Prince Claus Next Generation award, where she was described as an 'extraordinary role model for young people and girls.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/celebrated-south-african-contemporary-dancer-dada-masilo-dies-at-39-/7920746.html	2025-01-01T00:20:40-08:00	
Taiwan's president says Beijing remains the obstacle for resuming cross-strait exchanges	Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te reiterated his administration’s willingness to welcome equal and dignified exchanges with China but said Beijing remains the obstacle for both sides to resume regular exchanges. 'Taiwan hopes to have healthy and orderly exchanges with China under the principle of reciprocal dignity, and [Beijing] can cooperate with Taiwan openly and generously,' Lai said during his first New Year address since becoming president in May 2024. He added that China’s attempt to weaken Taiwan’s democracy would only be 'counterproductive' to conducting cross-strait exchanges and earning Taiwanese people’s trust. Lai said Beijing is blocking civil society exchanges across the Taiwan Strait by restricting Chinese tourists from visiting the island or preventing Chinese students from studying in Taiwan. 'From this, we can see that the real obstacle to cross-strait exchanges is China, not Taiwan,' he told journalists gathering at the presidential office in Taipei. Apart from addressing cross-strait dynamics, Lai warned about the threat that authoritarian countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose to the rules-based international order. 'Authoritarian regimes continue to cooperate and threaten the rule-based international order, seriously affecting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,' he said, adding that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a 'necessary element' for global security and prosperity. 'Taiwan must be prepared for danger even in times of peace, continue to enhance its defense budget, strengthen its defense capabilities, and showcase the determination to defend itself,' Lai added. Lai’s speech comes as China continues to increase military pressure against Taiwan. Since he took office last May, China has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan and increased the frequency of deploying military aircraft and naval vessels to waters and airspaces near the island. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunify with the island, through force if necessary. During his New Year address on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the message that Beijing’s efforts to reunify with Taipei cannot be stopped. 'No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times,' Xi said in his 10-minute televised address. Analysts say Lai is trying to create 'a new narrative' about relations between Taiwan and China by highlighting the collective threat that authoritarian countries pose to democracies around the world. 'He is grouping China with other authoritarian regimes and portraying China as a threat to the democratic world, in which Taiwan is a member,' said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. 'This new narrative not only aims to highlight and promote Taiwan's separate identity from China but is also geared towards winning international support for Taiwan's de facto independence,' he told VOA in a written response. During his roughly 20-minute speech, the Taiwanese president said the island will continue to defend democracy and its democratic way of life under his leadership. 'Regardless of the threats and challenges to Taiwan, democracy is the only way for us and there is no turning back,' Lai said. 'The safer Taiwan is, the safer the world will be, and the stronger Taiwan is; the stronger the world's democratic defenses will be,' he added. Zhu said Lai’s rhetoric is unlikely to soften Beijing’s pressure and intimidation against Taiwan in 2025. 'He highlighted the importance of strengthening Taiwan’s ability to deter Beijing’s invasion, combating information and cognitive warfare, raising Taiwan’s defense budget, and boosting its military power,' he told VOA. 'This is not music to Beijing’s ears and Beijing’s view that Lai is a diehard separatist is unlikely to change, which means that official contacts between the two sides are unlikely to resume in the near future,' Zhu added. Focus on economic diplomacy in 2025 To highlight Taiwan’s efforts to deepen engagement with like-minded democracies, Lai said Taiwan has redirected investments to democratic countries, including Japan and the United States, in recent years. 'Taiwan's investment in the U.S., Japan, and Europe has risen sharply, significantly surpassing that in China,' he said, adding that the trend shows Taipei’s efforts reduce reliance on a single market. Additionally, Lai said Taiwan will utilize its advantages in the semiconductor and AI sector to strengthen the resilience of the 'democratic supply chain' with democracies around the world. Taiwan needs to 'master advanced technologies and promote diversified development so that Taiwan can continue to lead the advancement of the global democratic supply chain and also ensure the security and stability of the global democratic supply chain,' he added. Experts say these signals show that Taiwan will focus on deepening relations with other democratic countries through economic diplomacy in 2025. 'From his speech, we can see the core of Taiwan’s economic diplomacy is democracy, and based on this principle, Taiwan can use its strength in advanced technologies to deepen relations with like-minded countries,' Hung Chin-fu, a political science professor at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. Hung said as China struggles to boost its sluggish economy and Lai continues to portray Taiwan as part of the democratic world, relations between Beijing and Taipei are not likely to improve in 2025. 'China’s military intimidation against Taiwan will likely continue in 2025 because Beijing needs to use it as a distraction from the ongoing economic downturn the country is experiencing,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-says-beijing-remains-the-obstacle-for-resuming-cross-strait-exchanges/7920716.html	2024-12-31T21:40:18-08:00

Tigray leader says region losing gold without benefit	Ethiopia’s prime minister recently touted the country’s mining resources and said the industry could achieve a historic milestone by generating up to $2 billion in gold revenue this year. He made the comment while inaugurating a gold exploration and mining factory in the Gambella Region. On Dec. 10, Abiy Ahmed reported that Ethiopia’s economy is 'one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa and a beacon of opportunity on the continent.' 'Among its many thriving sectors, the gold mining industry stands out as a significant driver of growth, presenting immense potential for both local and international investment,' he said on social media. But officials in Tigray, one of the richest gold mining regions in Ethiopia, say they are losing resources without benefit for their region at a time when Tigray is trying to recover from two years of brutal war between local rebels and the federal government. The interim president of Tigray, Getachew Reda, speaking on Nov 15 said during the three and half months prior (August, September and October) '28.25 quintals of Gold entered into the Federal Government.' 'The government has not received a single penny,' he said. Ethiopia’s Commercial Bank, through its branch in Shire Inda Selasse, the hub of the gold in Tigray, recently bought $132 million worth of gold in just three months, according to branch manager Tekie Giday. The Tigray region’s entire budget for this year is nearly $100 million. Officials in Tigray said the region is struggling with budget shortfalls as it attempts to bring back services discontinued or destroyed during the war. Environmental fears In addition to lack of economic benefits, officials in Tigray reported that gold mining has exposed some of the region’s residents to dangerous chemicals like mercury and cyanide, which are used for extracting gold. Residents living close to the mining fields say the chemicals have been harmful to humans and livestock, with reports of deformed skin on cows and degraded farmland, witnesses and officials said. Some residents in Tigray’s Northwest region have gone to the courts seeking justice, to get judges to act against goldminers, who they accuse of polluting the environment and causing ill health to their children. The president of the High Court of the Northwest, Judge Mengistu Teklay, told VOA that chemicals used by miners are becoming the source of health, security and stability concerns. 'Utilizations of natural resources must be governed by law and order. It shouldn’t benefit the few individuals,' Mengistu said. 'Those individuals who benefit from these resources should not be allowed to bring safety concerns, existential threats, and health concerns to the unbenefited public.' Cyanide and mercury have both been used during the mining process in Tigray, according to multiple interviews conducted by VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. The World Health Organization identifies mercury as one of the top 10 chemicals or chemical groups posing public health concerns. Alarmed by the use of the chemicals, Ethiopia’s Bureau of Innovation and Technology, a government body tasked with overseeing the country’s science and technological development, asked Tigrayan regional government institutions to take action to prevent unsafe use of the chemicals. Gizachew Weldetsadik Beyene is director of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Department in Tigray’s Bureau of Innovation and Technology. He said a team from the bureau posing as traditional miners traveled to the mining areas and saw what he called a 'sad' situation. 'It is so scary,' Gizachew said, sharing a video of a cow affected by the chemicals, and pictures of women washing the soil using chemicals in search of gold without safety protocols and with their bare hands. 'We’ve seen the damage to animals, to the land, the soil, to people who use running water and suffer, with their skin damaged, the animals which are drinking that water and exposed to dangerous diseases,' Gizachew said. Action taken The Tigray region’s Cabinet this week called for a halt to goldmining. The announcement was made by the deputy president of Tigray’s interim administration, Lieutenant General Tsadkan Gebretinsae. He did not elaborate about when the suspension will start and how the measure will be implemented. Prior to that, the Tigray Communication Affairs Bureau said in a statement that action was taken against people who were using illegal dangerous chemicals to process gold in Tahtay Koraro district near a dam that is a source of potable water for the city of Shire Inda Selasse. No details were given about the actions and the type of chemicals used. A security source who requested anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media alleged that foreign companies are working with Ezana Mining Development, a local mining company. The head of Ezana company, Tesfatsion Desta, did not initially respond to VOA calls. After a VOA Tigrigna Service radio report aired, Ezana put out a statement saying it was not asked to comment on the story, which it called 'distorted.' In the statement, Ezana said it worked with foreign companies before the Tigray war. The statement continued that because of insecurity and instability, however, these companies did not come back after the war. The company said the gold factory located in Northwest Tigray’s Asgede district, in the Tabia Lemat area, is free from pollution, waste and environmental distraction. Without naming a specific country, Tigray President Getachew told the region’s diaspora community in a Zoom meeting that he believes more gold than reported is smuggled out of Ethiopia. Getachew said what is happening in Tigray is becoming 'a crime.' 'It is a very serious problem. It is not just robbery. People are losing their animals because of the dangerous chemical used by the miners. There are people who are known to participate in this network from top to bottom among government and security officials.' VOA’s repeated attempts to get comment from the Tigray Bureau of Land and Mining and the Mining Ministry, as well as the National Bank of Ethiopia, were unsuccessful.

Thousands in Serbia turn New Year’s celebration into anti-government protest	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Instead of the traditional boisterous street partying on New Year's Eve, tens of thousands of protesters led by university students gathered overnight in Belgrade and other Serbian cities to demand political reforms and justice in the Balkan country. The protesters have been actively demonstrating following the tragic collapse of a concrete canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad's central train station on Nov. 1, which resulted in 15 deaths. The tragedy has been attributed to corruption and substandard construction practices by the populist Serbian leadership, leading to a widespread public outcry and demands for accountability. Students from various Belgrade universities have organized the protest under the slogan 'There is No New Year — You Still Owe Us for the Old One.' The loud crowd, chanting 'We Want Justice,' went silent at 11:52 p.m. with 15 minutes to honor the victims of the Novi Sad tragedy. Many were holding banners with a red handprint, which has become a symbol of the antigovernment protests, telling the authorities that they have blood on their hands. Earlier, they marched past a state-sponsored concert where the crowd danced to folk music tunes. Police guarded the area where the concert was taking place and set up metal fences while directing the protesting crowd to other streets nearby to avoid contact between the two groups. The antigovernment protesters emphasized that, despite the festive season, their commitment to seeking justice remains unwavering. The student-led movement has garnered support from various societal groups, including professors, farmers and actors, reflecting broader discontent with autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic's leadership. Thousands of people also gathered in Novi Sad and the southern city of Nis for parallel gatherings also led by university students in those cities. In Belgrade, state-sponsored concerts and other New Year’s celebrations were organized in the city center and in a newly built high-rise Belgrade Waterfront neighborhood, which Vucic has claimed is his own project together with the United Arab Emirates investors. Belgrade has become a favorite partying destination for tourists on New Year's Eve, with street partying and huge fireworks. The crowds in Belgrade braved very cold weather and fog to join the students. The New Year's Eve protest comes just more than a week after tens of thousands rallied together with the students in what was one of the biggest gatherings in recent years in the Serbian capital. Serbia's public prosecutor on Monday indicted 13 people, including a former minister, over the collapse of the concrete canopy. The protesters say that is not enough as the indictment does not include charges of possible corrupt deals during a renovation of the Novi Sad train station that was part of a wider deal with Chinese companies. Vucic earlier told pro-government Prva TV that all student demands have been fulfilled. 'I have always been ready to talk, I am asking them now but they won't talk to me, they have no arguments, the prosecutors fulfilled the last of their demands, all documents they wanted have been published and nothing happened,' Vucic said, adding he won't be toppled by street protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-serbia-turn-new-year-s-celebration-into-anti-government-protest/7920689.html	2024-12-31T19:09:25-08:00	
US chief justice warns of 'dangerous' calls to disregard court rulings	U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday warned about a rising number of threats to the judiciary's independence, including calls for violence against judges and suggestions by elected officials to disregard court rulings they disagree with. Roberts in an annual year-end report on the judiciary released just weeks before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office did not directly address what polling suggests has been a decline in public confidence in the judicial system broadly. But Roberts said he felt compelled to highlight several areas of 'illegitimate activity' that went far beyond informed criticism and debate concerning judicial rulings, which he said, 'threaten the independence of judges on which the rule of law depends.' Those areas of threats, he said, include a significant uptick in violent threats and online intimidation directed at judges, disinformation about court cases magnified by social media, and cyberthreats posed by foreign state actors. In the past five years, the U.S. Marshals Service has investigated more than 1,000 serious threats against federal judges, Roberts wrote. In some extreme cases, judicial officers have been issued bulletproof vests, he said. He cited the risks of hackers stealing confidential information and of hostile foreign state actors spreading disinformation online, including by using bots to distort judicial decisions and 'foment discord within our democracy.' Roberts also highlighted what he said were instances in the past few years in which 'elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings.' 'These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected,' Roberts wrote. Roberts, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, did not specify what cases he was referring to, nor did he reference recent Supreme Court rulings that have set off political firestorms. Those include its 2022 decision rolling back abortion rights or its July ruling granting Trump substantial immunity for actions taken in office in the now-dismissed 2020 election subversion criminal case he faced. The abortion ruling prompted protests outside of several justices' homes, and an armed man was charged in 2022 with attempting to assassinate conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh after being arrested near his home. Roberts' report also did not discuss recent ethics controversies concerning gifts and travel received by members of the Supreme Court that have prompted investigations by Democratic lawmakers and calls for reforms. Roberts acknowledged court rulings can 'provoke strong and passionate reactions' and said criticism was not a threat, and that 'public engagement with the work of the courts results in a better-informed polity and a more robust democracy.' But he said public officials 'regrettably have engaged in recent attempts to intimidate judges — for example, suggesting political bias in the judge's adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.' 'Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others,' he wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-chief-justice-warns-of-dangerous-calls-to-disregard-court-rulings/7920680.html	2024-12-31T18:43:30-08:00	
US Capitol riot fugitive seeks asylum in Canada	OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — An American man who fled after being sentenced to prison for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking political asylum in Canada, as he waits and hopes for a pardon when Donald Trump returns to the White House. Antony Vo, 32, was sentenced to nine months behind bars and ordered to report to a federal prison on June 14, 2024, but instead he fled to Canada. More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on Congress, which sought to disrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. Vo, from Indiana, was convicted at a jury trial in Washington of four counts of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct related to his actions. 'I knew Canada has a history of being welcoming to refugees, from Vietnam War draft dodgers to the people who hid Edward Snowden in Hong Kong,' he told AFP. 'So I packed up my snowboarding gear and drove across the border.' In refugee claim documents, Vo said the riot was 'a peaceful protest' that was 'subverted as part of a domestic regime-change operation to politically assassinate Trump and his supporters.' He added that he was 'persecuted, maltreated,' and subjected to an 'unfair trial' over his political beliefs, and if sent back to the United States would be jailed 'under inhumane conditions.' The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House, in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 vote. More than 140 police officers were injured during hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray. Vo insisted that he saw no violence. Images on social media showed Vo and his mother, Annie -- who fled Vietnam in 1991 and was granted asylum in the United States -- smiling inside the Capitol that day. She was arrested in March and is awaiting trial. Vo said he hopes to stay in Canada 'until the situation is safe for me to return' to the United States. 'When Donald Trump takes office, I hope he pardons me and the rest of the January 6 protesters.' Trump has called the rioters patriots and political prisoners and told a CNN town hall that he was 'inclined to pardon many of them.' Several Capitol riot defendants have seized upon Trump's election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris to ask that their trials or sentencing be put on hold. Trump himself, who takes office again in January, was charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the case never made it to trial and is now being wound down under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president. Vo said that he had also tried to seek asylum in Argentina, Mexico, El Salvador, Vietnam, Belarus, and Russia. 'I seriously explored getting paramotoring lessons and then paramotoring from Key West to Cuba to seek asylum there too,' he said in his claim. Vo said that in Canada, 'people have really taken good care of me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-capitol-riot-fugitive-seeks-asylum-in-canada/7920659.html	2024-12-31T17:20:17-08:00

Ivory Coast asks French troops to leave, latest African country to do so	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Ivory Coast announced on Tuesday that French troops will leave the country after a decadeslong military presence. It is the latest African nation to downscale military ties with its former colonial power. Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara said the pullout would begin in January. France has had as many as 600 troops in Ivory Coast. 'We have decided on the concerted and organized withdrawal of French forces in Ivory Coast,' he said, adding that the military infantry battalion of Port Bouet that is run by the French army will be handed over to Ivorian troops. Outtara's announcement follows that of other leaders across West Africa, where France's military is being asked to leave. Analysts have described the moves as part of the wider structural transformation in the region's engagement with Paris. Several West African nations — including coup-hit Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — have recently asked the French to leave. Most recently, Senegal and Chad did the same. Chad is considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa. The downscaling of military ties comes as France has been making efforts to revive its waning political and military influence on the continent by devising a new military strategy that would sharply reduce its permanent troop presence in Africa. France has now been kicked out of more than 70% of African countries where it had a troop presence since ending its colonial rule. The French remain only in Djibouti, with 1,500 soldiers, and Gabon, with 350 troops. After expelling French troops, military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. The security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from armed groups and government forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ivory-coast-asks-french-troops-to-leave-latest-african-country-to-do-so/7920403.html	2024-12-31T15:37:31-08:00	
Romania, Bulgaria join borderless Schengen zone	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Romania and Bulgaria became full members of the Schengen zone on Wednesday, expanding the borderless area to 29 members and ending a 13-year wait for the two eastern European countries. The expansion, made possible when Austria and other members dropped their objections to the former communist countries joining, officially took place at midnight on Wednesday, marked by ceremonies at various border posts. Romania and Bulgaria, both members of the European Union since 2007, were partially included in the Schengen zone in March, eliminating border checks at ports and airports. But Austria had threatened to veto their full entry over migration concerns, which meant that controls still applied at land border crossings. Vienna backed off its veto threat in December after the three countries reached a deal on a 'border protection package,' clearing the way for Romania and Bulgaria, two of the EU's poorest countries, to join Schengen. Overlap with EU but not identical Created in 1985, the zone will now include 25 of the EU's 27 members, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, covering a total population of more than 400 million people. Romania and Bulgaria had met the Schengen zone's technical requirements for membership since 2011. But 'member states objected every time' they tried to join, analyst Valentin Naumescu told Agence France-Presse. That became 'a source of frustration exploited by anti-EU parties, which alleged Romania was being treated unfairly,' he said. The resentment came into play in Romania's recent presidential elections, in which far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surged to a surprise first-round win, before the polls were canceled amid claims of Russian interference. Now, 'that feeling of being second-class citizens' should fade, Naumescu said. Nations came to an agreement Leaders on both sides hailed the expansion as 'historic.' Austria had for years complained about hosting a disproportionate number of undocumented migrants as a result of poorly protected external Schengen borders. It dropped its objections to Romania (population 19 million) and Bulgaria (6.5 million) joining Schengen after the three countries signed a border protection agreement in November. The deal provides for the joint deployment of guards to the Bulgarian-Turkish border and temporary controls at land crossings for an initial period of six months. Joining the zone will boost Romania's and Bulgaria's gross domestic product by at least one percentage point, analysts estimate. Truck drivers celebrate the change Lorry drivers, who currently wait up to 20 hours at border crossings, celebrated the news. 'It was a pure waste of time for drivers, who couldn't even stop to rest because they had to move their vehicles every 10 minutes,' said Beniamin Lucescu, head of a Romanian transport federation. Poor road and railroad infrastructure in Bulgaria could limit the positive impact there. The countries' tourism sectors are meanwhile expecting a surge in visitors from the two countries to nearby Greece. 'It's excellent news,' said 46-year-old sales manager Ivailo Kirkov, who owns a house in northern Greece. 'We'd been waiting impatiently.' Greek teacher and tour guide Gueorgui Grantcharov predicted a rush of Romanian and Bulgarian tourists to Greece. With no queues at the border, 'it takes just over four hours to get from Sofia to Thessaloniki,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romania-bulgaria-join-borderless-schengen-zone/7920398.html	2024-12-31T15:24:20-08:00

Kenyan president acknowledges police abuses at protests	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenyan President William Ruto on Tuesday acknowledged abuses by Kenya's security forces, in the wake of demonstrations against a recent wave of alleged kidnappings that have sparked outrage in the country. Security forces in the East African nation have been accused of carrying out dozens of illegal detentions since youth-led anti-government demonstrations in June and July were harshly repressed. And on Monday, police forcibly detained dozens of protesters and fired tear gas into small peaceful rallies calling for the release of those who had disappeared. 'It cannot be denied that there have been instances of excessive and extrajudicial actions by members of the security services,' Ruto said in his new year's address, without specifying what those actions may have been. 'That said, it is crucial to remember that every freedom has its limits, and that public safety and order must always supersede the desire for unchecked liberty,' he said. Last week, the embattled president had promised to 'stop the abductions,' a vow taken by human rights activists as an admission of guilt. But he also urged parents to take responsibility for their children. The latest disappearances have by and large involved young people who have criticized Ruto online. Two of them had published an image generated using artificial intelligence of the head of state lying in a coffin. 'These are clear signals that our moral fabric is at risk of decay, exacerbated by various factors, including the manipulation of digital technology, particularly social media, to amplify anti-social behavior and erode moral values,' Ruto said in his end-of-year address. A Nairobi court on Monday ruled that the security forces should 'immediately and unconditionally' free five men who were reportedly abducted. Judge Bahati Mwamuye ordered the police to present the five in court on Tuesday or 'explain under oath the circumstances of the matter' or their whereabouts. None of the missing were present in court, where a tearful father asked where his son was. The police inspector general, who was also summoned, sent a representative in his stead. While police have denied involvement in the disappearances, activists have questioned why they do not appear to be investigating them. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch said its research pointed toward a unit drawn from multiple security agencies. Last week, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it counted seven cases of abductions reported this month. Six of those who disappeared are still missing. In all, 29 of the 82 people reported to have disappeared since June remain unaccounted for, according to the human rights commission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-acknowledges-police-abuses-at-protests/7920354.html	2024-12-31T14:15:25-08:00

US oil production rose to record high in October, data show	NEW YORK — U.S. oil production rose 260,000 barrels per day month-over-month to a record 13.46 million bpd in October as demand surged to the highest levels since the pandemic, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on Tuesday. U.S. oil output has grown rapidly this year as drilling operations became more efficient, even as concerns of oversupply have weighed heavily on prices for the commodity amid weaker-than-expected demand growth, especially in China, the top oil-importing nation. Year-over-year, U.S. oil production rose 2.3% in October, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures prices CLc1 averaged 16% lower during the month, according to Reuters calculations. Still, the pace of growth of U.S. oil output is moderating, analysts said. Annual oil production growth in the U.S. is tracking around 300,000 to 400,000 bpd in 2024, versus nearly a million bpd in 2023, said Alex Hodes, energy analyst at brokerage StoneX. 'There have been a few infrastructure constraints that have kept production somewhat muted, but I would expect that we will see a lot of the same in 2025,' Hodes said. Strong U.S. oil demand in October was the biggest surprise in the EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly report, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Total U.S. oil demand rose by about 700,000 bpd from September to 21.01 million bpd in October, the highest since August 2019, EIA data showed. Demand for distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil, rose to 4.06 million bpd in October, the highest in a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-oil-production-rose-to-record-high-in-october-data-shows/7920350.html	2024-12-31T14:02:31-08:00	
Wind, rain, threat of floods play spoiler for UK New Year's festivities	LONDON — Revelers in the United Kingdom may have to wring themselves out as they ring in the New Year. A storm system bringing high winds, heavy rain, the possibility of snow and the threat of flooding washed out plans Tuesday for several fireworks displays — in some cases more than 24 hours before the stroke of midnight. Edinburgh's famous Hogmanay street party, garden concert and pyrotechnics show from the city's famous castle were snuffed out before festivities got under way Monday. 'We feel like we are stranded,' said Neeraj Krishnan, who planned a trip from London around the fireworks. 'We don't really know what to do for New Year.' The Met Office forecast gusts up to 96 kilometers per hour (60 mph) across England and Wales on New Year's Day, with gusts up to 120 kmh (75 mph) on hilltops and coastal areas. 'It will be a tricky couple of days and a wet and windy spell for many up into the new year,' said Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell. Heavy rain and strong winds lashed parts of Scotland and the north of England, disrupting some journeys by train and car and playing spoiler to many public celebrations. Fireworks in Blackpool in the northwest of England, and Newcastle's Quayside, and Ripon in North Yorkshire, both in the northeast, and at the Sandown Carnival on the Isle of Wight off the south coast were canceled or postponed because of weather. 'Safety always comes first, and the forecast has made it clear that continuing would pose risks to those attending, as well as our event teams,' the Newcastle City Council said. People were urged to stay away from the coast in Scarborough in northeast England, as a combination of winds and a high tide were expected to pound the shore with large waves. Organizers of London events were keeping a close eye on winds as they prepared to welcome 2025 with a blitz of fireworks along the River Thames and a parade Wednesday afternoon through the center of the city featuring 75 acts and 10,000 performers. The fireworks were planned to be launched against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Darryl Fleming, the fireworks display director for London, told Sky News that the direction of the wind forecast was unlikely to disrupt the display. Among events canceled Wednesday were an annual bathtub boat race in Poole, Dorset, on the south coast and a dip in the sea in Lyme Regis in the southwest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wind-rain-threat-of-floods-play-spoiler-for-uk-new-year-s-festivities/7920344.html	2024-12-31T13:58:32-08:00	
Georgians ring in New Year with mass pro-EU rally	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Tens of thousands of pro-Europe demonstrators rallied outside Georgia's parliament Tuesday night to celebrate the New Year, continuing month-long protests against the government. The Black Sea nation has been in the grip of an unprecedented constitutional crisis since the ruling Georgian Dream Party — widely perceived as increasingly repressive — claimed victory in October's parliamentary polls, which the pro-Western opposition denounced as rigged. The government's Nov. 28 decision to suspend EU accession talks for years triggered daily mass protests that continue to this day. On New Year's Eve, tens of thousands gathered outside parliament in central Tbilisi waving EU and Georgian flags — the latest outpouring of popular unity in the face of what critics say is the government's authoritarian pro-Russian tilt. Many demonstrators brought food to share and set up a festive table spanning dozens of meters on Tbilisi's main avenue decorated with Christmas lights, transforming the 34th consecutive day of protests into a New Year celebration. 'Tonight once again proves that the Georgian people will not allow a pro-Russian government to turn our country into a Russian-style despotism,' said one demonstrator, 42-year-old Ilia Darsavelidze. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's puppets in Tbilisi are powerless against the will of our entire nation. We will reclaim our rightful place in Europe.' Georgia's outgoing President Salome Zurabishvili — at loggerheads with the ruling party — joined the demonstrators. '2024 was the year of our unity, and 2025 will be the year of our victory,' she told the crowd. Zurabishvili's mandate was meant to end on Dec. 29, when her successor and Georgian Dream loyalist Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as Georgia's next figurehead president, following a controversial election process. But Zurabishvili refused to step down, saying she remains the country's 'only legitimate leader' until October's election is rerun. She has earlier declared the new parliament and government 'illegitimate,' while opposition parties have refused to enter the new legislature. In the first 10 days of protests, riot police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators — some of whom threw fireworks and stones. The Interior Ministry reported more than 400 arrests, while the country's top human rights official, ombudsman Levan Ioseliani, and Amnesty International have accused security forces of 'torturing' those detained. The reported police brutality has drawn growing international condemnation, with Washington and several European countries sanctioning Georgian Dream officials. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland said on Tuesday that Georgian authorities should consider fresh elections as a way out of the country's political crisis. The Georgian Dream Party's government faces accusations of an authoritarian, pro-Russian shift that has undermined Georgia's EU bid, a goal enshrined in the constitution and supported by 80% of the population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgians-ring-in-new-year-with-mass-pro-eu-rally/7920347.html	2024-12-31T13:56:10-08:00	
Ecuador AG confirms bodies are missing boys as military personnel held	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Four bodies discovered last week are a group of boys reported missing at the start of the month, Ecuador's attorney general's office said on Tuesday, as a judge ordered detention for 16 military personnel while their alleged role in the disappearance is investigated. The boys, ages 11 to 15, went missing on Dec. 8 from the Las Malvinas neighborhood in the coastal city of Guayaquil. Their families have said they went out to play football. The case has sparked outrage throughout Ecuador, with protesters in the capital Quito and elsewhere demanding answers about what happened to the children. President Daniel Noboa's government has deployed members of the military to patrol streets and assist law enforcement efforts amid a crackdown on crime, which has battered the country over the past several years. Commanders of Ecuador's armed forces said last week the children were detained while allegedly committing a robbery and subsequently taken to a military base before being released. Genetic testing confirmed the identity of the four bodies, found on Dec. 24 in the town of Taura, the attorney general's office said on social media. The confirmation came just after a judge in Guayaquil ordered 16 members of the air force to be detained while prosecutors investigate their alleged participation. The lawyer for the military personnel said he will appeal the ruling. 'Let them go directly to jail where they belong. We want them to be detained [in jail], not in a military base,' said Antonio Arroyo, an uncle of two of the missing boys, after the hearing. Protesters gathered outside the court in support of the children's families. Neither the defense ministry nor Noboa's office have commented on the identifications or the judge's ruling. Both have previously expressed support for the families and the investigation, with Noboa proposing the boys be declared national heroes. The investigation will last 90 days, the attorney general's office said. The personnel under investigation were placed in military custody last week and could face disciplinary action for the way they detained the minors. The youths were apprehended in an 'unforeseen' manner by a patrol that had carried out an operation to support customs officials nearby, air force commander general Celiano Cevallos said on Monday. No official report of the arrests or the alleged robbery was made and the location where the boys were allegedly released is unknown, according to lawyers representing the children's families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-ag-confirms-bodies-are-missing-boys-as-military-personnel-held-/7920336.html	2024-12-31T13:31:40-08:00	
Macron acknowledges error on early elections in New Year's speech	PARIS — In a rare moment of contrition, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he recognized that his decision to call early parliamentary elections in June had created more political instability in the country. The speech caps a tumultuous 2024 for Macron, who shocked the nation halfway through the year by calling early elections, a gamble that backfired when voters delivered a hung parliament with a big increase in far-right lawmakers, diluting Macron's power. 'Lucidity and humility force [me] to recognize that at this stage, this decision has produced more instability than peace, and I fully own up to that,' Macron said in a televised address ahead of New Year's celebrations. 'The dissolution caused more divisions in the Assembly than solutions for the French people,' he said in the clearest mea culpa since the elections. Macron had justified his decision to call early elections in the wake of a bad score at European elections by the need to 'clarify' the political situation. But he lost his workable majority and took two months to name a minority government, which eventually collapsed in December, the first time that happened in France since 1962. As a result, France failed to approve a budget for 2025 before the end-of-year deadline, and Macron had to name his fourth prime minister this year, centrist veteran Francois Bayrou, in December. Choices to make Macron also opened the door to use referendums this year without using the word, saying he would ask the French to decide on 'decisive' issues, without elaborating which ones. 'I want us to act with 2050 in our sights. We will have choices to make for our economy, our democracy, our security, our children,' he said. The French constitution grants powers to the president to initiate referendums. Macron has also used 'citizen conventions' — gatherings of randomly picked citizens without any binding power — in the past to quell revolts such as the yellow vest rebellion on certain issues. On international issues, in which he retains wide diplomatic and military powers, Macron said the European Union should stop being 'naive' when it comes to international trade, as the bloc faces threats of tariffs by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'We must say no to trade rules enacted by others and that we are the only ones to still comply with. Say no to everything that makes us more dependent on others without trade-offs and without preparing [for] the future,' he said. He also mentioned the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and election manipulation in Georgia, Romania and Moldova, as proof that Europe should not take its security for granted. 'That's why Europe should stop delegating its security and defense to other powers,' he said, urging EU partners, who often rely on the U.S. security umbrella, to do more for their own defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-acknowledges-error-on-early-elections-in-new-year-s-speech/7920332.html	2024-12-31T13:24:03-08:00	
Pentagon chief loses bid to reject 9/11 plea deals	WASHINGTON — A military appeals court has ruled against Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's effort to throw out the plea deals reached for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other defendants in the 9/11 attacks, a U.S. official said. The decision puts back on track the agreements that would have the three men plead guilty to one of the deadliest attacks on the United States in exchange for being spared the possibility of the death penalty. The attacks by al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, and helped spur U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in what the George W. Bush administration called its war on terror. The military appeals court released its ruling Monday night, according to the U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Military prosecutors and defense attorneys for Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the attacks, and two co-defendants reached the plea agreements after two years of government-approved negotiations. The deals were announced late last summer. Supporters of the plea agreements see them as a way of resolving the legally troubled case against the men at the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Pretrial hearings for Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi have been underway for more than a decade. Much of the focus of pretrial arguments has been on how torture of the men while in CIA custody in the first years after their detention may taint the overall evidence in the case. Within days of news of the plea deal this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. He cited the gravity of the 9/11 attacks in saying that as defense secretary, he should decide on any plea agreements that would spare the defendants the possibility of execution. Defense lawyers said Austin had no legal authority to reject a decision already approved by the Guantanamo court's top authority and said the move amounted to unlawful interference in the case. The military judge hearing the 9/11 case, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, had agreed that Austin lacked standing to throw out the plea bargains after they were underway. That had set up the Defense Department's appeal to the military appeals court. Austin now has the option of taking his effort to throw out the plea deals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, the Pentagon said it had repatriated one of the longest-held detainees at the Guantanamo military prison, a Tunisian man who U.S. authorities approved for transfer more than a decade ago. Ridah bin Saleh al-Yazidi's return to Tunisia leaves 26 men at Guantanamo. That's down from a peak population of about 700 Muslim men detained abroad and brought to the prison in the years after the September 11 attacks. Al-Yazidi's repatriation leaves 14 men awaiting transfer to other countries after U.S. authorities waived any prosecution and cleared them as security risks. The Biden administration, pressed by rights groups to free remaining Guantanamo detainees held without charge, transferred out three other men this month. The U.S. says it is searching for suitable and stable countries willing to receive the remaining 14. In a statement, the U.S. military said it had worked with authorities in Tunisia for the 'responsible transfer' of al-Yazidi. He had been a prisoner at Guantanamo since 2002, when the U.S. began sending Muslim detainees taken abroad there. Al-Yazidi is the last of a dozen Tunisian men once held at Guantanamo. Of those remaining at Guantanamo, seven — including Mohammed and his 9/11 co-defendants — face active cases. Two others of the 26 total have been convicted and sentenced by the military commission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-loses-bid-to-reject-9-11-plea-deals-/7920328.html	2024-12-31T13:10:06-08:00	
Somali security forces fend off Islamic State attack in Puntland	Authorities in the Somali autonomous region of Puntland said eight foreign militants were killed following an attack by Islamic fighters on security forces early Tuesday. Residents said the attack started with a suicide bombing that targeted an area in Dharjale village in the far eastern highlands of Puntland, where security forces and officials were camped. In an audio statement posted on the Telegram channel of the region’s security forces, spokesperson for Puntland security operations Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed confirmed the attack. 'Puntland anti-terrorism forces in the Dharjale, Bari region were attacked by the bloodsucking Daesh terrorist group,' he said. 'The security forces have been following their movements, and they were ready. The bodies of eight foreigners and their weapons have been displayed.' Ahmed said Puntland security forces sustained 'limited casualties.' Residents reported additional casualties among civilians in the village from the shrapnel of the explosion. Photos purported to be of dead militants show severed heads, and burned and mutilated flesh, indicating the use of a massive explosive device. Puntland this month announced that preparations for an offensive against extremist groups in the region have been completed. The region’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, urged the public to support the operation, without disclosing when it may start. Witnesses and residents said that Puntland forces moved to the east of Puntland after the preparations concluded. Al-Shabab and Islamic State, or IS, have been operating in Puntland. The operation appears to be focusing on IS. Deni offered amnesty to militants who renounce violence and their membership in the terror groups. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS in Somalia increased its membership numbers this year. IS numbers previously were reported to be between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts estimate their current numbers to be 500 to 600 militants, a figure yet to be confirmed by local authorities. A majority of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa. IS in Somalia was formed in October 2015 by a group of former al-Shabab fighters led by the cleric Sheikh Abdulkadir Mumin, who reportedly pledged allegiance to the late IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mumin appears to have survived a U.S. airstrike on May 31.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-security-forces-fend-off-islamic-state-attack-in-puntland/7920275.html	2024-12-31T12:13:44-08:00

Post-G20 Rio: Promises to address root causes of migration, global displacement	Washington — As G20 leaders convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November, they set an ambitious goal to lift 600 million people out of poverty by 2030, highlighting the urgent need to address poverty and global health care — the root causes of migration and forced displacement. During the summit, experts said the world's 20 largest economies have the capacity to lessen the impact of the root causes through social policies and regional migration agreements. Experts like Paulo Illes, founder of the Center for Immigrant Human Rights and Citizenship, emphasized the importance of recognizing migration issues as legitimate. 'That must always be addressed from a human rights perspective,' Illes told VOA. 'Additionally, G20 leaders should acknowledge that migration also occurs due to structural issues such as poverty, environmental disasters, wars and conflicts.' Euclimar Fuentes, a Venezuelan migrant living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an example of how these issues converged. Born in Venezuela, Fuentes remembers a happy childhood there. 'We would go to the beach for breakfast as a family. Culturally, life was beautiful in Venezuela,' she told VOA. Her father’s retirement after years as a police officer gave the family a comfortable life. The situation in Venezuela deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic because of a combination of preexisting economic, political and social crises compounded by the global health emergency. 'It’s difficult when a family, a whole community, is left without food, electricity, energy or water. It’s hard to live in a country where you have nothing to eat,' Fuentes said. Her family’s challenges intensified when her son was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2020. 'We tried to treat him there, but it was hard,' she told VOA, adding that many children died in the same circumstances: no resources, no treatment, nothing to eat. 'We didn’t want him to be part of that system [and die],' she said. On December 26, 2020, Fuentes and her family left Venezuela. They considered different countries, including the United States, but because of her son’s illness and the path for humanitarian status, they chose Brazil, which according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is home to about 61,000 Venezuelans. G20 declaration The G20’s official declaration highlighted the need to address the root causes of displacement, including hunger and poverty. The U.N. estimates that 2.4 billion people worldwide live in poverty, a crisis that has increased migration, Brazilian Development Minister Wellington Dias said. 'But beyond the migration issue,' Dias told VOA, 'Hunger and poverty are not just problems for those who are hungry or living in poverty. It’s a problem for the middle class, for the wealthy, for rich countries and for wealthy individuals.' The declaration included creating the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to implement policies such as cash transfers to 500 million people, school meals for 150 million children, and health services for 200 million women and young children. Funding is expected to come from at least 40 nations, 13 global organizations and various nonprofits and foundations, managed through several financial institutions. 'It’s no longer just giving food baskets,' Dias said. 'We are talking about implementing a development plan that must address education, which is a key foundation for eradicating poverty, as well as health, the economy, job creation and infrastructure.' The U.N. noted that food insecurity, migration and displacement are intricately linked to climate change, natural disasters, conflicts and poverty — all major conversations at the G20 summit. The challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these connections, with health crises, economic hardship and displacement driving increased migration in the Western Hemisphere, Dias said. Steve Seide, a 22-year-old political science student from Haiti, also embodied the struggles faced by many migrants. He left his homeland in 2023 because of a lack of jobs and increasing security concerns. 'I chose Brazil because I heard of work opportunities and how welcoming Brazilian people are,' he told VOA. Seide’s journey to Brazil was dangerous and expensive. To reach his destination, he crossed without documentation into the Dominican Republic. 'The first time, I did not get in. But I went back to the border,' he said. After spending a month in the Dominican Republic, he eventually secured a humanitarian visa and is on a path to a stable life in Brazil. 'In life, you can’t stop. If you need to get somewhere, you have to fight until the end,' he said. Future response efforts The global response to the pandemic also took center stage at the G20 summit, where the United States spearheaded efforts to secure new contributions toward a $2 billion pandemic fund, pledging up to $667 million by 2026. The goal is to help developing countries prepare for and respond to future pandemics. However, U.S. participation in this initiative is subject to congressional approval. Member countries also agreed to establish 'a governance mechanism that integrates the key players in the global health security and financing ecosystem, with the World Health Organization at the center.' As G20 leaders sought to address the interconnected challenges of migration, poverty and global health, stories like those of Fuentes and Seide underscored the importance of international cooperation and sustainable solutions. 'When you have your home, your piece of land, your family, you don’t think about leaving,' Fuentes said, adding that being separated from her loved ones is still 'very hard.' 'It’s been three years, but it’s still hard. Leaving everything behind, not knowing when you’ll see your loved ones again — it’s a pain that doesn’t go away. … Leaving was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. But sometimes, it’s the only choice you have to protect who you love,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/post-g20-rio-promises-to-address-root-causes-of-migration-global-displacement/7920243.html	2024-12-31T12:06:16-08:00	
Zimbabwe president signs death penalty abolition into law	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa — who has not signed death warrants for those facing capital sentences since he came to power in 2017 — signed the death penalty abolition bill into law Dec. 31, 2024, presidential spokesman George Charamba confirmed to VOA. 'Yes, the president had a personal role he played in moving matters in that direction, and this [is] arising from his own historical experience [as] a prisoner who had been condemned but only survived on the basis of age. But we want to situate this decision as a decision of parliament,' Charamba said. Mnangagwa survived a death sentence during the colonial era in the 1970s, as he was considered underage to face the gallows. Edwin Mushoriwa, an opposition member of parliament, introduced the death abolition bill. And parliament — which is dominated by the ruling ZANU-PF — accepted the idea. 'We are happy [with the] milestone we have actually reached,' Mushoriwa told VOA on Tuesday. 'The reason I had to bring that bill actually [has] to do with the fact that out of the 62 inmates today on the death row, the majority of them come from poor backgrounds. Secondly, [the] death penalty by nature is not part of our culture as Africans, as Zimbabweans. It’s a penalty that was brought during the colonial era. So, we just believe that [the] death penalty is not proper.' Several human rights groups have been calling for Zimbabwe to abolish the death penalty. Parvais Jabbar, executive director of the London-based NGO called the Death Penalty Project, said Zimbabwe has joined two-thirds of the world that no longer uses capital punishment as a lawful sanction. 'In fact, in the African Union alone, there have been a number of countries that have abolished a death penalty in recent years. So, there is clearly an African movement taking place in relation to this issue,' Jabbar said. 'I'm also encouraged by the government’s statements about respect for human rights in abolishing the death penalty, and I hope it will be taken and seen as an opportunity for further reforms in the area of human rights,' Jabbar added. 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning of wider reforms. I also hope this will provide a stimulus for other countries in the region to also consider abolition — countries like Kenya, and others.' But not everyone is happy with the bill. Vincent Mazilankatha, an artisan miner, said deaths have risen in his area of trade since the bill was first discussed. 'If you just look at how people are killing each other, especially in the mining areas, that's when you see that [the] death penalty was supposed to remain in place. Because before, people were so afraid that if you kill, you're going to be hanged. So, I think it's not good at all,' Mazilankatha said. 'This act was supposed to be there and to remain in place as just [a] deterrent, because before talking about the abolition of [the] death penalty, people were not killing each other like what they are doing now,' he added. 'Imagine a person who has killed someone gets 20 years' imprisonment. And that person is 21 years [old]. When he comes out, [he’s] 41 years [old]. Then life goes on. It's not fair at all.' Amnesty International said Zimbabwe joins 24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only. Zimbabwe’s last-known execution was in 2005, though courts continued to impose death sentences for cases of murder committed under aggravating circumstances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-president-signs-death-penalty-abolition-into-law/7920263.html	2024-12-31T12:01:54-08:00	
US strikes Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen amid rising regional tensions	The U.S. military said its forces carried out multiple precision strikes in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen amid escalating tensions in the region. A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Central Command said the strikes hit Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, along with other Houthi-controlled coastal locations. The strikes were carried out by U.S. Navy ships on Monday and Tuesday and targeted a Houthi command and control facility along with sites that produced and stored weapons, including missiles and drones. The facilities targeted in the strikes were used in previous Houthi operations, 'such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' according to the U.S. statement. The U.S. Central Command said the strikes are 'a part of CENTCOM's effort to degrade Iran-backed Houthi efforts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region.' A Houthi spokesperson called the strikes 'a blatant violation of the sovereignty of an independent state and a blatant support for Israel.' The Houthis have conducted multiple missile attacks directed at Israel and have carried out more than a year of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis say their campaign is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The United States has designated Hamas and the Houthis as terror groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-strikes-houthi-controlled-sites-in-yemen-amid-rising-regional-tensions/7920087.html	2024-12-31T10:01:16-08:00	
Israeli attacks push Gaza health care system near collapse, UN rights office says	GENEVA — Repeated Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals and nearby operations have brought Gaza’s health care system to its knees, according to a report issued Monday by the U.N. human rights office. The 19-page report finds, 'Israel’s pattern of deadly attacks' on and near hospitals 'has led to the destruction of most hospitals in Gaza,' leading to sustained combat in and around many hospitals and 'pushing the health care system to the brink of total collapse.' 'The situation has deteriorated to a catastrophic level since October 2023, as this already damaged health system has been targeted, resulting in the killing of hundreds of health and medical professionals,' authors of the report assert. The report covers the period from Oct. 7, 2023 — when Hamas militants launched a terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages — to June 30, 2024. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. During this period, the report documents at least 136 strikes on at least 27 hospitals and 12 other medical facilities, claiming many casualties among medical staff and civilians and causing significant damage, 'if not complete destruction of civilian infrastructure.' 'This report graphically details the destruction of the health care system in Gaza, and the extent of killing of patients, staff, and other civilians in these attacks in blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law,' Volker Türk, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement coinciding with the publication of the report. He said the report raises serious concerns about Israel’s compliance with international law. It points out that medical personnel and hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law, 'provided they do not commit, or are not used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy.' 'As if the relentless bombing and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza were not enough, the one sanctuary where Palestinians should have felt safe in fact became a death trap,' Türk said. 'The protection of hospitals during warfare is paramount and must be respected by all sides, at all times.' Israeli response Israel has vigorously refuted these charges. In an 11-page response, Israel’s Permanent Mission in Geneva described this fourth 'thematic report' by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as one of many examples 'of the inherent obsession of OHCHR with vilifying Israel.' It accused the agency of dismissing 'well-documented evidence of Hamas military activities in health facilities' and of its 'unwillingness to recognize Hamas’s systemic exploitation of Gazan medical facilities for terror purposes.' The Permanent Mission called the methodology employed in OHCHR reports as 'fundamentally flawed.' It criticized the agency’s reliance on 'unreliable sources' and justified its attacks on hospitals on the grounds that these health care centers were being used by Palestinian armed groups. 'There is ample evidence regarding Hamas terror activity in medical facilities,' the Permanent Mission stated. 'Hamas embeds its tunnel system and infrastructure within the premises of medical facilities as a matter of strategy and utilizes them as arms caches and accessible headquarters for its operatives.' The OHCHR reports attacks on hospitals have occurred in each of the areas in which the Israeli military has conducted ground operations starting in November 2023 with an attack on Al-Shifa Medical Complex and other hospitals in Gaza City. The attacks continue to this day. The report notes that 'The appalling destruction wrought by the Israeli military’s attacks on the Kamal Adwan hospital last Friday — leaving the population of North Gaza with almost no access to adequate health care — reflects the pattern of attacks documented in the report.' Reacting to the attack on the Kamal Adwan hospital, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, expressed alarm Sunday at the ongoing attacks across the Gaza Strip and the airstrike on Kamal Adwan hospital, warning that 'the very means of people’s survival are being dismantled.' According to the World Health Organization, 15 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain 'partially functional,' nine in the south and six in the north. 'The health system is under severe threat,' said Tedros Adhanan Gebgreyesus, WHO director-general, noting that 'hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds.' The OHCHR report finds the increasingly limited healthcare system is preventing many of those with trauma injuries from receiving timely and possibly life-saving treatment. It says attacks on hospitals in Gaza also are having serious implications for patients with 'initially non-fatal conditions, potentially rendering them fatal.' 'Women, especially pregnant women, are suffering gravely. Many women are giving birth with no or minimal pre- and postnatal care, increasing the risk of preventable maternal and child mortality,' it said. It added that people with chronic diseases, such as kidney failure, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, also have lost access to their treatment, 'placing them at risk of worsening health outcomes and death.' Authors of the report say, 'Intentionally directing attacks against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are treated, provided they are not military objectives … and intentionally launching disproportionate attacks, are also war crimes.' It added that 'Under certain circumstances, the deliberate destruction of health care facilities may amount to a form of collective punishment, which would also constitute a war crime.' Human rights chief Türk is calling for independent, thorough and transparent investigations of all of these incidents, 'and full accountability for all violations of international humanitarian and human rights law which have taken place.' In response to this appeal, Israel’s Permanent Mission in Geneva stated, 'The State of Israel reaffirms its commitment to international law, and remains committed to examining and investigating any exceptional incidents through its established mechanisms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-attacks-push-gaza-health-care-system-near-collapse-un-rights-office-says/7920026.html	2024-12-31T09:13:20-08:00	
Thousands march in Bangladesh calling for ousted prime minister's prosecution	DHAKA, BANGLADESH — Thousands of people led by students rallied in Bangladesh's capital on Tuesday, calling for the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and those responsible for hundreds of deaths in a mass uprising against her government in July. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organized the 'March for Unity' at the Central Shaheed Minar, a national monument in Dhaka. Protesters chanted slogans calling for Hasina's trial and the banning of her Awami League party. Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5 after weeks of violence in which authorities say hundreds of people were killed and thousands more injured on orders of her government. The uprising ended the 15-year-rule of the country's longest-serving prime minister, who began a fourth consecutive term in January following an election boycotted by the major opposition parties. Last week, Bangladesh sent a formal request to India to extradite Hasina. She faces many court cases over the deaths of protesters, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. 'Since August 5, we have no more enemies in Bangladesh. Our only enemy is the Awami League,' Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the student movement, said while addressing the crowd. Protesters also urged the interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to issue a formal proclamation by Jan. 15 detailing the events of the uprising. The student leaders want the proclamation to include two key demands: a new constitution after the 1972 charter, which was enacted under Hasina's father, has been abolished, and a ban on the Awami League party. Hasina's Awami League had ruled Bangladesh for 15 years, since 2009. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has already issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organization Interpol in seeking her arrest. Speaking from the U.S., Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, has questioned the credibility of the tribunal and called charges against her a 'political witch hunt.' Meanwhile, the interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the deaths of protesters and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also has called for an investigation, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-bangladesh-calling-for-ousted-prime-minister-s-prosecution/7919904.html	2024-12-31T08:06:36-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on entities in Iran, Russia over election interference	Washington — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election this year. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said the entities — a subsidiary of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and an organization affiliated with Russia's military intelligence agency — aimed to 'stoke socio-political tensions and influence the U.S. electorate during the 2024 U.S. election.' The Cognitive Design Production Center planned influence operations since at least 2023, the Treasury said, while the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) circulated disinformation about candidates in the election and directed and subsidized the creation of deepfakes. The Treasury said CGE also manipulated a video to produce 'baseless accusations concerning a 2024 vice presidential candidate.' It did not specify which candidate was targeted. Republican Donald Trump was elected president in November, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House. 'The Governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith said in the statement. 'The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-entities-in-iran-russia-over-election-interference/7919900.html	2024-12-31T08:05:34-08:00	
Chadian opposition says elections should be canceled, calls for new transition	Yaoundé — An uneasy calm hangs over Chad, where the opposition is calling for an immediate end to the country’s transitional government and the cancellation of the Dec. 29 general elections, which the opposition says were highly boycotted. Chad's elections management body has pledged to count the votes and declare the results, saying irregularities cannot influence the outcome. Assane Bairra, vice president of Chad's National Agency for the Management of Elections (ANGE), said vote counting is under way after the central African state’s local, provincial and parliamentary elections on Sunday. The elections were scheduled to end Chad's three-year transition period following the death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno in April 2021. The late president’s son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, was declared the winner of the presidential election in May. Provisional results for the latest polls are expected by Jan. 15, ANGE said. Assane said ANGE has successfully executed its mission of ending the transitional period by organizing free, fair and transparent elections. The elections body said about 36% of Chad's estimated 8.3 million registered voters took part in Sunday's poll. But opposition parties maintain that turnout was much lower, saying civilians respected opposition calls for a massive boycott. Avocksouma Djona is spokesperson for Chad's Political Actors Consultation Group, or GCAP, a coalition of several dozen political parties. At a press conference on Monday in the capital, N'djamena, said more than 90% of about 8.3 million registered voters adhered to GCAP’s boycott calls. They did so, he said, because civilians learned from Chad's May 6 presidential elections that Deby wants to extend his late father’s long rule. Avocksouma said Chadians are angry because Deby is a dictator who silences all critical voices. In a statement Monday, Succes Masra, president of The Transformers, one of Chad's leading opposition political parties, called for a new transition. It should be marked by truth, dialogue and reconciliation to lay the foundations of a stable and inclusive political system, he said. Masra, who served as prime minister under transitional President Deby, said ongoing tensions in the central African state may degenerate into violence and social strife. Avocksouma said he is certain that despite the massive boycott, ANGE will still proclaim Deby's ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement as the winners of the Dec. 29 elections. Ahead of the vote, opposition parties accused Deby of rigging the elections, a charge Deby denies. Yamingue Betinbaye is a political analyst at the University of N'djamena. He spoke to VOA on Monday via a messaging group. The analyst told VOA that although the opposition has legitimate claims that the boycott was massive and there were irregularities including the stuffing of ballot boxes to rig elections for Deby, it is unlikely that the polls will be annulled as the opposition requests. The Chadian government said calls for the elections to be annulled and for a new transition are intended to cause chaos and sink Chad into violence. The government said civilians should not obey opposition calls to destabilize their country by going out onto the streets to protest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-opposition-says-elections-should-be-canceled-calls-for-new-transition-/7919829.html	2024-12-31T07:03:47-08:00	
Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year's, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. It estimated that power would be restored in 24 to 48 hours, conditions permitting. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. A spokesperson for Genera PR, which oversees power generation, could not be immediately reached for comment. With no idea when power would return, Puerto Ricans began to think ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a resigned shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker who was raking leaves on a nearby sidewalk, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said as he shook his head. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island continues to struggle with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a powerful category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline prior to the storm given years of lack of maintenance and investment. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-all-of-puerto-rico-is-without-power-on-new-year-s-eve/7919758.html	2024-12-31T06:58:23-08:00

US, Boeing investigators examine site of deadly South Korean plane crash	Seoul, South Korea — A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines. All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea's southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame. The plane was seen having engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash. The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday. The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators — one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing — made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren't immediately available. Kim E-bae, Jeju Air's president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations. John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane's hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed 'and might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.' The Boeing 737-800 — an earlier version of 737 than the Max is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety. He said the failure of the plane's system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. 'These are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,' Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. 'Having such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,' he said. South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport's localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea's aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4. The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives. On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. 'The last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,' Park said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-boeing-investigators-examine-site-of-deadly-south-korean-plane-crash/7919714.html	2024-12-31T06:03:58-08:00	
Thailand's economy, tourism remain focus for 2025 under younger Shinawatra	BANGKOK — Thailand has seen another year of political controversy, but the economy continues to be the country's focus for 2025. The installation of Paetongtarn Shinawatra as Thailand's 31st prime minister in August means the country is once again led by a member of the Shinawatra family. But questions remain as to what influence her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, will have, and what kind of policies the ruling Pheu Thai Party will implement. The return of the Shinawatra family at the head of government comes after Srettha Thavisin was removed as prime minister role over an ethics violation. This paved the way for the Pheu Thai party to pick Paetongtarn, whom parliament then elected, making her the youngest Thai prime minister in history. 'I can handle the pressure,' she said at the time. But almost immediately, experts questioned how independent she would be. Paetongtarn is the daughter of Thaksin, a highly divisive but influential figure in Thai politics. He founded the Pheu Thai Party and has been prime minister twice. But after charges of corruption, he fled Thailand in 2008 and spent 15 years in self-exile. He returned in 2023. 'How can we be sure that Paetongtarn, as prime minister, answers to the Thai public and not her father?' Napon Jatusripitak, visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA in August. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist and professor of international relations at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, believes the elder Thaksin's role is clear. 'After 15 years in exile, he is now like an overseeing chairman running the country with his daughter Paetongtarn as chief executive and prime minister,' he told VOA. '2024 was another wasteful year following a much-anticipated election that installed Srettha as prime minister, who got the boot for uncompelling reasons,' Thitinan said. Pheu Thai came to power after Thailand's election winner, the Move Forward Party, was blocked from leading government in 2023. The Move Forward Party was dissolved in August after the Constitutional Court ruled the party's campaign pledges leading up to the election were aimed at toppling the monarchy. It is against the law to criticize the monarchy, which is Thailand's top institution. With Move Forward gone, the new year also will be a challenge for the People's Party, which formed in 2024 as Move Forward's successor. The People's Party has made similar promises as its predecessors, such as the amendment to Thailand's royal defamation law. Political observers will be watching the progression of this newly formed opposition party leading up to Thailand's next elections in 2027. But following nine years of rule by a military government, and the recent political turmoil, the policies of the ruling Pheu Thai Party must now be Thailand's focus, Thitinan said. 'Despite shortcomings behind a heavily doctored government formation, 2025 could see a semblance of stability amid anti-government noises that allow the Thai economy and Thailand's international standing to perk up to a point after years of mismanagement under a military-based regime.' Thailand's economy, the second largest in Southeast Asia, will again be scrutinized. Its annual growth is slower than many of its regional neighbors. Initial forecasts put Thailand with a GDP growth of 3.0% for 2024, but its new revised growth is 2.7%, according to the finance ministry. Some of Thailand's main economic industries, like manufacturing, are struggling with thousands of factories closed in recent years. Kiatanantha Lounkaew, an economics lecturer at the Thammasat University in Bangkok, outlined the economic woes. 'Our economy has been operating with the same structure since the year 2000, and that is why our competitiveness has been eroding. We can't compete in the municipal [foreign direct investments] compared to our regional partners,' he told VOA earlier in 2024. The economic issues have even led to Thaksin weighing in on the subject. The former prime minister laid out a 14-point strategy to fix the country's economy, ranging from reforming the public debt and the agriculture sector, to empowering tourism, launching entertainment complexes and using locally made products. Thitinan said Thailand must look toward digitalization. 'The dial has moved on; they have to be talking about much more digitalization, digital economy, AI, machine learning, education reform,' he told VOA in August. One of the key economic policies has been the launch of the controversial Digital Wallet program, which provides a one-time handout of about $280 in digital money to approximate 50 million citizens to spend locally to stimulate the economy. Although experts have doubted the positive impact the program may have, it's a policy that Paetongtarn has continued from Srettha. 'In terms of policies, the Paetongtarn government feels like a faster-paced version of Srettha's. Both are laser-focused on the economy, but Paetongtarn clearly has the advantage of a bigger team and more resources, thanks to her role as Pheu Thai Party leader and Thaksin's daughter,' Tita Sanglee, associate fellow at the ISEAS Institute, told VOA. 'This seems to have allowed her government to push Pheu Thai's initiatives more actively, things like cash handouts, a three-year debt suspension for farmers, discussions on casino legalization, and efforts to boost tourism and attract foreign investments,' she said. But analysts say Thailand's changing social policies means the country will have a landmark year after parliament already passed the marriage equality legislation, which is set to become law on January 24. 'Even social policies like the marriage equality legislation and the proposal to grant permanent residency, nationality to stateless individuals has clear economic implications. The former reinforces Thailand's position as a leader in the LGBTQ inclusivity, making it more appealing as a destination,' Tita added. Foreign tourism has long been a key pillar of the economy, and the new year is expected to see landmark results. At its peak in 2019, tourism accounted for 11.5% of the country's overall GDP. Thailand welcomed 34 million visitors for 2024, but for 2025 a record-breaking 40 million arrivals is forecast. Relaxing visa entry rules and launching new visa initiatives are aimed at making it easier for international arrivals to visit the country. Whatever the outcome, Thailand's new year directions will be influenced by Thaksin, experts say. Now 75 years old, once an enemy of Thailand's royal and conservative establishments, Thaksin has made his way back into Thailand's politics, albeit unofficially. '2025 could see a reset in motion as Thaksin is allowed to run Thailand from the back with Paetongtarn as figurehead with the royalist establishment's uneasy approval, due to fears of reform-minded People's Party has succeeded the dissolved Move Forward,' Thitinan said. 'Thaksin's involvement in Thailand's foreign relations is something I'd pay close attention to,' said Tita. 'He's got personal ties to many regional leaders, and that could fuel concerns about conflicts of interest. With all the geopolitical turbulence and growing criticism of Thailand's foreign policy, any interference from Thaksin matters.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-economy-and-tourism-remain-focus-for-2025-under-younger-shinawatra-/7919623.html	2024-12-31T05:10:46-08:00	
France strikes Islamic State targets in Syria	France said Tuesday it had carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militant positions in Syria. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said in a post on X that the strikes happened Sunday, but did not specify where in Syria they took place. The French action follows several rounds of U.S. strikes against Islamic State targets in the weeks since rebels ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. Islamic State militants took control of large areas of eastern Syria and western Iraq in 2014, drawing an international response that included a U.S.-led coalition aimed at defeating the group. The militants have lost much of the territory they once held, but they are still present in Syria. The Western military strikes come amid questions about Syria’s political and security future following the fall of Assad’s government. The rebels who led the quick advance that ended with Assad leaving the country have announced they would dissolve all rebel groups and incorporate them under the Syrian military. Syria’s new authorities announced Tuesday the selection of Murhaf Abu Qasra as the new defense minister. Qasra was a leading figure in the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led the rebel push to topple Assad. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-strikes-islamic-state-targets-in-syria-/7919586.html	2024-12-31T04:29:52-08:00	
Moldovans brace for 'no heating, no light' when Russia halts gas supplies	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — On a frigid morning in Moldova's capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with 'no heating, no light.' His concerns aren't unfounded. On January 1, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova's pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country. 'I feel that we've entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve … which worries me greatly,' Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. 'Price increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that's something entirely different.' The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country's largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper. 'There will be no heating, no light,' Murzin added. 'We are entering a very difficult year.' Transnistria declares state of emergency Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier in December, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria's 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. On December 13, Moldova's parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt. Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, said that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a 'potential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova's already-strained resources' to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol. 'It could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue' ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said. Chisinau takes steps The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning January 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours. 'We'll probably have to save power until we have a solution,' said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. 'I hope we'll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.' After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy 'as a political weapon' and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been 'invalidated by an international audit.' 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' he said. For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people. 'We're afraid, but we're happy that there's no snow and the temperatures aren't that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,' she said. 'But I work from home and I'll be directly affected.' She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, 'But regarding power and gas, it's the first time we face this,' she said. 'Energy blackmail' Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom's decision and said that the country has gas supplies 'for the heating season' and measures will be taken 'to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,' adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria. 'The Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,' she said. 'It is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.' Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast 'hybrid war' against the country by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests, and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations. The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn't recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation, to potentially recover 'strategic assets that were forcefully taken over.' Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz, Moldova's main gas operator, in which the Russian company owns a majority stake. In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant. When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets. Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits. 'I think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,' he said. 'Many people will come here, hoping for warmth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovans-brace-for-no-heating-no-light-when-russia-halts-gas-supplies-/7919547.html	2024-12-31T03:10:49-08:00	
Cities across globe prepare to welcome 2025 with local traditions	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — Cities around the world are readying to ring in the New Year with celebrations highlighting local cultures and traditions, after a year roiled by ongoing conflict and political instability. Countries in the South Pacific Ocean will be the first to welcome 2025, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, thousands were expected to throng the downtown or climb the city's ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point — and a light display recognizing Auckland's Indigenous tribes. It follows a year marked by protests over Maori rights in the nation of 5 million. Two hours later in Australia, more than 1 million people are expected at Sydney Harbor for the traditional fireworks. British pop star Robbie Williams will lead a singalong and Indigenous ceremonies and performances will acknowledge the land's first people. Asia readies for Year of Snake Much of Japan has shut down ahead of the nation's biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning, including swatting floor mats called 'tatami' with big sticks. The coming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth — alluding to the reptile's shedding skin. Stores in Japan, which observes the zodiac cycle from January 1, have been selling tiny figures of smiling snakes and other snake-themed products. Other places in Asia will start marking the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year. In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or canceled as the country observes a period of national mourning following the Sunday crash of a Jeju Air flight at Muan that killed 179 people. West's rivals exchange goodwill Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year's greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of growing closeness between two leaders who face tensions with the West. Xi told Putin that their countries will 'always move forward hand in hand,' the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday. China has maintained ties and a robust trade with Russia since the latter's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, helping to offset Western sanctions and attempts to isolate Putin. Midnight Mass, with bubbles Rome's traditional New Year's Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis' Holy Year, the once every quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025. On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter's Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to once again appeal for peace amid wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Minnesota will host an 11 p.m. Mass followed by a champagne reception with toasts. January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary, and many churches will hold vigil Masses on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Paris to recaptures Olympic spirit Paris will cap a momentous 2024 with its traditional festive countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the famed Champs-Elysees. The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements, and marked another major milestone in its recovery from deadly Islamist extremist attacks in 2015. London celebration to feature fireworks London is due to ring in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames and a 10,000-performer parade through the city center on Wednesday. The fireworks will explode against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland — including the Hogmanay Street party, garden concert and castle pyrotechnics show — were already canceled. Rio to see 2 million revelers Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil's main New Year's Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with 10 ferries offshore bearing 12 minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists in six cruise ships will witness the show up close. Rio's City Hall was closely guarding its plans for a display of lights and sounds. More than 2 million people are expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze in to concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso. American traditions old and new In New York City, the organization managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop, and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals, as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year's celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The party, covering multiple blocks around the city's main tourism and theater hub, is expected to draw large crowds despite rain and chilly weather. Meanwhile, Las Vegas, Nevada, will bid farewell to 2024 with old — and some new — traditions. Its annual eight-minute pyrotechnic show will be on in the Las Vegas Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of nine casinos. Nearby, the massive Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones. Music, football, a midnight run In Pasadena, California, enthusiastic Rose Parade spectators were to camp out on the cold streets and ring in the New Year hoping for prime spots for the iconic southern California tradition. The parade precedes the Rose Bowl football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Oregon Ducks on January 1. Thousands are expected to participate in a midnight 5K race following the parade route. Some 200,000 people will flock to a party in Nashville, Tennessee, featuring a five-hour show by some of country music's biggest stars. At midnight — an hour after New York's — a 5-meter tall music note weighing 181 kilograms will drop as fireworks light the sky. Celebrations will echo around the globe as 2025 arrives in different time zones, with American Samoa among the last to welcome the new year a full 24 hours after New Zealand.

Russia says debris from Ukrainian drone sparks fire in Smolensk region	Russian officials said Tuesday that debris from a destroyed Ukrainian drone fell on an oil facility in the Smolensk region, causing a fire. The Russian defense ministry said it shot down a total of 68 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 10 over Smolensk. Intercepts also took place over the Bryansk, Crimea, Krasnodar, Tver, Rostov, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said. There were no other reports of damage or casualties from the attacks. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defenses worked to defend against Russian missile attacks Tuesday in Kyiv. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv's City Military Administration, said debris from a falling missile landed on a building but did not cause any damage. In the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine, officials said a missile attack targeted infrastructure sites in the town of Shostka.

Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed, as Tokyo and Seoul close for New Year holidays	TOKYO — Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.9% to 8,159.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% to 20,059.95, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% to 3,383.86 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. China's Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. Trading is set to resume in Tokyo on January 6, as markets will stay closed for the rest of the week for the New Year holidays. South Korean markets will be closed for New Year's Day and resume trading Thursday. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $71.61 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 59 cents to $74.58 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.22 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen.

Southerners in US clean up after tornadoes sweep region	NEW CANEY, TEXAS — Cleanup was under way Monday after a strong storm system spawned hail, rain, high winds and tornadoes across the southern United States over the weekend, killing at least four people. As of Monday afternoon, more than 30 tornadoes had been confirmed as crews worked through about 50 reports of tornado damage spanning from Texas to South Carolina, said Mark Wiley, an emergency response specialist with the National Weather Service's Southern Region Headquarters. The storms came over a busy holiday travel weekend, causing some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. The storms first hit Saturday around the Houston, Texas, area, where the National Weather Service by Monday had confirmed six tornadoes. 'Some of the damage was pretty substantial, some cases leveling homes, some producing quite a bit of roof damage,' said Brian Kyle, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in Houston. About 50 homes in Montgomery County sustained major damage and 30 were destroyed, county official Jason Smith said. A couple hundred more homes sustained minor or cosmetic damage, he said. Cleanup crews labored over the weekend and were continuing to pick up debris Monday. 'I could hear it roar' Carlos Benitez, 41, was already working to rebuild his auto repair shop in the New Caney area. Benitez said he closed his eyes as the storm blew through and when he opened them, 'everything's down.' Sasha Zamora, 39, lives nearby, and was trying to put her baby to sleep when she realized how serious the storm was. 'Immediately, the wind picked up so fast that things were hitting the window,' she said, recounting how she rushed her children to the center of the house. Though her family and her property came through the storm OK, her neighbor's mobile home flipped over, Zamora said. Officials in Mississippi said two people were killed in storms there, including an 18-year-old who died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County. About 22,000 Mississippians remained without power Monday afternoon, according to the website PowerOutage.us. In Texas, a 48-year-old woman died in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the woman was found about 30 meters from her home. Dozens of homes and buildings were significantly damaged in Brazoria County, including an elementary school. In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said, 'It was just a freak accident' and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. Maffucci said that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and 'quite a few wrecks.' In the Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville, the storm damaged the downtown area, said city spokeswoman Holly Hollman. Large HVAC units were hurled from the tops of building and the roof was ripped off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said of the storm. Although somewhat uncommon for the season, weather officials say even December can bring severe weather under the right circumstances, as warm temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico combine with a cold front. 'You can still have the right ingredients that lead to these severe events even in the dead of winter in the Deep South,' said Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services' Weather Prediction Center. Still, it's rare for a system to start in Texas and make its way all the way to the Atlantic Coast this time of year, Wiley said. Power outages in Pennsylvania Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, high winds overnight Sunday caused power outages early Monday, most of them in Pittsburgh and other parts of Allegheny County. Wind speeds of more than 97 kilometers per hour were reported in Pennsylvania as high winds also blew across Ohio and northern West Virginia. AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva in State College, Pennsylvania, said a strengthening low-pressure system ushered in the winds that downed trees and utility poles Sunday evening and into the night. Some 60,000 Pennsylvania utility customers were without power Monday morning. That number had dropped to about 13,000 by Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southerners-in-us-clean-up-after-tornadoes-sweep-region-/7919508.html	2024-12-31T01:04:13-08:00	
South Korean court issues detention warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved a detention warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law in December. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Yoon ignored three separate summonses to appear for questioning as part of that investigation, leading the court to issue Tuesday's warrant. Once Yoon is taken into custody, authorities will have 48 hours to decide whether to file for an arrest warrant or to release him, reported the Yonhap news agency. In a statement, Yoon's lawyers called the warrant 'illegal' and said they would file an injunction at the country's Constitutional Court to stop it. Yoon's legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. The arrest warrant is valid until next Monday. But it is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon's official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. Political pressure, however, is building for Yoon to comply with investigators. In an editorial Tuesday, the Chosun Ilbo, an influential conservative daily, said Yoon has 'no legal means' to block the enforcement of an arrest warrant. 'Blocking its execution would itself violate the law and could lead to a physical confrontation,' read the editorial, which urged Yoon to face the investigation 'with dignity.' Meanwhile, the acting head of South Korea's ruling conservative People Power Party on Tuesday called the detention warrant 'extremely regrettable.' South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 — the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s — but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. His opponents accuse Yoon of attempting to restore South Korea's military dictatorship, and say it is necessary to formally remove him from office as soon as possible. The path forward, however, remains uncertain. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon's removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-detention-warrant-for-yoon/7919499.html	2024-12-30T23:54:54-08:00	
US repatriates Tunisian detainee from Guantanamo Bay	The United States announced late Monday the repatriation of a Tunisian man who had been held at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi was one of the first to be held at the facility, which at one point housed hundreds of detainees following the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the United States. Yazidi was captured by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was among a group of about 30 fighters who had crossed the border from Afghanistan's Tora Bora region, according to Pentagon files. The Pentagon assessment said most of the group was identified as al-Qaida operatives or bodyguards of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Yazidi was never charged with a crime and cleared for transfer from Guantanamo in 2009, but there was no agreement in place for him to be sent to Tunisia or another country. The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress in January 2024 that officials had 'completed the requirements for responsible transfer' in consultation with Tunisia. The repatriation leaves 26 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 14 have been cleared for transfer. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-repatriates-tunisian-detainee-from-guantanamo-bay/7919488.html	2024-12-30T23:01:59-08:00	
Influential people who died in 2024	It was a life that took him from peanut farming to the presidency. While former President Jimmy Carter 's time in the White House lasted only one term, the decades afterward were defined by humanitarian work that affected people all around the world. Founding the Carter Center with his wife, Rosalynn, he became a global champion for democracy, human rights and public health. And he still took time to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Carter was the nation's longest-lived president when he died Sunday at age 100. But he was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2024. Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in February, was a fierce political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, crusading against corruption and staging protests against the Kremlin. He had been jailed since 2021 when he returned to Russia to face certain arrest after recovering in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. Other political figures who died this year include: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi; former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Vietnamese politician Nguyen Phu Trong; U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; pundit Lou Dobbs; Greek politician Vasso Papandreou; former U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, Jim Inhofe, Tim Johnson and Jim Sasser; Namibian President Hage Geingob; and former Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss. The year also brought the deaths of several rights activists, including the Reverends Cecil L. 'Chip' Murray and James Lawson Jr.; Dexter Scott King; Hydeia Broadbent; and David Mixner. Business leaders who died this year include Indian industrialist Ratan Tata; Home Depot co-founder Bernard 'Bernie' Marcus; financier Jacob Rothschild; and Daiso retail chain founder Hirotake Yano. O.J. Simpson's 'trial of the century' over the 1994 killings of his ex-wife and her friend exposed divisions over race and law enforcement and brought an intersection of sports, crime, entertainment and class that was hard to turn away from. His death in April ended a life that had become defined by scrutiny of the killings. Other noteworthy sports figures who died include basketball players Jerry West and Dikembe Mutombo; baseball players Willie Mays and Fernando Valenzuela; and gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi. The music industry lost a titan in producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. His many contributions included producing Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' album and working with hundreds of other musicians over a long and storied career. Other artists and entertainers who died this year include: actors James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera, Donald Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Lavin, Sandra Milo, Anouk Aimee, Carl Weathers, Joyce Randolph, Maggie Smith, Tony Todd, Shannen Doherty and Song Jae-lim; musicians Sergio Mendes, Toby Keith, Phil Lesh, Melanie, Dickey Betts, Françoise Hardy, Fatman Scoop, Duane Eddy and Frankie Beverly; filmmakers Roger Corman and Morgan Spurlock; authors Faith Ringgold, Nikki Giovanni and N.

Trinidad and Tobago declares state of emergency over gang violence	PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO — Trinidad and Tobago on Monday declared a state of emergency due to a spike in murders by criminal groups, a move that grants police the ability to conduct searches and arrests without a warrant over the next two days. 'The circumstances warranting the declaration of the public emergency are based on the advice of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service to the National Security Council of heightened criminal activity which endangers the public safety,' Prime Minister Keith Rowley's office said in a statement. Attorney General Stuart Young said the country recorded 61 murders in December, bringing the year's total up to 623 homicides, an increase from 577 homicides recorded in 2023 and 599 in 2022. Young, speaking at a press conference in the capital Port of Spain, said the public emergency would not include a curfew or restrict people's movements, to minimize the economic impact of the declaration. The authorization for police to carry out searches and arrests without a warrant may be extended up to seven days by a judge, Young said. At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders 'an epidemic' for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to 'hotspots' of crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7919436.html	2024-12-30T19:27:04-08:00	
Jimmy Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease his mission	JARWENG, SOUTH SUDAN — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite plaguing the world's poorest people. Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms up to 3 feet long. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters. Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only the second time in history. 'It'd be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life,' Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates. Carter died Sunday at age 100. Thanks to the Carters' efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14 human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center. The World Health Organization's target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner. That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn't seen Guinea worm infections since 2014 until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got infected. 'Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth,' said Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg. The center's staff and volunteers walked house to house distributing water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry the parasite. 'If someone's hurt, The Carter Center will help,' said villager Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog for symptoms. An audacious plan In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied, and heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of their citizens. Carter was still defining the center's mission when public health experts who had served in his administration approached him with a plan to eliminate the disease. Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second. 'President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far more in global health than we could do alone,' said Dr. William Foege, who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's smallpox eradication program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center's first executive director. Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm's toll on poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water. 'Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly awful disease,' said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign who led the center's health programs until 2015. 'He could sympathize with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to work.' Changing behaviors There's no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as they're slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks. So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors. Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources. The goal was to break the worm's life cycle — and therefore eliminate the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually exterminating Guinea worm altogether. The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within their borders. Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an end to river blindness by 2035. A personal mission Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its initiatives. Carter's fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally. 'He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted,' said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. 'The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference.' Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm. 'But there was no baby,' Carter wrote in his 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' 'Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple.' Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind. Worms in a war zone In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water filters and discover more endemic villages. Carter's efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what became South Sudan but also built trust across communities that resulted in a 'significant peace dividend,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young nation's Guinea worm eradication director. Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99% decline in less than two decades. Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed 'Ghana worm.' 'Ghana was deeply embarrassed,' Hopkins said. Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached zero infections in 2009. 'That was a thunderclap,' Hopkins said. 'It was important throughout Africa, throughout the global campaign.' To the last worm Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained focused: 'I'd like the last Guinea worm to die before I do,' he told reporters in 2015. Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive. Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13 total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate. 'These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate in,' said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. 'You need eyes and ears on the ground every single day.' The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases are so rare, Weiss said. 'I would still like to think we will beat the timeline,' Weiss said of the 2030 eradication goal. 'The Carter Center is committed to this, obviously, no matter what.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-made-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-his-mission-/7919423.html	2024-12-30T18:48:07-08:00	
South Korean court issues arrest warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law earlier this month. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Authorities sought the arrest warrant after Yoon ignored three summonses for questioning. Yoon’s legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. It is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon’s official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 – the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s – but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the martial law declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. The impeachment process is also filled with uncertainty. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon’s removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-/7919426.html	2024-12-30T18:26:41-08:00	
Judge denies sentencing delay for former US Senator Bob Menendez	NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, will be sentenced on corruption charges as scheduled at the end of January, and his wife's trial will be moved from January to February, a judge said Monday. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein in Manhattan rejected Menendez's request to delay his sentencing for his conviction on bribery and other charges until his wife finishes her trial on similar charges, possibly sometime in March. The Democrat's lawyers last week requested a new sentencing date on the grounds that the jury chosen to hear the case against his wife, Nadine Menendez, would be tainted if jurors heard about the outcome of the former senator's sentencing during the trial. Menendez, 70, was convicted in July of 16 corruption charges brought by prosecutors who asserted that he used his power in the Senate over a five-year stretch through 2022 to do favors that benefitted three New Jersey businessmen who paid him with gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. Two of the businessmen were convicted along with Menendez while a third pleaded guilty, cooperated with the government, and testified against him. Nadine Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Originally set to stand trial with her husband, her trial was put off after a breast cancer diagnosis led to surgery. Stein on Monday moved her January 21 trial to February 5. Her husband, as scheduled, will be sentenced on January 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-denies-sentencing-delay-for-former-us-senator-bob-menendez/7919421.html	2024-12-30T18:00:41-08:00	
Serbian court convicts parents of teen who fatally shot 10 at Belgrade school	BELGRADE, Serbia — A court in Serbia on Monday convicted the parents of a teenage boy who last year shot dead nine pupils and a school guard and wounded six more people in a school in central Belgrade. The Higher Court in Belgrade sentenced Vladimir Kecmanovic, father of the boy, to 14 years, six months in prison for 'grave acts against public safety' and for child neglect. The mother, Miljana Kecmanovic, was sentenced to three years in prison for child neglect but was acquitted on charges of illegal possession of weapons. The shooter, identified as Kosta Kecmanovic, was 13 years old when he committed the crime and therefore too young to face a trial, according to Serbian law. His parents were detained soon after the shooting and charged for failing to keep the weapons out of reach of their son. The massacre at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade on May 3, 2023, shocked the Balkan nation, which was used to crises but had not dealt with a mass school shooting. The couple's lawyer, Irina Borovic, said the verdict came as no surprise 'because public pressure was enormous, and the expectations were huge.' Borovic said she would appeal the verdicts. Ninela Radicevic, who lost her daughter in the shooting, said, 'We are not satisfied because no one was held responsible for the murder of nine children' and the school guard. The boy used his father's guns to shoot fellow pupils and others. He walked into the school and first opened fire in a hall before heading into a classroom, where he continued shooting. Elementary schools in Serbia enroll students 7 to 15 years old. Police have said that the teenager called them after the shooting and calmly said what he had done. He has been held in a specialized institution since the shooting and testified at his parents' trial. The proceedings were closed to the public except for the reading of the verdicts. Also convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison for false testimony was a shooting instructor who worked at a range where the boy practiced. The school shooting was followed the next day by another mass killing in villages outside Belgrade. Uros Blazic, 21, took an automatic rifle and opened fire at multiple locations, killing nine people and wounding 12. He was sentenced earlier this month to 20 years in prison. The back-to-back shootings triggered a wave of street protests and a crackdown on widespread illegal gun ownership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-court-convicts-parents-of-teen-who-fatally-shot-10-at-belgrade-school/7919416.html	2024-12-30T17:31:58-08:00	
Times Square ball takes final test for New Year's Eve	NEW YORK — The crystal-covered ball that descends down a pole in Times Square to ring in the new year was taken for a test run Monday, as New York City officials laid out their plans for the iconic New Year's Eve event. Officials flipped a switch to light up the dazzling geodesic sphere — weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal triangles — which then successfully ran up and down a 139-foot (42-meter) pole atop the One Times Square skyscraper. Monday's rehearsal was just one of many pre-ball drop promotional events: On Sunday, fistfuls of confetti were flung toward crowds in the square in anticipation of the 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of brightly colored paper that will fill the air at midnight on New Year's Eve. Some of those pieces will include wishes written by people ahead of 2025. 'This is the crossroads of the entire planet right here in New York City,' New York City Mayor Eric Adams said earlier Monday as he and law enforcement leaders discussed their plans for security at the celebration. 'People tune in at different locations and celebrate as we do the countdown for the New Year.' Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that although there were 'no specific credible threats' to the Times Square celebrations, 'the public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city.' Plans range from 'dedicated pickpocket teams' patrolling the square to sealing off all mailboxes and vending machines in the area. A New Year's Eve ball has dropped in Times Square for nearly 120 years, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 when nightly 'dimouts' occurred during World War II to protect the city from attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/times-square-ball-takes-final-test-for-new-year-s-eve-/7919403.html	2024-12-30T17:24:19-08:00

California to require insurers to boost home coverage in wildfire-prone areas	SACRAMENTO, California — Insurance companies that stopped providing home coverage to hundreds of thousands of Californians in recent years as wildfires became more destructive will have to again provide policies in fire-prone areas if they want to keep doing business in California under a state regulation announced Monday. The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, it would need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said. Major insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new policies in California because of fears of massive losses from wildfires and other natural disasters. In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office. Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers. 'This plan is of the insurance industry, by the insurance industry, and for the industry,' Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. The requirement is under review by the Office of Administrative Law before it takes effect within 30 days. 'Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,' Lara said in a statement. 'This is a historic moment for California.' Earlier rule The new rule is part of Lara's effort to persuade insurers to continue doing business in the nation's most populous state. He unveiled another rule earlier this month to let insurers consider climate change when setting their prices. Insurance companies had said that because they couldn't consider climate change in their rates, many chose to either pause or restrict new business in the state. The new rule to include climate change in rates will take effect later this week. The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, which often serves as the last resort when insurance companies stop providing coverage for those living in areas threatened by wildfires, Lara's office said. The plan could help a homeowner fulfill insurance requirements imposed by mortgage companies, but it is mainly designed as a temporary safety net with basic coverage until policyholders find a more permanent option. The number of people on California's FAIR plan more than doubled between 2020 and this year, reaching nearly 452,000 policies. Wildfires have always been part of life in California, where it rains for only a few months out of the year. But as the climate has gotten hotter and dryer, it has made those fires much larger and more intense. Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 14 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The 2018 fire in Paradise, California, killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes, and some residents have struggled to find home insurance since. Steve Crowder, the town's mayor, lost his house and business. Since then, his family has rebuilt their home but struggled to find insurance. The Crowders were forced to enroll in FAIR Plan earlier this month. Despite paying roughly $5,000, the mayor said his home is insured for roughly $100,000 less than its value and the house's contents are only half-covered. 'You couldn't rebuild what you got for what it's insured for,' he said. His constituents face similar problems. With policies skyrocketing from roughly $1,200 annually before the Camp Fire to $5,000 now — or even up to $20,000 a year for large homes — some have abandoned attempts to find coverage. In the years after the Camp Fire, Crowder said the town has successfully brought back some insurers after enacting new ordinances with high standards to keep structures safe, such as rules regarding clearances, vegetation and fences. While the mayor welcomed the state's new rules, he said he and his constituents are skeptical things will improve. 'Anything that will help get insurance in California, period, is helpful,' he said, but added: 'Let's wait and make sure it happens before we get excited.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-to-require-insurers-to-boost-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas/7919396.html	2024-12-30T16:44:07-08:00	
French prime minister unveils recovery plan for cyclone-devastated Mayotte	Paris — French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou arrived Monday in the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte to unveil a recovery plan three weeks after Cyclone Chido brought devastation. Bayrou, recently appointed prime minister, also updated the death toll to 39 but urged caution, saying the final number could range from 'a few dozen to a few hundred.' Days after the cyclone, Mayotte's prefect, François-Xavier Bieuville, had warned of the possibility of 'several hundred or even a few thousand' deaths. Bayrou's visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron as some Mayotte residents have alleged that the French government had long neglected them. The prime minister said a draft emergency law aiming to rebuild Mayotte within two years will be submitted to parliament in January. And he said local authorities agreed to ban the rebuilding of informal settlements, home to an unknown number of migrants from African nations in the region who hope to make their way to Europe. Many of the makeshift homes were torn apart by the storm. Bayrou outlined plans to restore electricity to all homes by late January, supported by 200 workers and emergency generators. Water production is expected to reach pre-cyclone levels by January 6, with upgrades to the distribution network set for completion by mid-2025. He also announced the deployment of 200 Starlink antennas for emergency communications. Education also faces disruption, with many schools destroyed. Classes will resume January 13, with special provisions for exam students. Temporary schooling in mainland France is also being considered. In Mozambique, also hit by Cyclone Chido, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said Sunday that 94 people had been killed. Malawi's presidential office said the death toll there had risen to 13.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prime-minister-unveils-recovery-plan-for-cyclone-devastated-mayotte-/7919385.html	2024-12-30T16:35:21-08:00	
Four UK Post Office scandal victims recognized in honors list	LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM — King Charles III announced awards for actors Stephen Fry and Carey Mulligan, as well as victims of Britain's Post Office scandal in the country's traditional New Year Honours on Tuesday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined U.K. television icon and writer Fry, 67, and former England football manager Gareth Southgate in being knighted in the latest list. Fry, best known for playing his idol Oscar Wilde in the 1997 movie Wilde and the hit British television comedy Blackadder was recognized for services to mental health awareness, the environment and to charity. Fry, who has a form of bipolar disorder, has spoken openly about his struggles with manic depression. He told the PA news agency that he felt 'startled and enchanted' after receiving the letter informing him of his knighthood. 'When you are recognized, it does make you feel a bit 'crikey,' but I think the most emotional thing is that when I think of my childhood, and my dreadful unhappiness and misery and stupidity, and everything that led to so many failures as a child,' Fry added. Khan, one Britain's most high-profile Asian-origin politicians, was honored for political and public service. The 54-year-old has led the U.K. capital since 2016 and earlier this year became the first London mayor to win a third term. Four victims of the Horizon IT scandal, in which hundreds of subpostmasters were wrongly convicted of fraud, theft and false accounting because of faulty software, were also honored. Lee Castleton, Jo Hamilton, Christopher Head and Seema Misra were recognized with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for their work campaigning for justice. The previous Conservative government unveiled legislation in March to exonerate those wrongly prosecuted and compensate them after a TV drama renewed focus on their plight. More than 1,200 people received honors in the latest list, which was decided by an honors committee. The king or other leading members of the royal family hand out the awards at ceremonies during the year. 'Each and every day, ordinary people go out and do extraordinary things for their communities,' said Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 'The New Year Honours List celebrates more of these unsung heroes, and I thank them for their incredible contribution,' he added. Mulligan received an award as a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) while Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro was made a Companion of Honor for services to literature. Southgate was knighted for services to football after leading England to the finals of the past two European Championships, as well as to the 2018 World Cup semifinal. His eight-year reign ended without a major trophy after England's 2-1 defeat to Spain in July's European final. Also honored were several British athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics this summer, including 800-meter gold medalist Keely Hodgkinson and two-time Olympic mountain bike champion Tom Pidcock. The king also personally honored two of his medical staff after he was diagnosed with cancer in February. His general practitioner, Douglas Glass, who was also attending Queen Elizabeth II at her death in Balmoral in September 2022, and his consultant physician, Richard Leach, were both awarded with levels of the Royal Victorian Order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-uk-post-office-scandal-victims-recognized-in-honors-list/7919383.html	2024-12-30T16:29:28-08:00	
Militancy surge in Pakistan kills 1,600 civilians, security forces	islamabad — A new report on Monday said escalating terrorist bombings and gun attacks in Pakistan resulted in the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians and security personnel in 2024. An independent think tank based in Islamabad released its annual report amid a wave of deadly violence in the country, primarily affecting the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan asserts that outlawed transnational groups have orchestrated violence from Afghan sanctuaries, with their activities intensifying since the Taliban’s August 2021 takeover of the neighboring country. The Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) stated in its Monday report that 60% of the overall casualties in 2024 were among civilians. It noted that the Pakistani military, intelligence, police and other law enforcement agencies 'suffered the highest number of terror attacks and fatalities in a decade.' According to the report, 685 security personnel have been killed since January 1, the most since Pakistan lost nearly 800 security personnel in militant attacks and counterterrorism operations in 2014. The resurgence of militancy is attributed to two key groups: Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Both organizations, designated as international terrorist organizations by the United Nations and the United States, routinely claim attacks staged against security forces and other targets. TTP is active mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while BLA and its allied ethnic Baloch separatist groups conduct insurgent attacks in Balochistan. While the Pakistani government did not immediately respond to the report, an army spokesman addressed a live televised news conference on Friday, revealing that '383 brave officers and soldiers were martyred' during counterterrorism operations across Pakistan in 2024. He did not, however, provide further details. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter Terrorism Department released a statement Monday reporting that militant attacks and security operations against insurgents resulted in the deaths of nearly 150 provincial police force members, with an additional 230 sustaining injuries. CRSS has documented approximately 250 fatalities among Pakistani security forces, including troops, in Balochistan alone. Remaining fatalities were attributed to Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as other regions. The nonprofit think tank stated that its report was based on open-source data and official statements. It routinely publishes reports highlighting the security situation in Pakistan and says on its website that the organization is working to promote research and nonpartisan analysis. The Taliban government has denied allegations that Afghan soil is being utilized by individuals permitted to threaten neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Last week, Taliban authorities announced that Pakistani jets had struck several locations within the eastern Afghan border province of Paktika, claiming the strikes resulted in nearly 50 fatalities. The statement identified victims as 'refugees' from Pakistan. While Islamabad has refrained from publicly responding to the alleged airstrikes, Pakistani security officials instantly provided anonymous confirmation of the cross-border bombardment, stating that the strikes targeted TTP hideouts, resulting in the elimination of over two dozen key militants and training infrastructure. The Taliban’s Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a statement claiming that its border forces retaliated by striking several targets on the Pakistani side of the border. Independent examination of both Pakistani and Afghan claims remains inconclusive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militancy-surge-in-pakistan-kills-1-600-civilians-security-forces-/7919142.html	2024-12-30T16:05:05-08:00

Mali court jails dissident over remarks about Burkina junta	Bamako, Mali — A Malian court jailed a political figure Monday for making critical remarks about the military rulers of neighboring Burkina Faso, a legal source and his family said. Issa Kaou N'Djim, who previously supported Malian junta leader Assimi Goita before distancing himself, made the comments during a program aired on local television station Joliba TV News. N'Djim was sentenced by a court in the capital, Bamako, to two years in prison, one of which was suspended. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1 million CFA francs ($1,600) by the national anti-cybercrime office, the legal source said. Mali authorities closed Joliba TV News in November because of the remarks and handed the private television station a six-month ban earlier this month. N'Djim's jailing follows the disappearance Saturday morning of another opposition figure, Ibrahim Naby Togola, who was due to hold a news briefing that day. According to a statement from his political party, Togola was abducted by 'unidentified armed individuals,' then taken to an unknown destination in a black vehicle with tinted windows. The 'Call of February 20, 2023 to save Mali ' opposition platform, which Togola belonged to, called for his 'immediate and unconditional release.' Mali and Burkina Faso have been ruled by military regimes since coups in 2020 and 2022, respectively, and are both embroiled in political and security crises. The military-led governments have taken repressive measures against the press, suspending a number of foreign media outlets and imprisoning or silencing journalists or critics. Together with fellow junta-led Niger, they formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) confederation. N'Djim previously was one of the vice presidents of the National Transitional Council (CNT), the legislative body of Mali 's military rulers. He later said he favored a rapid end to the so-called transitional period intended to return power to elected civilians. In December 2021, N'Djim was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence for 'undermining the credit of the state,' following comments deemed 'subversive' on social media. He was dismissed from the CNT and prevented from leaving the country several times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-court-jails-dissident-over-remarks-about-burkina-junta/7919123.html	2024-12-30T15:26:37-08:00

December border arrests remain down, ending Biden's term at lowest level	SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as president hasn't happened. There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning, suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the count is preliminary and has not been made public. December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said. It also signals that the final full month of President Joe Biden's presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in office. Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that said 'swift and effective implementation' of asylum restrictions in June resulted in another month below the 2019 average. 'This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement, extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under our laws,' Mayorkas said. Arrests fell by about half from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum limits. Texas' Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona, was fourth. For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration's approach to create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Most legal entries are done through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450 slots a day. Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures, touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/december-border-arrests-remain-down-ending-biden-s-term-at-lowest-level-/7919120.html	2024-12-30T15:22:38-08:00	
Losing your kids to doom scrolling? Greece is building government app for that	ATHENS, GREECE — Greece announced plans on Monday to enhance parental oversight of mobile devices in 2025 through a government-operated app that will help get digital age verification and browsing controls. Dimitris Papastergiou, the minister of digital governance, said the Kids Wallet app, due to launch in March, was aimed at safeguarding children under the age of 15 from the risks of excessive and inappropriate internet use. The app will be run by a widely used government services platform and operate in conjunction with an existing smartphone app for adults to carry digital identification documents. 'It's a big change,' Papastergiou told reporters, adding that the app would integrate advanced algorithms to monitor usage and apply strict authentication processes. 'The Kids Wallet application will do two main things: It will make parental control much easier, and it will be our official national tool for verifying the age of users,' he said. A survey published this month by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children ages 9-12 have access to the internet via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content. Many lack awareness of basic safety tools such as the block and report buttons, authors of the study said. Papastergiou said the government was hoping to have the children's app preinstalled on smartphones sold in Greece by the end of 2025. While facing criticism from some digital rights and religious groups, government-controlled apps and online services — many introduced during the pandemic — are generally popular in Greece, as they are seen as a way of bypassing historically slow bureaucratic procedures. The planned online child protection measures would go further than regulations already in place in several European countries by introducing more direct government involvement. They will also help hold social media platforms more accountable for enforcing age controls, Papastergiou said. 'What's the elephant in the room? Clearly, it's how we define and verify a person's age,' he said. 'When you have an [online] age check, you might have a 14-year-old claiming they are 18. Or you could have someone who actually is a genuine 20-year-old. … Now we can address that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/losing-your-kids-to-doom-scrolling-greece-is-building-a-government-app-for-that/7919111.html	2024-12-30T15:03:53-08:00	
Hotel fire in popular Bangkok tourist area kills 3 foreigners	Bangkok — A fire broke out at a hotel near Bangkok's Khao San Road, a popular tourist destination, killing three foreigners and injuring several other people, Thai police said Monday. The three who died in the fire Sunday night were all foreign tourists, Police Colonel Sanong Saengmanee told The Associated Press. One was found dead at the scene and the other two died after being transported to the hospital. Police later identified the dead as a Brazilian woman, a Ukrainian man and an American man. Five people were hospitalized, including a Japanese woman in critical condition. The others were identified as a Japanese man, two Germans and a Thai electrician. The fire erupted on the 5th floor of the six-story Ember Hotel, police said. Khao San Road is a popular backpacker street in the Thai capital that's also known for its lively nightlife. The flames were eventually contained, and the cause of the blaze is under investigation. Seventy-five people were staying at the hotel at the time of the fire. Sreekanth Kolamala, a 37-year-old Indian national who lives in Singapore and was in Thailand on vacation, witnessed the rescue operation and said that firefighters 'broke the glass over there to try to pull people out.' Sanga Ruangwattanakul, the president of the Khao San Road Business Association, stood outside The Ember Hotel on Monday, looking at the damage. He said 20,000 people were expected at a New Year's Eve countdown event Tuesday night. 'Now everybody’s scared about what happened and they’re scared it will affect the event tomorrow. But definitely there’s no worry because we already had a meeting with the police station and we have over 150 police and district staff to cover on Khao San Road for security,' he said. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt also emphasized the importance of safety following the incident, especially as New Year's Eve approaches, with fireworks and other celebrations planned across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hotel-fire-in-popular-bangkok-tourist-area-kills-3-foreigners/7919114.html	2024-12-30T15:00:13-08:00	
In Carter's hometown, a long-anticipated goodbye begins	PLAINS, GEORGIA — In Jimmy Carter's tiny hometown of Plains, Georgia on Monday, the former U.S. president's death was only beginning to sink in, even if friends and neighbors have been bracing for it since he went into hospice care nearly two years ago. Those in the rural hamlet — a half block of buildings nestled in the shadow of massive agricultural silos — said the centenarian's death was sad, but in the same breath they recounted fond memories of time spent with the former U.S. leader and global humanitarian. Carter's commitment to Plains, where he was born 100 years ago and died Sunday at the modest home he had shared with his wife Rosalynn, is made clear by its residents — most knew him personally or have a family member who did. 'It'll always be Jimmy Carter's hometown,' Kelly Kight, who was born and raised in Plains, population approximately 600, told AFP as she placed commemorative bows near her flower shop on the main strip. She said that more than an occasion for mourning, it was a day for remembrance of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his humanitarian work in particular. Electric leaf blowers and tree trimmers provided a background chorus for the town, accustomed to gussying up quickly since it was first thrust into the national spotlight as Carter ran for president nearly 50 years ago and most recently when he began hospice care. 'When he entered hospice, it kind of became a waiting game for all of the hometown people here in the community,' said Kight, whose family owned a peanut warehouse across from the Carter's and whose father grew up alongside the Carter children. Carter, who had an unlikely political ascent from peanut farmer to the Oval Office, is almost omnipresent in Plains — his boyhood home, high school and the former train depot which served as his 1976 presidential campaign headquarters are now museums under the National Park Service. The town's main drag is festooned with an enormous banner heralding Carter as the 39th president, while a goofy peanut statue with Carter's trademark grin sits near his church, Maranatha Baptist. There, he welcomed visitors from around the world as he taught Sunday school into his 90s. ‘A very fine gentleman’ Carter's death has long been anticipated — he was last seen in public looking very frail at his wife's funeral in November 2023, after 77 years of marriage. His funeral schedule will include a stop at his boyhood farm, before his remains are taken onward to Atlanta and Washington, then returned to his hometown for interment. Kimberly Franklin, who also grew up in Plains, was leaving the Dollar General grocery store Monday, where she would sometimes encounter the Carters shopping like everyday people. 'I am very sad,' the residential nurse, 56, told AFP, adding that Carter was just 'an awesome guy.' Like most in Plains, she had a deeply personal memory of Carter, a profoundly religious Baptist who attended her baptism. Several blocks away, Plains resident Johnny Jones sat in a rocking chair on his porch, across from the high school Carter attended and in clear view of downtown. He was waiting for the bustle to begin. Jones watched as the town came to a standstill for Rosalynn Carter's funeral and as swarms of journalists descended on Plains when Jimmy Carter announced his hospice care. Jones recounted with a twinkle in his eye that the media waited two weeks for Carter to die, then turned around and left. 'I thought he was a very fine gentleman,' said Jones, an 85-year-old military retiree who liked Carter. 'He did a lot for Plains.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-carter-s-hometown-a-long-anticipated-goodbye-begins-/7919087.html	2024-12-30T14:42:04-08:00	
Scores of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners head back home after swap	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and Russia carried out a new exchange of prisoners of war on Monday, with the two sides bringing home a combined total of more than 300 former captives. Kyiv brought home 189 former captives, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Defense Ministry said, while the Russian ministry said 150 Russian servicemen were returning home. The Russian ministry said the captives had been released in Belarus, Moscow's close ally in the 34-month-old war with Ukraine, and would be transferred to Russia. Reuters Television footage in Ukraine showed waiting spouses and some servicemen, many wrapped in blue and yellow national flags, weeping openly as they were reunited well after dark outside a building. A child's incredulous voice resounded over a mobile telephone: 'Dad, is that you?' 'My son is 5 years old now. The last time I saw him, he was 2 years old,' said Serhii, who was captured by Russian forces at the Azovstal steel mill in the southern port of Mariupol, which withstood a siege for nearly three months in 2022. 'That's why my son probably didn't recognize me. I used to have a beard and hair. I lost 20 kg' [44 pounds]. For some former captives, the return to freedom involved adjustment. 'Even now, I'm holding my hands behind my back. It has become a habit of mine,' said journalist Roman Borshch, 29. 'Now, I have to get used to being a free person again.' Video posted by the Russian Defense Ministry showed smiling servicemen on a bus, some calling their families. 'We'll soon be home. How are the children? How is our boy?' one man said. 'I am overwhelmed by emotion,' said another. 'I still can't quite believe that this has happened, that I am back home, that the ministry made such efforts, that we are remembered and valued.' Zelenskyy thanked United Arab Emirates authorities and other partners for facilitating the swap. The UAE acknowledged it helped arrange the exchange. 'The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us. And today is one of such days: our team managed to bring 189 Ukrainians home,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. There was no immediate explanation for why more Ukrainians than Russians were listed as released. The freed Ukrainians included civilians who had been in Russian captivity. Zelenskyy said the returning Ukrainians included soldiers, sergeants and officers from front-line areas, and two civilians who had been captured in Mariupol. Denys Prokopenko, commander of the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade that defended the Azovstal mill, said 11 of his men were among those returning. Prokopenko was brought home in an earlier swap. The Ukrainian body overseeing prisoner swaps said it was the 59th exchange between the two sides since Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor. The swap brought to 3,956 the number of Ukrainian detainees brought home. It said those brought home this year included Ukrainian nationals serving what it described as 'so-called sentences' imposed by Russian courts for various offenses. In the last swap in October, also carried out with assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Ukraine each brought home 95 detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scores-of-ukrainian-and-russian-prisoners-head-back-home-after-swap-/7919089.html	2024-12-30T14:40:59-08:00	
US Treasury: Chinese hackers remotely accessed workstations, documents	WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday. The department did not provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but it said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that 'at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.' 'Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,' the department said. 'Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.' The department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key used by the vendor that helped it override the system and gain remote access to several employee workstations. The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee. The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-chinese-hackers-remotely-accessed-workstations-documents-/7919093.html	2024-12-30T14:39:25-08:00	
US agency takes steps to protect Nevada mountains from energy development	The Biden administration on Monday took steps to protect the Ruby Mountains in northeast Nevada from oil, gas and geothermal development for 20 years. The Interior Department said it had approved an application by the U.S. Forest Service to withdraw 264,442 acres of federal lands in the Ruby Mountains from mineral and geothermal leasing. The application's approval removes the lands from development for up to two years and kicks off a 90-day period for the public to comment on the proposed 20-year withdrawal. The proposal comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to step up domestic oil and gas production, succeeds President Joe Biden, a Democrat who has sought to conserve large amounts of public land. The lands would remain open to mining claims, the Interior Department said. 'The Ruby Mountains are cherished by local communities for their scenic value, cultural heritage, numerous wildlife and benefit to the local economy through a thriving outdoor recreation industry,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. 'Today, we are taking an important and sensible step to pause new oil and gas leasing to ensure that we have the science and public input necessary to inform proposed protections of the Ruby Mountains area for future generations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-takes-steps-to-protect-nevada-mountains-from-energy-development/7919099.html	2024-12-30T14:37:15-08:00	
Finland discovers anchor ‘dragging track’ amid suspicions of Russian subsea sabotage	LONDON — Finnish authorities have discovered anchor drag marks running for several kilometers across the Baltic seabed as they probe the recent severing of important power and internet cables. 'With the underwater operations, we have been able to identify the dragging track at the seabed from the beginning to the end,' said Detective Chief Inspector Sami Paila of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation in a Sunday press release. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length. For the time being, the possible location where the anchor came off has not been established.' The announcement marks the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent months and comes as NATO warns of a growing threat of unconventional Russian attacks in the region. The underwater Estlink 2 power cable linking Finland and Estonia was damaged last Wednesday, along with several data cables. Estonia’s power supply was significantly reduced because of the damage. On Thursday, Finnish police and coast guard officers boarded the Eagle S, a Cook Islands-registered tanker carrying Russian oil from the port of Ust-Luga before sailing it into Finnish territorial waters. The vessel is currently being held off the town of Porvoo, 40 kilometers east of Helsinki. Its crew is being detained on suspicion of 'aggravated criminal mischief.' Russian officials have said nothing about the Finnish accusations or impounding of the Eagle S. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Pesokov said Friday, 'I can't say anything for sure. This is a highly specific issue, which is hardly the prerogative of the presidential administration.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday it was too early to determine whether the damage was deliberate. 'Four cables have been broken,' Stubb told reporters in Helsinki. 'We were able to get the situation under control and locate the ship in question, bring it to Finnish waters and begin a criminal proceeding. There has been substantial damage through the cables.' Finland suspects the Eagle S is part of Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of aging vessels used to evade Western sanctions on its oil exports, imposed in the wake of Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The damage to the Estlink 2 cable is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the Baltic Sea. In November, a Chinese bulk carrier, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of severing two fiber-optic data cables in Swedish waters with its anchor. China refused to allow a Swedish prosecutor to board the vessel, which has since departed the Baltic. Last year, the Balticconnector gas pipeline linking Estonia and Finland was damaged. Ten months later, China said a Hong Kong-registered vessel had caused the damage in a storm. Finland was skeptical of the admission. Estonia has called for international maritime laws to be updated to protect infrastructure. 'The situation that is now at the Baltic Sea, where the anchors have been dropping several times in a row — it can’t be by accident,' Estonian Justice Minister Liisa Pakosta told Reuters. 'These kinds of situations are not typical, not only for our region, but also for other regions in the world. So, [given] the technological developments that we have, we think that it is a good idea to look over international law to make these investigations more smooth.' NATO said Friday it would boost its presence in the Baltic Sea. The alliance staged maritime drills in the Baltic earlier last month as a show of force amid escalating tensions with Moscow. However, formulating a response to unconventional — also known as hybrid — attacks is complex, said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, an analyst with the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 'If there begins to be clear attribution by states against other state actors, then just taking it on the chin and being resilient in the long run is going to be probably deeply unsatisfying,' he told VOA. '[But] if you attribute it or you blame someone, will you intensify the circle? And what are you going to do about it? Because you clearly cannot use the same ‘retributionary tools,’ as it were, against Russia and China. At least not yet, I think.' Estonian authorities said it could take until August to repair the damage to the Estlink 2 cable. The Estonian navy and Swedish coast guards have stepped up surveillance patrols in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-discovers-anchor-dragging-track-amid-suspicions-of-russian-subsea-sabotage/7919073.html	2024-12-30T14:12:23-08:00

Venezuela fines TikTok $10 million over viral challenge deaths	Caracas, Venezuela — Venezuela's highest court Monday fined TikTok $10 million in connection with viral challenges that authorities say left three adolescents dead from intoxication by chemical substances. Supreme Tribunal of Justice Judge Tania D'Amelio said that the popular video-sharing app had been negligent in failing to implement 'necessary and adequate measures' to stop the spread of content encouraging the challenges. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, was ordered to open an office in the South American country and given eight days to pay the fine or face 'appropriate' measures. Venezuela would use the money to 'create a TikTok victims fund, intended to compensate for the psychological, emotional and physical damages to users, especially if these users are children and adolescents,' D'Amelio said. The company told the court that it 'understands the seriousness of the matter,' she said. According to Venezuelan authorities, three adolescents died and 200 were intoxicated in schools across the country after ingesting chemical substances as part of social media 'challenges.' TikTok's huge global success has been partly built on the success of its challenges — a call that invites users to create videos featuring dances, jokes or games that sometimes go viral. The app has been accused of putting users in danger with the spread of hazardous challenge videos. TikTok's official policy prohibits videos promoting self-harm and suicide. In November, President Nicolas Maduro threatened 'severe measures' against TikTok if it did not remove content related to what he called 'criminal challenges.' Parliament is considering laws regulating social networks, which Maduro said after his disputed reelection in July was being used to promote 'hate,' 'fascism' and 'division.' He has accused Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of social media platform X, of orchestrating 'attacks against Venezuela.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-fines-tiktok-10-million-over-viral-challenge-deaths-/7919020.html	2024-12-30T13:16:50-08:00

VOA Mandarin: Outlook for US-China relations in the New Year	As former President Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, Reuters reported on Dec. 24 that China will issue a record 3 trillion yuan in government bonds next year in an effort to rescue its crisis-stricken economy and mitigate the impact of potential significant tariff hikes by Trump. This marks the latest sign of China’s concern that bilateral relations may quickly plunge to a new low during Trump's second term. For a long time, a basic assumption about U.S.-China relations has been that even when relations deteriorate, they won’t fall too far. Looking ahead to the new year, Trump is set to bring an unusually hard-line, hawkish team on China into the White House.

Biden declares day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter	Washington — President Joe Biden has declared Jan. 9 a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter and announced Monday that all federal government offices would be closed that day as a show of respect for the 39th U.S. president, who died Sunday at the age of 100. 'I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr.,' Biden said in a formal declaration issued late Sunday. 'I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.' Biden inadvertently revealed, in March of last year at a national Democratic party event, that Carter – also a Democrat – had asked him to deliver his eulogy. In his statement late Sunday, Biden described Carter as 'a man of character, courage, and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him as one of the most influential statesmen in our history.' He continued: 'He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision lifted our nation and changed our world.' The solemn event Jan. 9 in the nation’s capital will draw all the living American presidents and a host of dignitaries. Biden also ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the date of Carter’s death at public buildings, military posts and overseas U.S. government buildings. Biden has bestowed upon Carter a state funeral, which is a three-stage, multi-day event coordinated by the U.S. military that includes observances in the capital, plus ceremonies in the home state of the deceased. Carter has repeatedly expressed his wish to be buried in his front yard in the small town of Plains, Georgia beside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn. She died in 2023. Carter was in hospice care for two years before his own death, and his death at 100 made him the longest-living former president in U.S. history. In Washington, services are likely to be held at the imposing Washington National Cathedral, which has played host to several previous state funerals, including that of former presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter’s funeral is likely to be attended by all four living American presidents — that list includes Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, former and future President Donald Trump, and Biden. Biden, at 82, is now the eldest statesman of that group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-declares-day-of-mourning-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7919000.html	2024-12-30T12:45:26-08:00

Syria’s election timetable sparks debate	WASHINGTON — Syrians and legal experts have been reacting to comments by Syria’s de facto leader that new elections following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime could take four years and drafting a new constitution up to three years. In an interview with the Saudi news channel al-Arabiya, Ahmad al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, stated on Sunday that holding elections in Syria requires sufficient time to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive political process. His remarks ignited a debate among Syrians and legal experts who believe he and his group, Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), could exploit the transition period to consolidate their control over the country, or that the proposed timeline is realistic given Syria’s fragmented state after more than a decade of conflict. HTS, formerly al-Qaida’s branch in Syria, led the 11-day rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime on Dec. 8. HTS has controlled an enclave in the country’s northwestern province of Idlib in recent years. Anwar al-Bunni, co-founder and executive director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research, described the proposed timetable for a new constitution and elections as logical. 'We cannot talk about a new constitution and elections while Syrians are scattered all over the world,' he told VOA, referring to those Syrians who have been displaced due to the country’s 13-year conflict. According to the United Nations, over 14 million Syrians have left their homes since 2011, with 7.2 million internally displaced, while nearly 5.5 million are refugees in neighboring countries and elsewhere. Bunni said Syrian refugees should return home to secure decent shelter and basic services, enabling them to contemplate and discuss their political future. 'A 3- to 5-year period is realistic before Syrians are fully prepared to vote and participate in politics,' he said. 'We need an independent election commission and political parties, and for that to happen, you need a great deal of preparation.' Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian American activist who serves as a parliamentarian and director of policy at the World Liberty Congress, agreed that a 4-year wait before holding elections was not unreasonable, 'as long as the transitional government is sufficiently diverse, and the interim governance structure remains responsive to criticism while respecting basic human rights. 'However, if this 4-year period is used to fill key positions and institutions with Islamist loyalists to HTS and Al-Sharaa, we may be looking at a planned takeover of governance — a shift from one form of sectarian authoritarianism, justified in the name of protecting minorities, to another, justified by claims of majority entitlement,' Abdulhamid wrote on X, adding that 'the composition of the upcoming transitional government will be a key indicator of where things are headed.' HTS has appointed a caretaker government composed of loyalists to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. In his al-Arabiya interview, al-Sharaa said a national dialogue conference, tentatively scheduled to be held in January, will determine the structure of the transitional government. Bunni said there must be a legal framework for the country to function in the transitional period, noting the need for a provisional constitution. Other experts argue that establishing a participatory system of governance for all Syrians should begin by including all stakeholders in the transitional process. 'Syrians are not naive,' said Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice. 'They know where HTS comes from, and they would want to ensure that they have a say during this crucial time.' He told VOA he didn’t believe Syrians were as overly concerned about the 4-year timetable. Instead, their focus was on what might unfold during that period.

Jimmy Carter's passing met with mixed reactions in China, Taiwan	Taipei, Taiwan — The passing of former United States President Jimmy Carter was met with mixed reactions in China and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping praised him for helping to establish diplomatic ties between Beijing and Washington while some in Taiwan remain critical of his decision to sever official ties with the island to this day. In a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, Xi expressed his 'deep condolences' and described Carter as 'the driving force behind the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.' Former President Carter 'made important contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations and the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries,' China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV cited Xi as saying. 'China-U.S. ties are among the most import bilateral relationships in the world,' Xi said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to advance bilateral relations. During Carter’s time in office between 1977 and 1981, the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with China, advancing the groundwork laid by former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. In 1979, his administration recognized the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged Beijing’s position that Taiwan is a part of China. He also agreed to sever official ties with Taiwan, charting a new course in what would later become one of the world’s most complicated and consequential relationships. Much like Xi, many Chinese commentators and internet users praised Carter’s contribution to normalizing U.S.-China relations. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said Carter helped to lay the foundation of the 'friendly and cooperative relationship' between China and the U.S. by acknowledging China’s position on Taiwan. While 'his starting point is to safeguard the interests of the United States, during his term, China and the United States of America's common interests have been highlighted and highlighted,' he wrote in a statement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Other Chinese internet users also characterized Carter as being more friendly to China than other U.S. leaders. 'Of all the living former U.S. presidents, he is one of the friendlier to China,' Chinese netizen 'Sheng Yuan Ran Dong' from Heilongjiang province wrote on Weibo. 'He was a good pacifist. He opened the floodgates of history by establishing diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. His good qualities are truly worth highlighting,' Chinese internet user 'Abu from the magic forest' from Jiangxi Province wrote on Weibo. Lu Chao, the director of Liaoning University’s Institute of American and East Asian Studies, said Carter not only facilitated the establishment of U.S.-China relations, he also maintained very good relations with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 'Former President Carter made the right choice that was in line with the trend of global development, the fundamental interests of the United States, and the interests of China. It is still praised by Chinese and American people,' he told VOA. Mixed reactions in Taiwan While reactions from China to Carter’s passing were largely positive, perceptions about the former U.S. president’s complicated legacy in Taiwan were mixed. In a short post on social media platform X, Taiwan’s Presidential Office extended 'sincere condolences' to Carter’s family and the American people. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), said on X that while Carter will be remembered in Taiwan 'for his decision to derecognize the Republic of China' — Taiwan’s official name — they 'admire his advocacy worldwide for affordable housing, conflict resolution, refugees, and other causes.' In contrast to the moderate official response, some Taiwanese internet users criticized the former U.S. president for allowing China to become a major threat to Taiwan. While 'the U.S. is now Taiwan’s strong ally, [Carter and Kissinger] are the ones who made China so difficult to deal with. From the two of them to the Obama era, Washington’s pro-China approach allowed China to build economic growth for decades and that’s the reason why the Chinese Communist Party can keep bullying Taiwan,' Taiwanese internet user Pbtato Hsieh wrote in a Facebook post. After the Carter administration severed ties with Taiwan in 1979, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), later the same year, which allows Washington to maintain close unofficial ties with Taipei while requiring the U.S. to 'provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character' to 'a sufficient self-defense capacity.' The TRA also reaffirmed the United States commitment to preserving the human rights of the people of Taiwan. At the time the legislation was signed into law by then President Carter, Taiwan was under martial law and under the control of one single party, the KMT, which was led by Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan continued under martial law until 1989 and held its first direct presidential elections in 1996. While Carter signed the TRA into law, some Taiwanese analysts say the former president shouldn’t be credited for providing the architecture that upholds the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the U.S. today. 'It was because the government in Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and some grassroots Taiwanese American organizations maintained good relations with members of the U.S. Congress, so the Congress passed a piece of legislation that was more favorable toward Taiwan,' Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 'The Taiwan Relations Act was not directly related to Carter,' he added. Despite his complicated legacy of handling Washington’s relations with Taiwan, other experts say Carter’s decision to sign the TRA into law still helped to build the 'first blocks of today’s U.S.-Taiwan relationship.' 'The de facto relationship that the U.S. and Taiwan have today began with him,' said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. 'I don't think he was the one who sat down and wrote the TRA, but he most certainly is the one who saw through the process of creating this new relationship with Taiwan after the recognition switch,' he told VOA by phone.

Over 13,000 Mozambicans flee to Malawi amid post-election violence	NSANJE, MALAWI — Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. The latest statistics show that Malawi has received about 13,000 refugees from Mozambique in recent weeks, many of them women and children. Authorities say that the number is expected to rise. Sofia Jimu, the traditional leader of the Tengani area in Mozambique, is among those who fled to Malawi. She said a lack of food is the main challenge at the evacuation center where she is staying, adding that three children collapsed because of hunger in just one day. However, she said, the following day she was given 150 bags of maize flour and four bags of beans to distribute to people at the center. The political tension in Mozambique escalated after the Constitutional Council confirmed Daniel Chapo, presidential candidate for the ruling Frelimo Party, as the winner of the Oct. 9 election. Runner-up Venancio Mondlane, presidential candidate for the opposition Podemos party, disputes the results. Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, says more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October. Dominic Mwandira, the commissioner for Nsanje district in Malawi, told VOA on Sunday that the biggest challenge is a lack of resources to take care of the asylum-seekers currently staying in makeshift camps near the border. 'In terms of food and then nonfood items, tents, issues of water, they are several,' he said. 'But we are happy that partners have started coming in, the government is coming in to support these people.' He said organizations offering help include the Malawi Red Cross Society and Plan International. Jane Mweziwina, a program area manager for Plan International in Malawi, told reporters they are working to ensure new arrivals are protected. 'You know women, people with disabilities and children are always vulnerable when they are in a crisis like this. So, our advice to the leadership is that they take special consideration for these special groups of people in terms of accommodation, security, even in terms of food,' she said. Malawi authorities say plans are under way to relocate asylum-seekers to a more spacious center. In the meantime, Malawi’s Department for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Malawi are conducting a joint assessment to identify the needs of asylum-seekers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-13-000-mozambicans-flee-to-malawi-amid-post-election-violence/7918832.html	2024-12-30T10:44:33-08:00	
Five years on, WHO urges China to share COVID origins data	Geneva — The World Health Organization on Monday implored China to share data and access to help understand how COVID-19 began, five years on from the start of the pandemic that upended the planet. COVID-19 killed millions of people, shredded economies and crippled health systems. 'We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative,' the WHO said in a statement. 'Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.' The WHO recounted how on Dec. 31, 2019, its country office in China picked up a media statement from the health authorities in Wuhan concerning cases of 'viral pneumonia' in the city. 'In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, COVID-19 came to shape our lives and our world,' the U.N. health agency said. 'As we mark this milestone, let's take a moment to honor the lives changed and lost, recognize those who are suffering from COVID-19 and Long COVID, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from COVID-19 to build a healthier tomorrow.' Earlier this month, the WHO's Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the issue of whether the world was better prepared for the next pandemic than it was for COVID-19. 'The answer is yes, and no,' he told a press conference. 'If the next pandemic arrived today, the world would still face some of the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that gave COVID-19 a foothold five years ago. 'But the world has also learnt many of the painful lessons the pandemic taught us and has taken significant steps to strengthen its defenses against future epidemics and pandemics.' In December 2021, spooked by the devastation caused by COVID, countries decided to start drafting an accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The WHO's 194 member states negotiating the treaty have agreed on most of what it should include but are stuck on the practicalities. A key fault-line lies between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors and poorer countries wary of being sidelined when the next pandemic strikes. While the outstanding issues are few, they include the heart of the agreement: the obligation to quickly share emerging pathogens, and then the pandemic-fighting benefits derived from them such as vaccines. The deadline for the negotiations is May 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-years-on-who-urges-china-to-share-covid-origins-data/7918778.html	2024-12-30T10:08:32-08:00	
India rocket launches space docking mission	NEW DELHI — India launched a rocket Monday carrying two small spacecraft to test docking in space, a critical step for the country's dreams of a space station and a manned moon mission. The mission is 'vital for India's future space ambitions,' Jitendra Singh, the country's science and technology minister, said in a statement ahead of the launch, which was broadcast live by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced plans last year to send a man to the moon by 2040. The PSLV-C60 rocket, which blasted off Monday evening at the Sriharikota launch site with shooting flames as it soared into the night sky, included two 220-kilogram (485-pound) satellites. ISRO has dubbed the mission SpaDeX, or Space Docking Experiment. 'PSLV-C60 successfully launches SpaDeX and 24 payloads,' it said in a statement. The mission is intended to 'develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft,' it added. The technology is 'essential' for India's moon plans, it added, calling it a 'key technology for future human spaceflight and satellite servicing missions.' It will involve a 'precision rendezvous,' maneuvering satellites orbiting Earth at speeds of 28,800 kilometers per hour (17,895 miles per hour). Their relative velocities will be reduced to 0.036 kph (0.22 mph) to 'merge to form a single unit in Space,' ISRO said. The world's most populous nation has a comparatively low-budget aerospace program that is rapidly closing in on the milestones set by global space powers. 'Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology,' ISRO added, after Russia, the United States and China. India has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space program growing considerably in size and momentum, matching the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag. In August 2023, it became just the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the moon after Russia, the United States and China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-rocket-launches-space-docking-mission/7918747.html	2024-12-30T09:52:50-08:00

Argentine judge charges 5 people over death of former One Direction star Liam Payne	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs. A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison — a form of pre-trial detention — was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October. The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge. The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison. In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names. Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding. Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had 'traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant' in the moments before his death. Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious. Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide. One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne — like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson — pursued a solo career.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-charges-5-people-over-death-of-former-one-direction-star-liam-payne-/7918726.html	2024-12-30T09:34:29-08:00	
State funeral to be held for former President Jimmy Carter	Atlanta, GA. — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. A state funeral will be held January 9 for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who died Sunday at the age of 100. U.S. President Joe Biden scheduled the state funeral for Carter to be held the same day as National Day of Mourning. Biden has also directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days in honor of Carter. Carter was a peanut farmer and a Georgia state governor before becoming president. When he took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s 'commitment to international peace and human rights. 'President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,' Guterres said in a statement. 'His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.' The White House released a statement from President Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday. It said, 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: 'The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S.-backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage; 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the Earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, only 13 cases of Guinea worm were recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 77-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Although his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-funeral-to-be-held-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7918676.html	2024-12-30T09:26:02-08:00	
Appeals court upholds $5 million award in sexual abuse verdict against president-elect Trump	New York — A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury's finding in a civil case that Donald Trump sexually abused a columnist in an upscale department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a written opinion upholding the $5 million award that the Manhattan jury granted to E. Jean Carroll for defamation and sexual abuse. The longtime magazine columnist had testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack after they playfully entered the store's dressing room. Trump skipped the trial after repeatedly denying the attack ever happened. But he briefly testified at a follow-up defamation trial earlier this year that resulted in an $83.3 million award. The second trial resulted from comments then-President Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir. In its ruling, a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected claims by Trump's lawyers that trial Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had made multiple decisions that spoiled the trial, including his decision to allow two other women who had accused Trump of sexually abusing them to testify. The judge also had allowed the jury to view the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump boasted in 2005 about grabbing women's genitals because when someone is a star, 'you can do anything.' 'We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,' the 2nd Circuit said. 'Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.' In September, both Carroll, 81, and Trump, 78, attended oral arguments by the 2nd Circuit. Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement that Trump was elected by voters who delivered 'an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.' Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer who represented Carroll during the trial and is not related to the judge, said in a statement: 'Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.' The first jury found in May 2023 that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her with comments he made in October 2022. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million. In January, a second jury awarded Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Trump testified for under three minutes at the second trial and was not permitted to challenge conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-upholds-5-million-award-in-sexual-abuse-verdict-against-president-elect-trump-/7918643.html	2024-12-30T08:59:53-08:00	
Trump endorses Johnson to stay on as House Speaker after government funding turmoil	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump is endorsing House Speaker Mike Johnson as he prepares to fight to keep his role leading Republicans in Congress. Trump said Monday in a post on his social media network that Johnson 'is a good, hard working, religious man' and said the Louisiana Republican 'will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.' 'Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement,' Trump wrote. Johnson's continued leadership seemed in jeopardy after a fight over a federal funding plan put the government at risk for a pre-Christmas shutdown. Though a deal was reached, the dispute showed the limits of Johnson's influence and exposed cracks in his party's support. The speaker's first two funding plans collapsed as Trump, who does not take the oath of office until Jan. 20, interceded with calls to suspend or lift the government debt ceiling. Johnson, who has worked hard to stay close to Trump, convinced the president-elect that he would meet his demands to raise the debt limit in 2025. Trump had remained quiet about Johnson's fate before a Jan. 3 leadership vote for over a week, even as some Republicans have said they would not support Johnson for the role.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-endorses-johnson-to-stay-on-as-house-speaker-after-government-funding-turmoil/7918609.html	2024-12-30T08:13:39-08:00	
Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts	Nairobi — In 2024, protests by young Kenyans sent shock waves through the country’s political scene, forcing the government to drop proposed taxes and fire several ministers. The youth movement highlighted the challenges Kenya faces as the government tries to increase revenues from citizens who are grappling with the high cost of living and are angry about corruption and what they see as attempts to stifle dissent. As the year comes to an end, President William Ruto’s government and a large section of Kenyan youth are still at odds over the direction the country is taking. The discontent erupted in June as parliament considered a bill that would increase taxes on certain food items and other sectors in the economy to help repay foreign loans and fund development programs. Lawmakers passed the bill, leading protesters storming the parliament buildings and burning a section of it. Ruto, seeing the public anger, declined to sign the bill into law. Nairobi has also witnessed protests against alleged police brutality. Rights groups say Kenyan security forces killed at least 65 people during protests or while in detention during 2024. On Monday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Nairobi to demand the release of Kenyans allegedly abducted from their homes and other places. According to human rights groups, at least 10 young critics of the government were kidnapped by unknown men in the last few weeks. The police have denied their officers were behind the abductions. Speaking in Homa Bay County on Friday, President Ruto said his government will end the mistreatment of youth. He called on parents to discipline their children. 'These children are blessings that are given to us. Every parent should take care of their children, let's work for our children. We, the government, will do our part, and we will end the abductions so that the Kenyan youth can live in peace,' he said. Boniface Mwangi is a Kenyan activist. He says Kenyan youths are united against the political elite who have made life difficult for them. 'The Gen Z movement, they came together, they were united and they had one goal to reject the finance bill which succeeded and they went a set further to demand for political reforms and change of cabinet and some of it happened and that forced the political elite to come together. So for the first time you have Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga and Ruto in the same camp,' he said. Since the protests, President Ruto has formed what he calls a broad-based government. He appointed some politicians allied with former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his 2022 election main challenger, Raila Odinga, to the office. 'We started as divided people and are closing the year with a broad-based government. We have brought many Kenyans together,' said Ruto. Political observers say this move is designed to better manage the opposition to his administration. Martin Andati, a political analyst, says such political maneuvers will do little to ease the public's anger toward the Ruto administration. 'The guys in power behave like nothing happened, but the truth is that the dynamics have completely shifted,' he said. 'The old political class, inclusive of President William Ruto, Raila Odinga, and the likes of Kalonzo, are still stuck in a time up; they are still thinking along tribal chieftains and political kingpins; they are going back to 2007 when these youths are in 2027 already.' Political observers predict a tough political fight ahead, as the Kenyan government and political parties have to constitute a new electoral commission. The current one technically exists, but all the commissioners’ terms have expired. Some are concerned that youthful activists will start petitions to recall members of parliament, a move that, if successful, may lead to the fall of the government and an early election before 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-grapples-with-protests-despite-political-unity-efforts-/7918553.html	2024-12-30T07:58:21-08:00

Gun owners eager to see firearms restrictions scrapped under Trump	U.S. gun violence prevention measures have been strengthened under the Biden Administration, but big policy changes are expected once President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.

German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election	Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor in protest. 'Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense,' government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements. She did, however, say that 'it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement.' In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country's stagnant economy. Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. He went on to say the far-right party 'can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality.' The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party. An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image. 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk's commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper's own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk's social media platform, X. 'I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print,' Eva Marie Kogel wrote. The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform. Musk's opinion piece in the Welt am Sonntag was accompanied by a critical article by the future editor-in-chief of the Welt group, Jan Philipp Burgard, who wrote that while some of Musk's diagnoses of Germany's problems may be correct 'his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-government-seeks-to-downplay-musk-s-backing-of-far-right-party-ahead-of-general-election-/7918445.html	2024-12-30T06:29:47-08:00	
Politician among protesters arrested in Kenya while calling for end to alleged abductions	Nairobi — An opposition politician and several other protesters were arrested in Kenya on Monday during street demonstrations calling for an end to alleged abductions, that recently targeted young government critics. Senator Okiya Omtatah had joined hundreds of protesters who sat down on the streets of the capital, Nairobi while chanting that police should free seven people abducted this month. Police hurled tear gas canisters at the protesters and when Omtatah and several others did not disperse and held on to a long chain, they were arrested. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Thursday raised concern over a growing number of alleged kidnappings of government critics, saying that the total number of such cases stands at 82 since the anti-government protests in June. President William Ruto on Saturday said the government would stop the abductions so that young people live in peace. Rights groups allege the country's police force is behind such kidnappings, but police have denied involvement and have said that they are investigating the disappearances. Senator Omtatah on Monday filed a case at the High Court in Nairobi seeking to compel the government to free seven youths, accusing the police of abducting them. 'If they have committed a crime, let them be prosecuted and presented in court to defend themselves,' he said. Young protesters said they were in solidarity with those abducted while going about their daily lives. 'We are existing at a time where we have to live in fear,' a protester, Orpah Thabiti said. Four social media users went missing after they shared AI-generated images of President Ruto that were deemed offensive by government supporters. The rights commission had warned that Kenya was heading back to the 'dark days' of the disappearance of government critics. The abduction and torture of the opposition were common under the administration of the late President Daniel Moi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/politician-among-protesters-arrested-in-kenya-while-calling-for-an-end-to-alleged-abductions-/7918432.html	2024-12-30T06:12:15-08:00	
China unveils new assault ship and futuristic fighter jets	Taipei, Taiwan — Days after unveiling the latest breakthroughs in its military modernization, the Chinese navy has set afloat a new amphibious assault ship that could launch fighter jets, and videos have been circulating online showing what seems to be China's new generation of stealth fighter jets. On Sunday, China's first Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, left the dockyard in Shanghai after the People's Liberation Army Navy, or PLA Navy, launched it into the water at a ceremony last Friday. The ship, which has a full load displacement of more than 40,000 tons, features a double island superstructure, a full-length flight deck, and an electromagnetic catapult system, which allows it to launch fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. In addition to the catapult system, the Sichuan has arresting technology that allows fighter jets to land on its deck. With its large displacement, the vessel 'can carry more weapons and equipment, has longer range and stronger combat capabilities,' Chinese military expert Zhang Junshe told Chinese state-run Global Times. Zhang added that the Sichuan 'has outstanding capabilities in air superiority and land assault missions' because the electromagnetic catapult system offers higher launch efficiency and faster launch speed. The PLA Navy said the Sichuan is a 'key asset' for enhancing the Chinese Navy's long-range operational capabilities and facilitating its ongoing transformation. Other analysts say Beijing wants to project military power 'beyond its shores' through the launch of the Sichuan. The launch is intended 'to intimidate neighbors or ensure the PLA has the capability to land a large invasion force on Taiwan,' Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official, said in a written response to VOA. In combat scenarios, experts say the Sichuan could be paired up with China's aircraft carrier groups. 'The Chinese military could use the Sichuan to deploy drones during the first wave of attack and then deploy larger fighter jets from its aircraft carriers later,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping said the Sichuan could be used in the South China Sea, East China Sea, or a potential military conflict against Taiwan. 'If [China] takes military actions against Taiwan, [Beijing] will use whatever weapons it possesses, including the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 076 amphibious assault ship,' he told VOA. Since its establishment in 1949, the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring Taiwan under its control, even by force. The launch of the Sichuan reflects China's ongoing efforts to rapidly expand the number of its naval vessels in recent years. 'The Chinese have been producing ships at an unprecedented rate and you can't say the same of the United States' shipbuilding rate,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. In terms of numbers, the PLA navy has a bigger fleet than the U.S. Navy, and its capabilities are confined in one theater, he adds. 'A growing PLA Navy that is operationally more focused on the theater is likely going to have a certain advantage over the U.S. Navy that is still considered having to bear with various global responsibilities other than this part of the world,' Koh told VOA by phone. A new generation of fighter jets In addition to the launch of the new amphibious assault ship, several videos and images of two seemingly new Chinese stealth fighter jets flying in broad daylight were circulating online last Friday. The images and videos of the two fighter jets posted online have a triangular, tailless design typical to stealth fighter jets. The larger fighter jet, accompanied by China's J-20 stealth fighter jet, seems to have three air intakes for its engines, while the smaller fighter jet bears a more conventional layout. The Chinese government has yet to comment on the unnamed fighter jets featured in the videos, but analysts say their advanced designs show China is rapidly catching up with the U.S. and its Western allies. 'Apart from trying to become a sea power, these seemingly new fighter jets show China also wants to eventually replace the U.S. as the leading air power in the world,' Su in Taiwan told VOA. In his view, because the U.S. and its Western allies still control access to advanced semiconductor chips used in next-generation fighter jets, Washington needs to maintain strict export control of advanced semiconductor ships to China to stay ahead of the curve in the military aircraft arms race. 'Imposing strict export control on advanced semiconductor ships will become the key geopolitical chokepoint that Washington can leverage against Beijing in the global arms race,' Su said. VOA's Nike Ching and VOA Mandarin service reporter Lin Nai-chuan contributed to this story.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-new-assault-ship-and-futuristic-fighter-jets-/7918360.html	2024-12-30T05:58:31-08:00	
Iran confirms arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala	Dubai — Iran confirmed the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday. Sala, 29, who works for the newspaper Il Foglio and the podcast company Chora Media, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, according to the Italian foreign ministry. Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani on Saturday declined to say whether the case might be linked to the arrest of an Iranian in Italy this month at the request of the United States. The case of the Italian journalist being held in Iran is 'complicated,' but Rome hopes to bring Sala home quickly, Tajani said. 'Italian national Cecilia Sala traveled to Iran on Dec. 13 with a journalist visa and was detained on Dec. 19... for violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' a statement by Iran's Culture Ministry said, according to IRNA. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on Dec. 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on Dec. 20. Sala has been in contact by phone with her family and the Italian embassy in Tehran was notified of her detention, the statement said. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies taking prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-confirms-arrest-of-italian-journalist-cecilia-sala-/7918304.html	2024-12-30T04:44:53-08:00	
WHO chief calls for end to attacks on Gaza hospitals	World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday the health system in the Gaza Strip is 'under severe threat' as he called for an end to Israeli attacks on hospitals. 'People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need access to provide health aid. Ceasefire!' Tedros said in a statement. Tedros also called for the immediate release of Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, who was detained by Israeli forces along with more than 200 Palestinians last week. At the time, the Israeli military said the hospital was being used by militants and that Safiya was being questioned as a suspected Hamas member. The hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, was one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. 'Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is out of service — following the raid, forced patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya two days ago. His whereabouts are unknown,' Tedros said. The WHO chief also said the agency’s partners were able to carry out deliveries of medical supplies, food and water to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began with the October 2023 attack on southern Israel, during which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 people and injured 108,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Taliban say they will close all NGOs employing Afghan women	The Taliban say they will close all national and foreign nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan employing women. It comes two years after they told NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, allegedly because they didn’t wear the Islamic headscarf correctly. In a letter published on X Sunday night, the Economy Ministry warned that failure to comply with the latest order would lead to NGOs losing their license to operate in Afghanistan. The ministry said it was responsible for the registration, coordination, leadership and supervision of all activities carried out by national and foreign organizations. The government was once again ordering the stoppage of all female work in institutions not controlled by the Taliban, according to the letter. 'In case of lack of cooperation, all activities of that institution will be canceled and the activity license of that institution, granted by the ministry, will also be canceled.' It’s the Taliban’s latest attempt to control or intervene in NGO activity. Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council heard that an increasing proportion of female Afghan humanitarian workers were prevented from doing their work even though relief work remains essential. According to Tom Fletcher, a senior U.N. official, the proportion of humanitarian organizations reporting that their female or male staff were stopped by the Taliban’s morality police has also increased. The Taliban deny they are stopping aid agencies from carrying out their work or interfering with their activities. They have already barred women from many jobs and most public spaces, and also excluded them from education beyond sixth grade. In another development, the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has ordered that buildings should not have windows looking into places where a woman might sit or stand. According to a four-clause decree posted on X late Saturday, the order applies to new buildings as well as existing ones. Windows should not overlook or look into areas like yards or kitchens. Where a window looks into such a space then the person responsible for that property must find a way to obscure this view to 'remove harm,' by installing a wall, fence or screen. Municipalities and other authorities must supervise the construction of new buildings to avoid installing windows that look into or over residential properties, the decree added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing was not immediately available for comment on Akhundzada’s instructions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-say-they-will-close-all-ngos-employing-afghan-women/7918279.html	2024-12-30T03:46:07-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 21 of 43 Russian drones	Ukraine's military said Monday it shot down 21 drones that Russian forces used in attacks overnight targeting multiple areas across northern and eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched a total of 43 drones, and that its air defenses shot down drones over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Poltava regions. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged five residential buildings but did not hurt anyone. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported a building fire caused by a drone attack, as well as a drone hit near a highway. He added there were no casualties in his region. Russia's defense ministry said Monday it intercepted a drone over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Regional officials in Kursk also said Russian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian missile early Monday.

Linda Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom 'Alice,' dies at 87	NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom 'Alice,' has died. She was 87. Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. The title was shortened to 'Alice' and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song 'There's a New Girl in Town,' ran from 1976 to 1985. The show turned 'Kiss my grits' into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner. The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into 'All in the Family' on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's 'Broadway Bound' in 1987. She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, 'No Good Deed,' and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, 'Mid-Century Modern,' according to Deadline, which first reported her death. Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical 'It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman.' She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, 'Broadway Bound.' In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on 'Barney Miller' and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn's Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.' Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy 'The New Century,' had a concert show called 'Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress' and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' 'Collected Stories.' Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in 'Collected Stories,' writing that she 'gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.' Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's 'The Lyons.' She also starred in 'Other Desert Cities' and a revival of 'Follies' before they transferred to Broadway. The AP again raved about Lavin in 'The Lyons,' calling her 'an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length.' She also appeared in the film 'Wanderlust' with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, 'Possibilities.' She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in 'The Back-Up Plan.' When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. 'I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,' she told the AP in 2011. She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. It opened in 2007 and their productions include 'Doubt' by John Patrick Shanley, 'Glengarry Glen Ross' by David Mamet, 'Rabbit Hole' by David Lindsay-Abaire and 'The Tale of the Allergist's Wife' by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. She returned to TV in 2013 in 'Sean Saves the World,' starring 'Will & Grace's' Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on 'Mom' and '9JKL.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/linda-lavin-tony-winning-broadway-actress-who-starred-in-sitcom-alice-dies-at-87-/7918230.html	2024-12-30T01:39:28-08:00	
Sports teams honor late former US President Jimmy Carter	Sports teams in former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's home state of Georgia expressed their condolences Sunday, honoring a former leader who also served as the state's governor and had an extensive record as an athlete and sports fan. The Atlanta Falcons football team held a moment of silence before their game Sunday night. The team's owner, Arthur Blank, called Carter 'a great American, a proud Georgian and an inspirational global humanitarian.' The Atlanta Hawks basketball team said Carter 'represented all the best of Georgia.' 'From his rural upbringing that he never strayed from, to his passion for Atlanta sports, Carter was proud of his home state and left a legacy for Georgians to be proud of, too,' the team said in a statement. Carter was most known for being a fan of the Atlanta Braves baseball team, whose games he and his wife, Rosalynn, attended for decades. The team celebrated his 100th birthday in October, and on Sunday it said Carter 'served both his country and home state with honor his entire life.' 'While the world knew him as a remarkable humanitarian and peacemaker, we knew him as a dedicated Braves fan and we will miss having him in the stands cheering on his Braves,' the team said in a statement. Carter was in attendance in 1974 when Braves player Hank Aaron set the Major League Baseball record for most career home runs. In 1995, Carter threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the sixth game of the World Series, which the Braves won to capture their first championship since moving to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966. As an athlete himself, Carter was fond of playing softball, including during his time as president. While in the White House, Carter was also part of a boom in running in the United States that saw recreational running rapidly expand during the 1970s. His competitive running career included time on the U.S. Naval Academy cross-country team. Carter also enjoyed playing tennis and watching car racing, and he participated in the presidential tradition of welcoming championship sports teams to the White House.

South Korea mourns as investigators probe cause of deadly plane crash	South Korea was in mourning Monday as investigators worked to determine the cause of a plane crash in Muan that killed 179 of the 181 people on board. Acting President Choi Sang-mok appeared Monday at a memorial in Muan, about 290 kilometers south of Seoul, where he laid a flower and bowed in respect to the victims. A senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport told reporters that officials planned to conduct a special investigation of all the Boeing 737-800 planes operating in the country. The crashed plane's flight data recorder will be sent to a facility in Seoul later this week for analysis, officials said, with personnel from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board taking part in the probe. Some passengers still unidentified Sunday's crash in which the plane skidded off the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames was one of South Korea's deadliest aviation disasters. As of early Monday, authorities were still trying to identify some of the victims. Two people, both crew members, were pulled out of the wreckage alive. 'Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of [it] looks almost impossible to recognize,' Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told reporters as he described what was left of the plane. Lee added that investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the incident. President Joe Biden said the United States was ready to offer any assistance needed in the wake of the disaster. 'As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by this tragedy. The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance,' Biden said in a statement released by the White House. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement released Sunday, 'The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the news of a plane crash in Muan county in the Republic of Korea, which has claimed the lives of 179 people. 'He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and Government of the Republic of Korea during this difficult time,' the statement said. Boeing 'ready to support' Sunday's crash was the worst aviation disaster involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet went down in Guam, killing more than 200 people. Jeju Air issued an apology following the crash and promised to do its 'utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.' Boeing said it was in touch with Jeju Air and was 'ready to support them.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,' the company said in a statement. Transport ministry officials said two Thai nationals were on board and the rest were believed to be South Koreans. Officials in Thailand reported no issues with the plane when it left Bangkok.

Stock market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech giants	Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company's jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on December 3 amounted to rebellion. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the 'Magnificent 7,' which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global trade.

Authorities find bodies of 15 men in clandestine graves in Mexico	TAPACHULA, MEXICO — Eleven clandestine graves with the bodies of 15 men were located in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, where a dispute between the Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generacion drug cartels is taking place, local authorities said Sunday. Chiapas Governor Eduardo Ramirez Aguilar said on his social media channels that the findings came as the result of a raid in the city of La Concordia, near Mexico's border with Guatemala. He said four people connected to the case had been arrested with weapons and drugs. The state prosecutor's office said in a statement that the raid took place in two different properties. The first site had three bodies in three graves and in the second, eight graves with 12 bodies. 'It is worth mentioning that for these operations technological tools such as drones and geo-radars were used, in addition to aerial overflight, ground search, field forensics, back-excavation and drills,' it said. Chiapas Prosecutor General Jorge Luis Llaven Abarca said last week that another clandestine grave with charred bodies was found in Emiliano Zapata, neighboring La Concordia, but did not give more details because of the poor state of the bodies for identification. The dispute over drug routes, migrant trafficking and weapons has left more than 10,000 people displaced in recent years, including Mexicans fleeing to Guatemala, according to reports from humanitarian organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-find-bodies-of-15-men-in-clandestine-graves-in-mexico-/7918175.html	2024-12-29T22:21:26-08:00	
Storm system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths	Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning tornadoes and killing at least four people. There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. 'It's not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,' said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the city on Saturday. At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30 meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged. In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith said. In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said 'it was just a freak accident' and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 'It's very sad, just terrible timing,' Maffucci said, adding that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and 'quite a few wrecks.' Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville. Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said of the storm. 'I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities.' As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had about 10,000 customers without power, it said. The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the organization's supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about 152 millimeters of rain fell. He's spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene. The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene, Fromkin said, and Sunday's downpour adds to the problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-system-spawns-tornadoes-across-us-leading-to-4-deaths-/7918166.html	2024-12-29T21:41:42-08:00	
Netanyahu 'in good condition' after prostate surgery, says hospital	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully underwent prostate removal surgery on Sunday and is in good condition, according to the hospital treating him. The surgery took place while Israel remains at war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, more than 14 months after an unprecedented attack by Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7 last year. 'The prime minister has awakened from anesthesia and is in good condition. He has been transferred to the recovery unit and will remain under observation in the coming days,' the Hadassah Medical Centre said in a statement. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement. Earlier, in March, Netanyahu underwent a hernia surgery, and in July last year, doctors implanted a pacemaker after a medical scare.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-in-good-condition-after-prostate-surgery-says-hospital/7918162.html	2024-12-29T20:56:53-08:00	
Waves pound coasts of Ecuador and Peru, closing ports, killing 2	LIMA, PERU — Big waves of up to four meters are pummeling the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, leaving scores of ports closed and at least two people dead, authorities said Sunday. Ecuador's secretary for risk management, Jorge Carillo, told a media conference that an 'extreme event' was occurring and warned that similar phenomena could be expected in the future. He said that 'unfortunately, we have two deaths, both recorded' in Ecuador's southwestern Manta region. In neighboring Peru, almost all ports were closed because of the constant battering of waves, the head of the naval Oceanographic Department, Enrique Varea, told the broadcaster Canal N. He forecast that the big waves 'will continue in coming days,' but expected them to calm somewhat from Monday, and to return more to normal in the first days of January. Climate change 'is behind these sorts of anomalous waves,' the head of the Civil Defense unit in Peru's Callao region, Larry Linch, told AFP. Images shown on local media showed jetties and public squares submerged in some parts of Peru, sending residents fleeing to higher ground. The waves, according to the Peruvian navy, are being generated off the U.S. coast by winds along the ocean's surface. Many beaches along the central and northern stretches of the country were closed to prevent risk to human life, authorities said. Many fishing boats were damaged, while those that were spared were still unable to work in the dangerous conditions. 'We need help from authorities. Here, we've lost some 100 boats,' one fisherman told TV Peru. 'I'm 70 years old and I've never seen such unusual and strong waves,' he said. Thirty-one fishermen stranded in the swell were rescued Saturday afternoon by the navy, while one told local radio that around 180 more remained at sea. Big waves were also seen crashing into the central Chilean coast in Vina del Mar, sparking warnings from authorities. Callao, which sits adjacent to the capital Lima and is home to Peru's largest port, has closed several beaches and barred tourist and fishing boats from venturing out. 'There is a major problem,' La Cruz district mayor Roberto Carrillo Zavala told AFP after surveying damage via helicopter with Peru's Minister of Defense Walter Astudillo Chavez. 'The most affected have been the fishermen,' Zavala said. 'We hope nothing more happens, as this would significantly impact the economy.' The phenomenon began on Christmas and will last until January 1, according to Peru's National Emergency Operations Center.	https://www.voanews.com/a/waves-pound-coasts-of-ecuador-and-peru-closing-ports-killing-2-/7918145.html	2024-12-29T20:22:23-08:00	
South Korea joint investigation unit requests arrest warrant for Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's joint investigation unit has requested an arrest warrant for suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this month, an official said on Monday. Yoon has failed to respond to multiple summons for questioning by police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials who are jointly investigating whether his December 3 martial-law declaration amounted to insurrection. A court will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant following the request. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for the suspended president, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Yoon was suspended from presidential powers after being impeached by parliament earlier this month over his decision to briefly impose martial law. A Constitutional Court trial is ongoing into whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. On December 27, the court held its first preparatory hearing where a request by Yoon's lawyers for a postponement in proceedings to better prepare was denied. The court said it would move swiftly. The next hearing is due on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-joint-investigation-unit-requests-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-over-martial-law-/7918130.html	2024-12-29T18:48:07-08:00	
Finland finds drag marks on Baltic seabed after cable damage	OSLO, NORWAY — Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometers along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor. The Cook Islands-registered Eagle S was boarded by Finnish police and coast guard officials on Thursday and sailed into Finnish waters where the crew of the impounded tanker is being questioned. Baltic Sea nations have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said on Friday it would boost its presence in the region. A break in the 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia occurred at midday on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking the two countries, grid operators said. They said Estlink 2 might not be back in service before August. Finnish police suspect the Eagle S caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Investigators have identified a 'dragging track' but have yet to find a missing anchor, Sami Paila, tactical leader and detective chief inspector of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, said in a statement. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length,' Paila said. Photos taken of the Eagle S on Friday showed the vessel missing its port side anchor. Finland's customs service believes the ship is part of a 'shadow fleet' of aging tankers being used to evade sanctions on exports of Russian oil. The Kremlin said on Friday that Finland's seizure of the ship was of little concern to it. Russia has denied involvement in any of the previous Baltic infrastructure damage incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-finds-drag-marks-on-baltic-seabed-after-cable-damage-/7918122.html	2024-12-29T17:55:08-08:00	
Ethiopia traffic accident kills dozens	Dozens of people were killed Sunday in Ethiopia in a traffic accident in Sidama region.

Ashenafi Bliso, director of Bona Hospital, confirmed the death toll with VOA in a phone interview. He said four people were seriously injured and are being treated at the hospital. He added that one victim was transferred to Hawassa Referral Hospital for advanced treatment. Mate said a truck carrying passengers lost control while passing over a bridge and plunged into the Galana River. Mate said the victims include young people from the same area who were returning from a wedding ceremony and work at a coffee site.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-traffic-accident-kills-dozens/7918105.html	2024-12-29T16:40:52-08:00	
World leaders react to former US President Jimmy Carter's death	World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at age 100. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden 'Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian. Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump 'The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.' President Barack Obama 'Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did – advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection – things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. ... Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away – buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.' President George W. Bush 'Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family. James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.' Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 'From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity -- he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.' French President Emmanuel Macron 'Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace. France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American people.' Vice President Kamala Harris 'Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center. I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.' Vice President-elect JD Vance 'Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in Peace.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 'Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants, President Jimmy Carter. President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity. From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 'I was very sorry to hear of President Carter's passing and I would like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service. His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize. Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights at home and abroad.' US Senator Mitch McConnell 'Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. 'President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most.' US House Speaker Mike Johnson 'Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.' US Representative Mike Turner 'I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family.' US Senator Mark Warner 'President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home.' US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin 'Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-leaders-react-to-former-us-president-jimmy-carter-s-death/7918097.html	2024-12-29T16:24:58-08:00

Key moments in the life of Jimmy Carter	Jimmy Carter's 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see him as weak — and send him packing after only one term. Carter's legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency, the longest in U.S. history. Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100. The Panama Canal During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of the 20th century. 'Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world,' he said at the signing of the canal treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977. Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999. History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of diplomacy. Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal's management in the run-up to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America's image as an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America. Morality in politics Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his agenda. 'Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice, political self-determination and basic human rights,' he said in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy. In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate. Camp David Accords In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington. After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter's mediation, two accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following year. The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Crisis of confidence In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a nationwide televised speech on July 15. In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of leadership, instead laying the blame on a national 'crisis of confidence.' 'The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America,' he said. The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five cabinet members resigned that week. Iran hostage crisis The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the death knell for Carter's presidency. A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished his chances of reelection later that year. Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight servicemen. In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned, and the mission's failure symbolized Carter's inability to resolve the crisis. The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in November 1980. The Carter Center Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement from political life. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting disease. Carter — often viewed as America's most successful former president — traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor, and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator. The Elders Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human rights. Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-moments-in-the-life-of-jimmy-carter/7917840.html	2024-12-29T15:02:21-08:00

Israeli hospital says Netanyahu has undergone successful prostate surgery	Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful surgery Sunday to have his prostate removed, hospital officials said, a procedure that came as he manages multiple crises including the war in Gaza and his trial for alleged corruption. Netanyahu, who has had a series of health issues in recent years, has gone to great lengths to bolster a public image of himself as a healthy, energetic leader. During his trial this month, he boasted about working 18-hour days, accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could take a toll on his well-being. Netanyahu, 75, is among older world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, President-elect Donald Trump, 78, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 79, and Pope Francis, 88, who have come under scrutiny for their age and health issues. Netanyahu's latest condition is common in older men, but the procedure has had some fallout. The judges overseeing his trial accepted a request Sunday from his lawyer to call off three days of testimony scheduled this week. The lawyer, Amit Hadad, had argued that Netanyahu would be fully sedated for the procedure and hospitalized for 'a number of days.' Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center announced late Sunday that the procedure had been 'completed successfully.' Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close ally, served as acting prime minister during the operation. Netanyahu is expected to remain hospitalized for several days. With so much at stake, Netanyahu’s health in wartime is a concern for both Israelis and the wider world. A turbulent time in the region As Israel’s leader, Netanyahu is at the center of major global events that are shifting the Middle East. With the dizzying pace of the past 14 months, being incapacitated for even a few hours can be risky. Netanyahu will be in the hospital at a time when international mediators are pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and as fighting between Israel and Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels intensifies. Prostate issues are common and, in many cases, easily treatable. Still, the procedure puts a dent in Netanyahu’s image of vigor at a time when he would want to project strength more than ever, both to an Israeli audience navigating constant threats as well as to Israel’s enemies looking to expose its weaknesses. Previous health issues, include a heart condition Netanyahu insists he is in excellent health. His office releases footage of him touring war zones in full protective gear flanked by military officers, or meeting with defense officials on windswept hilltops in youthful dark shades and puffer jackets. But that image was shattered last year when Netanyahu’s doctors revealed that he had a heart condition, a problem that he had apparently long known about but concealed from the public. A week after a fainting spell, Netanyahu was fitted with a pacemaker to control his heartbeat. Only then did staff at the Sheba Medical Center reveal that Netanyahu has for years experienced a condition that can cause irregular heartbeats. The revelation came as Netanyahu was dealing with massive anti-government protests. The news about a chronic heart problem stoked further anger and distrust during extreme political polarization in Israel. Last year, Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital for what doctors said likely was dehydration. He stayed overnight, prompting his weekly Cabinet meeting to be delayed. Earlier this year, Netanyahu underwent hernia surgery, during which he was under full anesthesia and unconscious. Levin served as acting prime minister during the operation. Recovery can be quick According to Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli leader was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection Wednesday stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate. The infection was treated successfully with antibiotics, but doctors said the surgery was needed in any case. Complications from prostate enlargement are common in men in their 70s and 80s, Dr. Shay Golan, head of the oncology urology service at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, told Israeli Army Radio. Golan spoke in general terms and was not involved in Netanyahu’s care or treatment. He said an enlarged prostate can block proper emptying of the bladder, leading to a build-up of urine that can lead to an infection or other complications. After medicinal treatment, doctors can recommend a procedure to remove the prostate to prevent future blockages, Golan said. In Netanyahu’s case, because the prostate is not cancerous, Golan said doctors were likely performing an endoscopic surgery, carried out by inserting small instruments into a body cavity, rather than making surgical cuts in the abdomen to reach the prostate. The procedure lasts about an hour, Golan said, and recovery is quick. He said that aside from catheter use for one to three days after the procedure, patients can return to normal activity without significant limitations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-hospital-says-netanyahu-has-undergone-successful-prostate-surgery/7917792.html	2024-12-29T13:40:36-08:00	
In Photos: A look back at the life of President Jimmy Carter	Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100. Since leaving the White House, Carter has logged millions of miles and visited dozens of countries on missions to wipe out diseases, mediate conflicts, advocate for human rights and monitor elections. He's built a legacy that few, if any, American ex-presidents can match.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-photos-legacy-of-jimmy-carter-39th-president-of-united-states/6974239.html	2024-12-29T13:31:53-08:00	
Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100	Atlanta, Georgia — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100. When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage, 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force, were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-dies-at-100/7917788.html	2024-12-29T13:26:32-08:00	
Syria's de facto leader: Holding elections may take up to 4 years	Cairo — Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in an interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. The comment from Sharaa, who leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, comes as the new government in Damascus has been seeking to reassure its neighbors that it has moved away from its roots in Islamist militancy. The group's lightning campaign ended a 13-year civil war but has left a host of questions about the future of a multi-ethnic country where foreign states including Turkey and Russia have strong and potentially competing interests. While Western powers largely welcomed the end of the Assad family rule in Syria, it remains unclear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move towards democracy. Sharaa said HTS, formerly known as the Nusra Front, would be dissolved at a national dialog conference. When asked about dissolving the group, Sharaa said: 'Of course. A country cannot be run by the mentality of groups and militias.' The group was once affiliated with Islamic State and al-Qaida but has since renounced both and sought to reposition itself as a force for moderation. It has repeatedly vowed to protect minority groups, who fear the new rulers could seek to impose an Islamist government and has warned of attempts to incite sectarian strife. According to Sharaa, the national dialog conference would include wide participation by Syrian society with votes on issues such as dissolving the parliament and the constitution. On the situation in northeastern Syria, Sharaa said there are talks with all parties to resolve remaining disputes including with the U.S.-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 'We reject Syria becoming a platform for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to launch attacks against Turkey,' he said. He said arms should only be under the control of the state, adding that the ministry of defense would welcome those capable of joining the army. In the interview, Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close Assad ally during the long civil war which has military bases in the country, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. Sharaa said this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the status of Russia's military bases would be the subject of negotiations with the new leadership in Damascus. 'It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds, but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision, and interaction with the local side,' he said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA published Sunday. Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head. In response to a question about neighboring states' concerns over Islamist groups, he said: 'We will not work on exporting the revolution. We want to manage the phase with the mentality of the state and not revolution,' he said, reiterating that they are keen on establishing strategic relations with all regional states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-de-facto-leader-holding-elections-may-take-up-to-4-years/7917780.html	2024-12-29T13:17:26-08:00	
Flights temporarily halted at Halifax airport after airplane landing incident	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is investigating an incident involving a plane at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport, which one passenger described as a rough landing that sparked flames. Nikki Valentine, who was on the PAL Airlines flight, said passengers felt a 'massive rumble' upon landing Saturday night. 'The cabin tilted, we saw sparks and then flames and then smoke started getting sucked into the cabin,' Valentine said Sunday. Airport spokesperson Tiffany Chase said an Air Canada Express flight operated by PAL Airlines, arriving from St. John’s, Newfoundland, experienced an incident upon landing at approximately 9:30 p.m. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the Bombardier Q400 plane experienced a 'suspected landing gear issue' after arrival and was unable to reach the terminal. Fitzpatrick said the crew and 73 passengers were off-loaded by bus and nobody on board was injured. Valentine said she is 'especially thankful the pilot was able to get ahold of the situation very fast.' The incident temporarily halted flight activity at the airport. As of Sunday afternoon, Valentine and other passengers were still without the bags they were instructed to leave on the plane. Valentine said she contacted Air Canada, who told her that it could be up to three more days before their bags are returned as the investigation into the incident continues. 'A lot of people have things like house keys or wallets they needed and couldn’t get,' she said. 'It’s all proper procedure, and I’d rather the inconvenience (of missing bags) than if anything bad had happened, of course, but it’s still tough.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/flights-temporarily-halted-at-halifax-airport-after-airplane-landing-incident-/7917781.html	2024-12-29T13:13:52-08:00

Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' battle for No. 1 at holiday box office	Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' winning the three-day weekend over 'Mufasa' by a blue hair. Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while 'Mufasa' brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s 'Mufasa' had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million. It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of 'Wicked' and 'Moana 2,' which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively. The vampire horror 'Nosferatu' also debuted triumphantly. Robert Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama 'Babygirl' with Nicole Kidman; and 'The Fire Inside,' about boxer Claressa Shields. 'Nosferatu' landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting 'The Faculty's' $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. It was a gamble to open 'Nosferatu' on Christmas, when family films or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off, attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters. 'It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,' said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. 'A lot of people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to do.' The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying. The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over $100. 'People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake it up,' Bunnell said. 'You don’t just spoon feed them the same things over and over again.' The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race. 'Babygirl,' an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival. 'The Fire Inside,' from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in 2006 theaters. Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to 'Wicked,' which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits. 'Moana 2' rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically. Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million. 'Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the holidays lined up,' said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst. Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75 billion in domestic box office receipts. That's down about 3.3% from last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11 billion. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, are: 1. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $38 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $37.1 million. 3. 'Nosferatu,' $21.2 million. 4. 'Wicked,' $19.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $18.2 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $11.6 million. 7. 'Babygirl,' $4.4 million. 8. 'Gladiator II,' $4.2 million. 9. 'Homestead,' $3.2 million. 10. 'The Fire Inside,' $2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sonic-3-and-mufasa-battle-for-no-1-at-holiday-box-office/7917744.html	2024-12-29T11:20:20-08:00	
Tourist killed in shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort	Cairo — One tourist was killed and another was injured in a shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort, the environment ministry said in a statement on Sunday without giving the nationalities of those involved. There are sharks in the Red Sea but encounters with them are relatively rare. The ministry said the attack occurred in deep water outside the designated swimming zone near the jetties in northern Marsa Alam, adding that swimming out from the jetties was prohibited and the jetties would be closed for two days from Monday. Marsa Alam is an Egyptian coastal town known for its coral reefs, marine life and beaches. The last similar incident was in June 2023 when a tiger shark killed a Russian national in Hurghada, another coastal city on the Red Sea north of Marsa Alam. Last month a tourist boat capsized in the same area, leaving four dead and seven missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tourist-killed-in-shark-attack-in-egypt-s-marsa-alam-resort-/7917705.html	2024-12-29T10:19:32-08:00	
Croatia holds presidential election with incumbent NATO, EU critic favored	ZAGREB — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection in the Adriatic Sea state, but is unlikely to get an outright majority in the first round of voting Sunday. President Zoran Milanović, who is often compared to Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents, faces seven other contenders, including Dragan Primorac, the candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. The two are expected to face off in the second round on Jan. 12 if no contender gets more than 50% of the vote, according to pre-election polls. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia’s political scene. 'Since the election silence is still on, I just want to call on people to get out and vote. To support me,' Milanović said after he voted Sunday. He predicted there would be a second round in two weeks. Plenković, the prime minister, has sought to portray the vote as one about Croatia’s future in the EU and NATO. He has labeled Milanović 'pro-Russian' and a threat to Croatia’s international standing. 'The difference between him and Milanović is quite simple: Milanović is leading us East, Primorac is leading us West,' he said. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the NATO and European Union support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, though it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanović has also blocked Croatia’s participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'no Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia’s place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. During the election campaign, Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanović as divisive. 'Today is an extremely important day,' Primorac said after casting his ballot. 'Croatia is going forward into the future. Croatia needs unity, Croatia needs its global positioning, and above all Croatia needs peaceful life.' Trailing a distant third in the pre-election polls is Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate. She has focused her election campaign on the economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Sunday’s presidential election is Croatia’s third vote this year, following a snap parliamentary election in April and the European Parliament balloting in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-holds-presidential-election-with-incumbent-nato-eu-critic-favored-/7917676.html	2024-12-29T09:50:57-08:00	
Will New Year's Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?	New york — If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone. A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 'As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?' says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa. Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found. But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way — by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025. There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024. Relaxed New Year's Eve plans for many Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key. 'A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t found anything or things are just really expensive,' she said. 'Party packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.' As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above — say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all. Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland. 'I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is definitely a change,' he said. 'I wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.' Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues. 'Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,' she said. 'I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.' Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025. Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. 'It’s probably a good year to focus on mental health,' he said. Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health. Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: 'Probably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.' Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. 'Mental health is the new one, but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,' she said. She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: 'I don’t know if that’s really a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.' And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do. This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. 'Hockey’s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-new-year-s-eve-be-loud-or-quiet-what-are-the-top-2025-resolutions-ap-norc-poll-has-answers-/7917658.html	2024-12-29T09:14:47-08:00	
Syria's Jewish community can visit one of world's oldest synagogues again	JOBAR, Syria — In this Damascus suburb, the handful of remaining Jews in Syria can again make pilgrimages to one of the world’s oldest synagogues where people from throughout the region once came to pray. Syria’s 13-year civil war left the synagogue partially destroyed. Walls and roofs have collapsed. Some artifacts are missing. A marble sign in Arabic at the gate says it was first built 720 years before Christ. Since insurgents overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in early December, people have been able to safely visit the widely destroyed Jobar suburb that was pounded for years by government forces while in the hands of opposition fighters. Syria was once home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities. Those numbers have shrunk dramatically, especially after the state of Israel was created in 1948. Today, only nine Jews live in Syria, according to the head of the community, almost all older men and women. The community believes that no Syrian Jews will remain in the country in a few years. One of the people visiting the Jobar Synagogue, also known as Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue, on Thursday was gray-haired Bakhour Chamntoub, the head of the community in Syria. 'This synagogue means a lot to us,' the 74-year-old told The Associated Press during his first visit in 15 years. Chamntoub had heard the synagogue was damaged, but he did not expect to see that part of it had been reduced to a pile of debris. 'I am frankly disturbed,' he said. Chamntoub said Jewish people from around the world have been calling him to say they are ready to help rebuild. He had refused to leave Syria during the war, while all 12 of his siblings left. He said he was happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him. Chamntoub said he had been one of the few Jews who openly spoke about his faith, adding that he never faced discrimination. He said other Jews preferred not to speak openly for safety reasons amid the animosity in Syria toward archenemy Israel and fears of being labeled spies or collaborators. The Jewish community in Syria dates to the prophet Elijah’s Damascus sojourn nearly 3,000 years ago. After 1099, when Christian armies conquered Jerusalem in the First Crusade and massacred the city’s Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, some 50,000 Jews reportedly fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of residents. Another wave of Jews later arrived from Europe, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition that began in 1492. The community in Syria numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. In the years surrounding Israel's creation, Syrian Jews faced increased tensions and restrictions. Many emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries. Under the Assad family's 54-year dynasty, Jews in Syria enjoyed freedom in performing religious duties, but community members were prevented from traveling outside the country to prevent them from going to Israel until the early 1990s. Once travel restrictions were lifted after Arab-Israeli peace talks started, many more left. Before Syria’s conflict began in 2011, Chamntoub and other remaining community members came on Saturdays to Jobar for prayers. He recalled Torahs written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, tapestries and carpets. All are gone, likely stolen by looters. Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, recounted how worshipers on Saturdays asked him to turn on the lights or light a candle since Jews are not allowed to do physical labor on the Sabbath. 'It was a beautiful religious place,' Hazroumi said of the synagogue, which at some point during the war was protected by rebels. It and the whole destroyed suburb 'needs to be reconstructed from scratch.' Assad’s forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed tight security, preventing many people from reaching the area. The new rulers of Syria, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have said they will allow members of all religions to perform their religious duties freely. There have been some sectarian attacks but mostly against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. After visiting the synagogue, Chamntoub returned to his home in old Damascus, close to the private Jewish school known as Maimonides that was founded in 1944 but has been closed for decades. Posters in Hebrew remain on the walls. The area is known as the Jewish quarter. Many old homes have doors and windows closed with pieces of metal and a sign in Arabic saying: 'The real estate is closed by the state's Higher Committee for the Affairs of Jews.' As the Jewish community has shrunk, it has also struggled to find kosher food. Chamntoub receives packages of meat from siblings in the U.S. at least once a year via people traveling to Syria. In the past, he went to the chicken market with a Jewish friend who would slaughter them, but the man now can hardly walk. Chamntoub mostly eats vegetarian dishes. Almost every morning, he cooks for himself and a Jewish woman in the area with no remaining relatives in Syria. The woman, 88-year-old Firdos Mallakh, sat on a couch Thursday under two blankets. When asked to greet an AP journalist with 'Shabbat Shalom,' she replied it was not yet time. 'Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday,' she said. Chamntoub, who makes a living as a landlord, asked Mallakh why she had not turned on the gas heater. Mallakh said she did not want to waste gas. Chamntoub hopes that with the fall of Assad, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. In the past, he said, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without permission from the security agencies. 'I am a Jew, and I am proud of it,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917656.html	2024-12-29T09:01:01-08:00

3 die off northern France coast in Channel crossing attempt	Paris — At least three migrants died early Sunday while attempting to cross the English Channel to Britain from northern France, authorities said. The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy's 'Dauphin' helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. 'There were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,' he said during a press conference Sunday. Sunday's tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past days. 'Since Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,' said Billant. 'But crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.' This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. Billant blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. 'These are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,' he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/die-off-northern-france-coast-in-channel-crossing-attempt-/7917566.html	2024-12-29T07:00:18-08:00	
Tornadoes in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves east	Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and Mississippi. The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of Florida and elsewhere. On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. There were 'multiple touchdown points' in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage. There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the state. At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and 13,000, Texas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tornadoes-in-texas-mississippi-kill-2-and-injure-6-as-severe-weather-system-moves-east-/7917548.html	2024-12-29T06:36:28-08:00	
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Russia unintentionally	Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. [...] We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow's responsibility. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan has begun at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-s-president-says-crashed-jetliner-was-shot-down-by-russia-unintentionally-/7917504.html	2024-12-29T05:29:46-08:00	
Gaza captors tortured hostages, including minors, Israeli report says	JERUSALEM — Hostages held in Gaza were subjected to torture, including sexual and psychological abuse, starvation, burns and medical neglect, according to a new report by the Israeli Health Ministry that will be submitted to the United Nations this week. The report is based on interviews with the medical and welfare teams which treated more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages, most of whom were released in late November 2023, in a brief truce between Israel and Hamas. Eight hostages were rescued by the Israeli military. The hostages include more than 30 children and teenagers, a few of whom were found to have been bound, beaten or branded with a heated object, according to the report addressed to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and published late on Saturday. Women reported sexual assault by the captors, including at gunpoint. Men were beaten, starved, branded, held bound in isolation and denied access to a bathroom, the report said. Some were denied treatment for injuries and medical conditions. The report did not identify any of the hostages by name or age, to protect their privacy, but some of the descriptions matched those provided by hostages and staff that treated them in interviews with Reuters and other media and a U.N. report. Hamas has repeatedly denied abuse of the 251 hostages abducted from Israel during its October 7, 2023, assault. About half of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed by Israeli authorities to still be alive. A fresh bid to secure a Gaza ceasefire including a hostage deal has gained momentum in recent weeks, although no breakthrough has been reported as yet. The war began with Hamas' October 2023 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's subsequent campaign against Hamas has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced nearly all of Gaza's population and reduced much of its territory to rubble. Israeli authorities are investigating allegations of abuse against Palestinian detainees arrested during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-captors-tortured-hostages-including-minors-israeli-report-says-/7917461.html	2024-12-29T03:16:45-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday. Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. 'the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.' Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into 'a nuclear military bloc for aggression.' 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It said Kim's speech 'clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively' by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security. KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers. The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim 'fell in love.' But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals. Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-toughest-anti-us-policy-before-trump-takes-office/7917450.html	2024-12-29T02:19:11-08:00	
New Georgian president sworn in; predecessor says he is not legitimate leader	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Mikheil Kavelashvili, a hard-line critic of the West, was sworn in as president of Georgia on Sunday amid a political crisis after the government froze European Union application talks in a move that sparked major protests. Outgoing President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU opponent of the ruling party, said in a defiant speech to supporters outside the presidential palace that she was leaving the residence but that Kavelashvili had no legitimacy as president, which is a mostly ceremonial position. She said: 'I will come out of here and be with you.' 'I am taking legitimacy with me, I am taking the flag with me, I am taking your trust with me,' she added, before walking out of the palace to mingle with her supporters. Zourabichvili says that Kavelashvili was not duly picked, as the lawmakers who chose him were elected in an October parliamentary election that she says was marked by fraud. Georgia's opposition parties support her. The Georgian Dream ruling party and the country's election commission say that the October election was free and fair. The ruling party says Kavelashvili is the duly elected president. The presidential standoff is seen as a watershed moment in Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million that had until recently been regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states. Kavelashvili is a loyalist of Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire ex-prime minister who is widely seen as Georgia’s de facto leader. On Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Ivanishvili, saying he was spearheading Georgia’s current anti-Western and pro-Russian turn. Protesters hold up red cards Kavelashvili, a former professional soccer player who briefly played as a striker for Manchester City, has repeatedly accused Western intelligence agencies of plotting to drive Georgia into war with neighboring Russia. 'The Georgian people have always understood that peace is the main prerequisite for survival and development,' he said after being sworn in on Sunday. Protesters outside parliament held up red cards in a mocking reference to Kavelashvili's athletic career. Georgian Dream got almost 54% of the official vote in October's election. Local and international election monitors have said the vote was marked by violations that could have affected the results. Western countries have called for an investigation. Zourabichvili is backed by the country’s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate until fresh elections are held. The confrontation comes amid a month of protests sparked by Georgian Dream's suspension of EU accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a longstanding national goal of joining the bloc that is written into the country’s constitution. The move touched off widespread anger among Georgians, who polls show are firmly pro-EU, and prompted a police crackdown, with over 400 people, including senior opposition leaders, detained. Zourabichvili has accused Georgian Dream of deliberately sinking Georgia’s EU hopes and instead moving toward Russia, from which Georgia gained independence in 1991. Opposition supporters say that under Zourabichvili, who was elected with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018 before breaking with the party in recent years, the presidency was the only institution in the country not ultimately under the control of ruling party founder Ivanishvili. They say that with the installation of Kavelashvili, Ivanishvili will have total control over Georgia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-georgian-president-sworn-in-predecessor-says-he-is-not-legitimate-leader-/7917441.html	2024-12-29T01:38:33-08:00	
India shows no willingness to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh	India has shown no sign of complying with Bangladesh’s formal request to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from New Delhi. Hasina fled to India during the massive student-led protests of her regime earlier this year. The Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told local reporters earlier this week that the country’s interim government had informed India of their request to send Hasina back for a 'judicial process.' India confirmed receiving the request. 'At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,' said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, on Tuesday. Foreign policy experts in India have hinted that Hasina may not be sent back to Bangladesh so easily. Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, told VOA via WhatsApp that when Hasina was sent to India by the military for her own safety, there were no legal cases against her. This would complicate extradition, he said, because it is a judicial process that requires solid evidence of a crime. 'Moreover, the bilateral extradition treaty has political exception clauses as well as clauses for fair treatment and safety. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, extradition could be denied,' Chakravarty added. Officials belonging to Bangladesh’s acting government said that Hasina committed several major crimes during her 15-year regime to hold onto power. Bangladeshi student activist Nahid Islam, who serves as an adviser to the interim government, told VOA by phone that it is impossible to ensure proper democracy in the country until Hasina goes to trial. Islam went on to recount the events of the July-August protests, where peaceful student demonstrations turned deadly after a violent crackdown from security forces, acting on Hasina’s orders. 'More than 1,000 students and other protesters, and children, were killed during the July-August uprising. Hasina is the main accused in these cases,' he said. 'She must undergo trial in Bangladesh and be held answerable for her actions.' The Dhaka-based International Crime Tribunal, a court of justice that investigates and prosecutes domestic war crimes, has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and her associates. She has been accused of orchestrating a genocide during the 2024 protests, alongside other 'crimes against humanity' throughout her 15-year reign. Student leader Islam said that besides the crimes during the protests this year, Hasina is also responsible for several illegal acts during her regime. 'She led the government that orchestrated thousands of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. She is also accused of a massive level of malpractice during her regime,' Islam told VOA.' Islam said the interim government will ensure justice for all the victims of the student protest mass killings, and other crimes spanning Hasina’s regime. 'We believe it is our responsibility.' Zafar Sobhan, editor at the Bangladeshi English-language daily Dhaka Tribune, said the country’s demand for Hasina’s extradition is not only justified but should be uncontroversial and agreeable to anyone who 'cares about justice.' 'Sheikh Hasina is credibly accused of extremely grave crimes. Apart from being accused in the killings of hundreds during the mass uprising against her misrule in July and August, and of other serious cases of abuse of power, extrajudicial killing, disappearances, as well as massive corruption and looting of the public exchequer during her rule,' Sobhan told VOA by email. Sobhan said Hasina must stand trial to send the message that no one is above the law, even when in power. 'Rulers need to know that there will be accountability for their misdeeds, otherwise Bangladesh will continue to suffer misrule,' he said. Sheikh Hasina, who has been staying around New Delhi reportedly at a residence provided by the Indian government, has not made any comment after Bangladesh sought her extradition from India. But a senior leader of Hasina’s Awami League party said that the charges against the ousted PM were 'baseless.' 'The allegations of human rights violations, including enforced disappearance and extrajudicial killings, and other so-called malpractices during the regime of [former] Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are nothing but baseless propaganda. Since August 5 a long time has passed by but they have not been able to raise or prove any specific allegations against her or her government,' Sofioul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, organizing secretary of Hasina’s party, told VOA by text over WhatsApp. Former Bangladeshi diplomat Khalilur Rahman said that it is irrefutable that Hasina committed 'heinous crimes' that the world watched unfold in real time. He added that Bangladesh will hold her accountable, as they are obligated to follow the directions of the tribunal. 'We hope the Indian government will cooperate. Care should be taken to observe the extradition treaty between our two countries,' Rahman told VOA by text over WhatsApp. He is the senior representative of the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who leads Bangladesh’s interim government. Student leader Islam added that the interim government would take recourse through all legal and diplomatic means to bring Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial. 'India should cooperate in the process of the democratic transition in Bangladesh by extraditing Sheikh Hasina for trial in our country. That way we ... the two countries ... can bolster our diplomatic relationship,' Islam said. 'India will side with fascism, and stand against democratization in Bangladesh, if it does not extradite Hasina,' he added. Jon Danilowicz, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said that it is worthwhile for Bangladesh to pursue the request even if India refuses to extradite Hasina. 'This will serve as a constant reminder that Bangladesh will continue to seek justice. For its part, India will need to choose whether it stands with the Bangladeshi people or with the deposed dictator. Similarly, Bangladesh should press India to return Hasina’s henchmen who have also sought refuge across the border,' Danilowicz told VOA. 'India’s unwillingness to return these fugitives will be much more difficult to defend as it tries to position itself as a great power,' Danilowicz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-shows-no-willingness-to-extradite-sheikh-hasina-to-bangladesh/7917429.html	2024-12-29T00:37:07-08:00	
AI technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities	For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as 'rineanswsaurs' or sarcastic as 'srkastik.' The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension. 'I just assumed I was stupid,' she recalled of her early grade school years. But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her. 'I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them,' she said. New tech; countless possibilities Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities. There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including those with disabilities — are still learning. Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural. 'I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a cheat code in a video game,' said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: 'We're meeting students where they are.' Programs fortify classroom lessons Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. 'Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense,' he said. 'So if I plug that problem into AI, it'll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that.' He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. 'That's just cheating,' Ben said. Schools weigh pros, cons Schools have been trying to balance the technology's benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can't do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools. But the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices. 'There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That's always going to happen,' Sanft said. 'But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before.' Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient — about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state's education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes. Educators anticipate more tools The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing. 'We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children's handwriting, we fail very badly,' said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn't as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment. Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible. Mother sees potential Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. But Makenzie's mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own.

What is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?	The Native American Church is considered the most widespread religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for millennia. It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S. laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized Native American tribes to use the substance and don't apply to the broader group of Indigenous people in the United States. The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and 400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit. Why was the Native American Church incorporated? The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S. government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918. In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church, said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of North America. In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with several churches bringing Jesus Christ's name and image into the church so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore, who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. 'Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus, a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs,' he said. 'That probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in the process of transformation to Christianity.' This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way of Life Coalition. In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and set them on fire. 'I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green peyote that didn't burn,' he said, adding that it took decades of lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes to use peyote for religious purposes. How is peyote used in the Native American Church? Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual contemplation. Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine. 'When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up,' he said. 'Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don't drink it like regular tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take medicine.' Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: 'If you take care of the peyote, it will take care of you.' 'And if you believe in it, it will heal you,' he said, adding that he has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments. People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as God's spirit, Red Cloud said. 'Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and it opens the spiritual eye,' he said. 'From there, we start to see where the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine and give thanks to the Creator.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---what-is-the-native-american-church-and-why-is-peyote-sacred-to-members-/7915544.html	2024-12-28T23:22:25-08:00	
Virginia zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends	richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9 following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father, Corwin. One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo said. 'Most people don't get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we feel lucky to have received two over the years,' zoo officials said in a news release Tuesday. Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed 6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up to 270 kilograms. According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild. Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. 'For this reason, once Iris' two previous calves grew up, they were moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and continue contributing to the conservation of their species,' the news release said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-zoo-welcomes-newborn-pygmy-hippopotamus-as-year-ends/7915527.html	2024-12-28T23:21:49-08:00	
Elaborate holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way	CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music, drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn't been diminished by real estate turnover. Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. 'Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays and put it into a full circle,' she said. 'There's not somebody that's going to walk down the street and not feel included.' In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. 'She started crying and said, 'But this is the Christmas street! I want to live there!' ' he said. 'She got her way. We live here, we love it. All the neighbors bond together.' In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily spot the Miranda family's elaborate holiday light display featuring images and music from the movie 'Wicked.' Spotlights reminiscent of movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch's face takes shape across a towering tree. 'It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you can really do the drama with the lights,' said Elisabeth Miranda, who handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation. 'It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it needs to do at the right time.' The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge in traffic after being featured on ABC's 'The Great Christmas Light Fight.' While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal Order of Police. 'They give so much back to our community, so that's our little way of saying thank you to them for everything they do for us,' Miranda said. Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000 pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless people. Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. 'People are looking for joy,' Walters said. 'Our world is a tough place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of love and happiness — it's peaceful. We've never had one problem here at all. Everyone's been highly respectful of our home and full of gratitude.' Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000 people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. 'We bring joy to a lot of people,' he said. 'They walk around and they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/elaborate-holiday-light-displays-are-making-spirits-bright-in-a-big-way/7914333.html	2024-12-28T23:21:17-08:00	
Mexican prison board game brings together people from all walks of life	MEXICO CITY — On a Sunday afternoon in Mexico City's Roma neighborhood, Rosa María Espinosa joins nearly 80 men under a park pavilion to play poleana, a board game requiring mental dexterity that was born in the city's prisons nearly a century ago. Espinosa blows smoke rings with her cigarette and laughs with the others. Today she will be the only woman playing. Though the game's origins still carry a stigma, it is having a moment as people from diverse backgrounds discover its appeal. 'It's a lot of adrenaline,' said Espinosa. 'But sometimes the dice aren't lucky.' Playing for freedom Poleana is played on a square wooden box with a sunken center for dice rolling. Four players, each with four pieces, race to navigate the board, using specific dice combinations and calculations to move their pieces from their starting positions, around the board, and out through their designated corner, while strategically blocking opponents. The board symbolizes the confines of prison, and getting out before the others, winning freedom — even if just metaphorically — is the game's goal. 'People used to say 'these folks know how to play because they've been to prison,'' said the 62-year-old Espinosa. 'Thank God I've never been, but I like to play.' This afternoon's tournament marks the first time she's competed against anyone outside her circle of relatives or friends she usually plays with on Tuesdays and Sundays in the small chapel of her apartment complex. Ancient roots Alejandro Olmos, an archaeologist and anthropologist specializing in Mesoamerican games at the National Anthropology and History School, has studied and played poleana for years. He traces the game's origins to the Indian game chaupar (or pachisi), with archaeological evidence dating back to 600 A.D. After British colonization, the game spread to various Western countries under different names, including Ludo, Aggravation and Parcheesi. In the United States, game maker Parker Brothers marketed a similar game, which was based on the 1913 novel by Eleanor H. Porter Pollyanna. Sometime around 1940, the game spread in the lockups of Mexico City, with Lecumberri—a prison whose very architecture echoed the geometry of the poleana board — likely serving as its initial breeding ground. It was here where it was renamed poleana and received a new set of rules. 'All cultures have a process called adoption-transformation,' Olmos said. In Mexico, 'the game reflects the roughness of prison life: mistakes are not pardoned.' Poleana breaks out Six years ago, Jonathan Rulleri started a family business promoting poleana with the goal of bringing together people from different walks of life. One of the early challenges was establishing common rules for the game, 'which has been spreading from below, from prison to the street and from the street into neighborhoods,' said the 37-year-old Rulleri, who learned to play while incarcerated in the State of Mexico, outside the capital. After his release, he struggled to find work, a common problem for those who have been imprisoned. He launched a taco delivery service alongside his wife, but the business proved unsuccessful, leading him to reluctantly accept a commission to craft a poleana board for an acquaintance. Then came another commission — and he began to post his creations on social media. 'We dumped the taco idea and started making poleanas,' said Rulleri. The resulting business, Poleana Cana'da Frogs — a name derived from a slang word for prison and a description of the way the pieces hop around the board — has so far organized 55 poleana tournaments in public spaces, emphasizing a family-friendly atmosphere and explicitly excluding betting, a practice common in other poleana events. 'We want to remove the game's stigma, that it was a game for prisoners or slackers,' Rulleri said. In the 1980s, the game began to spread beyond the prisons and found purchase in many of Mexico City's rougher neighborhoods. Tepito — the capital's cradle of street commerce and boxing — is one of the neighborhoods where people can almost always be found playing poleana. At a handball court where men of all ages smack a ball against a wall, others on the sidelines play poleana late into the evening. Fernando Rojas, 57, learned poleana when he was 18, but it was in prison where he honed his talents. The games, which can last for hours, in prison happen back-to-back. 'It really helps you escape the reality of being a prisoner and that's how it started,' Rojas said. 'No one can understand what it's like to be a prisoner … you don't see the end of your sentence. There are people who have to do drugs as their way to escape. Poleana is very important in prison.' Now the game serves as Rojas' therapy: a way to relieve stress and avoid family conflict. He carries his dice and pieces in a small plastic bag, religiously joining his friends at the handball court to play. 'We all have problems, in prison and in the street,' he said. 'So a lot of people come here for a distraction.' In Poleana, plays and number combinations have names. For example, a roll of six is a 'six pack,' because that's what it looks like when seen from above. Rolling doubles prompts celebratory shouts of 'pares y no pares,' a play on Spanish words for pairs and not stopping. With luck, you could get a piece three-quarters of the way around the board. While chance plays a role, mathematical calculation is also key. That's why Diego González and Dana López are thrilled that their 7-year-old son Kevin is learning to play poleana. He has fun and he's getting faster with his calculations. González, 33, also makes poleana boards through his family business, Poleanas Iztapalapa, finding a creative outlet after serving a three-year sentence a decade ago. He crafts personalized boards with details like strobe lights and Bluetooth speakers. His boards are popular gifts for weddings, birthdays and Christmas. Some special commissions have included requests to include images of deceased loved ones in the sunken area where dice are tossed. Others want playful characters to decorate boards they give to their children. Sales surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were shut in their homes and found poleana to be a good way to pass the time. 'Two, three hours counting and tossing, and all that was really nice for them,' he said. 'They realized it's not a bad game, it's a game of strategy and getting the family together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-prison-board-game-brings-together-people-from-all-walks-of-life-/7914327.html	2024-12-28T23:20:45-08:00	
Abortions more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel	Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet. It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans. The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Here's a look at data on where things stand: Abortions are more common than before Dobbs Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the United States. One thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained. There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero. 'Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco. For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want. For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills. Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation. They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute. The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling. But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned. As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access. This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as 'controlled dangerous substances,' and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them. Travel for abortion has increased Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans. A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common. The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans. Abortion funds, which benefitted from 'rage giving' in 2022, helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give. The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a game-changer Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1 enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for them. There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer. While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor. Clinics have opened or expanded in some places The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states. But some states where abortion remains legal until viability – generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have seen clinics open and expand. Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics. There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers. Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even though they might provide few of them. Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients' lives How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned. President Joe Biden's administration said hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho. More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records. Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. 'It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,' Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortions-more-common-in-us-as-women-turn-to-pills-travel-/7917395.html	2024-12-28T18:45:35-08:00	
Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Iran, bracing for the possible re-imposition of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and U.N. economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry. The Iranian rial on Saturday hit a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar amid uncertainty about Trump's arrival in the White House on Jan. 20. The rial plunged to 820,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market, compared with 808,500 rials on Friday, according to Bonbast.com, which reports exchange rates. The bazar360.com website also said the dollar was being sold for about 820,500 rials. Also facing an inflation rate officially put at about 35%, Iranians seeking to shelter their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies. The rial has dropped about 18% in total since Trump was elected in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-2025-important-year-for-nuclear-issue/7917392.html	2024-12-28T17:24:42-08:00

UK to tax private schools in $1.9 B boost to public education	LONDON — The U.K. will end a tax exemption for private schools Wednesday, the center-left Labour government has announced, in a move set to raise over £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) for public education. After years of worsening educational inequalities, from Jan. 1, private schools will have to pay 20% value added tax on tuition fees, which will be used to fund thousands of new teachers and improve standards in state schools. 'It's time things are done differently,' finance minister Rachel Reeves said in a statement Sunday. The funding will 'go towards our state schools where 94% of this country's children are educated,' she said. The policy was promised by Labour in its election campaign and officially laid out in its inaugural budget in October. It hopes the move will bring in $1.9 billion for the 2025-2026 school year and rise to $2.1 billion a year by 2029-30, which will be used to fund 6,500 new teachers in the public sector. Tuition fees in private schools already average $22,600 a year, according to the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools. That figure is set to rise, with the government estimating that tuition fees will increase by around 10%, with schools taking on part of the additional cost. 'High and rising standards cannot just be for families who can afford them,' said education secretary Bridget Phillipson. Opponents of the reform say state school enrolment will explode if the private sector is lost, increasing the cost to the government. But studies contradict this. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the number of children in state schools will actually fall by 2030 due to a projected population decline. Several research centers also point out that the disparity between private and state schools widened sharply under the 14-year Conservative rule. The Labour government won a landslide election in July promising to boost economic growth and improve public services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-tax-private-schools-in-1-9-b-boost-to-public-education/7917387.html	2024-12-28T17:10:28-08:00	
North Korea launches 'toughest' US strategy during key party meeting	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key policy-setting meeting of the country's ruling party last week ahead of the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. The meeting of party and government officials decided that North Korea would launch the 'toughest' strategy to counteract the United States for its security and national interests, the report said, without elaborating. The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to a 'nuclear military bloc' and South Korea has become an 'anti-communist outpost' for the U.S., the KCNA report added. 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' it said. The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with 'friendly' countries during the meeting. Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to bolster the country's war deterrence. Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful Politburo of the party's Central Committee. The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a mutual defense pledge. Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries' military cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-declares-strongest-us-strategy-in-key-party-meeting-/7917386.html	2024-12-28T16:58:26-08:00	
Storms delay, cancel thousands of flights across US	Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the country. More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday, according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were canceled. About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, were delayed. At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement said. 'Those numbers will probably go up,' said forecaster Aaron Gleason, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain before New Year's Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located on the border of California and Nevada. 'Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,' the Weather Service warned. 'Widespread power outages are possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/storms-delay-cancel-thousands-of-flights-across-us-/7917383.html	2024-12-28T16:37:54-08:00	
Belarus' leader pardons 20 more prisoners; rights groups say repression continues	TALLINN, ESTONIA — Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 more people that rights activists describe as political prisoners, a statement on the president's website said Saturday. The announcement came amid persistent oppression in the run-up to presidential elections next month that are likely to extend Lukashenko's decadeslong rule. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released, but the statement posted on the website of the president said that all of them had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature.' The statement said the group included 11 women and 14 of those pardoned suffered from chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement, using wording familiar from a series of previous group pardons in the past six months. Saturday's announcement marks the eighth such pardon by Lukashenko since the summer of 2024. In all, 207 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarus' oldest and most established human rights group, Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. According to Viasna, over 1,250 political prisoners remain behind bars. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not been heard from for months on end, have been released. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Viasna founder Ales Bialiatski; Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote; and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression, said Viasna activist Pavel Sapelka, as Minsk prepares to hold new presidential elections in January 2025 that are likely to hand Lukashenko a seventh term in office. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals (to the West), pardoning some but jailing twice as many political prisoners in their place,' Sapelka said. 'Repression is intensifying, and authorities are trying to root out any signs of dissent before the January elections.' Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-leader-pardons-20-more-prisoners-rights-groups-say-repression-continues-/7917380.html	2024-12-28T16:19:32-08:00	
Olivia Hussey, star of the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' dies at 73	LONDON — Olivia Hussey, the actor who starred as a teenage Juliet in the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' has died, her family said on social media Saturday. She was 73. Hussey died on Friday, 'peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones,' a statement posted to her Instagram account said. Hussey was 15 when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her in his adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy after spotting her onstage in the play 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' which also starred Vanessa Redgrave. 'Romeo and Juliet' won two Oscars and Hussey won a Golden Globe for best new actress for her part as Juliet, opposite British actor Leonard Whiting, who was 16 at the time. Decades later, Hussey and Whiting brought a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud over nude scenes in the film. They alleged that they were initially told they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in a bedroom scene, but on the day of the shoot Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup, and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity. They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge. The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late. Whiting was among those paying tribute to Hussey on Saturday. 'Rest now my beautiful Juliet no injustices can hurt you now. And the world will remember your beauty inside and out forever,' he wrote. Hussey was born on April 17, 1951, in Bueno Aires, Argentina, and moved to London as a child. She studied at the Italia Conti Academy drama school. She also starred as Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the 1977 television series 'Jesus of Nazareth,' as well as in the 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie's 'Death on the Nile' and horror movies 'Black Christmas' and 'Psycho IV: The Beginning.' She is survived by her husband, David Glen Eisley, her three children and a grandson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/olivia-hussey-star-of-the-1968-film-romeo-and-juliet-dies-at-73/7917214.html	2024-12-28T15:28:25-08:00	
DR Congo rebels kill at least 21 in during Christmas week	BENI, DR CONGO — Islamic State group-linked ADF rebels have killed at least 21 people this week in the conflict-riven eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local sources told AFP on Saturday. The attacks all took place close to Manguredjipa, a town known for its rich mineral deposits and regularly targeted by the ADF. On December 21, ADF rebels made an incursion into the village of Robinet, in the Bapere sector of North Kivu province, a local official said. 'They killed six people on the spot, then on December 22 they arrived at the neighboring village we call Kodjo where they killed 12 people,' Macaire Sivikunula, a representative for the Bapere sector's governor, told AFP. Then on Christmas Day, ADF fighters 'arrived seven kilometers from Manguredjipa in the village called Makele and killed three people,' Sivikunula added. Multiple separate local sources confirmed the dates, locations and tolls of these attacks to AFP. Originally from Uganda, the ADF, or Allied Democratic Forces, have been present since the mid-1990s in the DRC's restive northeast, where its fighters have killed thousands of civilians. In 2019, the ADF pledged allegiance to IS. The IS touts them as its Islamic State Central Africa Province and claims responsibility for some of the rebel group's attacks. At the end of 2021, Uganda and the DRC launched a joint military operation against the ADF. That offensive has so far proven unsuccessful in putting an end to the rebel attacks. Both armies have pushed the rebels back into remote and inaccessible areas, where local civilians are often at their mercy. Sivikunula said the Ugandan and Congolese armies were present and at work in Manguredjipa. 'But as the rebels are scattered in small groups of dispersed fighters, it's really difficult to pinpoint their location,' he added. North Kivu province also faces a separate rebel insurgency further south, with the Rwanda-backed M23 movement and the DRC's army locked in fighting all week following the failure of a peace summit in mid-December. Home to vast mineral resources, the eastern DRC has been plagued by infighting between various armed groups for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-rebels-kill-at-least-21-in-during-christmas-week-/7917197.html	2024-12-28T14:28:44-08:00	
Efforts to free reporter held in Iran 'complicated,' says Italy	ROME — Efforts to release Italian journalist Cecilia Sala from prison in Iran are 'complicated,' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Saturday. Sala was detained on December 19 by police in Tehran and is being held in the city's notorious Evin prison, according to her employer. 'We are trying to resolve a complicated issue and to ensure in the meantime that Cecilia Sala is detained in the best possible conditions,' Tajani said. Asked when she might be released, he said 'I hope shortly, but it does not depend on us.' 'She is obviously detained, which is not ideal, but she is fed and in a single cell,' he said. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said she was 'following the complex affair' closely, and Rome was pursuing 'all possible avenues of dialogue' to bring Sala home 'as soon as possible.' Chora Media, an Italian podcast publisher for which Sala worked, said she had traveled from Rome to Iran on December 12 on a journalist visa, and was due to return on December 20. But she went quiet on December 19 and then did not board her flight. Shortly afterwards she called her mother to say she had been arrested, it said. 'She was taken to Evin prison, where dissidents are held, and the reason for her arrest has not yet been formalized,' Chora Media said in a statement Friday. Sala also worked for Italian newspaper Il Foglio, which said she had been in Iran 'to report on a country she knows and loves.' 'Journalism is not a crime, even in countries that repress all freedoms, including those of the press. Bring her home,' it said. Sala, reported to be 29 years old, last posted on X on December 17, with a link to a podcast entitled 'A conversation on patriarchy in Tehran.' She had previously reported from Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/efforts-to-free-reporter-held-in-iran-complicated-says-italy/7917176.html	2024-12-28T14:02:41-08:00	
Turkish FM discusses with Blinken need to cooperate with new Syrian administration	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey's foreign minister discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday the need to act in cooperation with the new Syrian administration to ensure the completion of the transition period in an orderly manner, the ministry said. In a phone call, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken that Ankara would not allow Kurdish YPG militia to take shelter in Syria, the ministry spokesperson said. During the call, Blinken emphasized the need to support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that 'upholds human rights and prioritizes an inclusive and representative government,' according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. Blinken and Fidan also discussed preventing terrorism from endangering the security of Turkey and Syria, the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-fm-discusses-with-blinken-need-to-cooperate-with-new-syrian-administration/7917171.html	2024-12-28T13:33:31-08:00	
Drought, fire, deforestation ravaged Amazon rainforest in 2024	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — 2024 was a brutal year for the Amazon rainforest, with rampant wildfires and extreme drought ravaging large parts of a biome that's a critical counterweight to climate change. A warming climate fed drought that in turn fed the worst year for fires since 2005. And those fires contributed to deforestation, with authorities suspecting some fires were set to more easily clear land to run cattle. The Amazon is twice the size of India and sprawls across eight countries and one territory, storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet. It has about 20% of the world's fresh water and astounding biodiversity, including 16,000 known tree species. But governments have historically viewed it as an area to be exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples, and experts say exploitation by individuals and organized crime is rising at alarming rates. 'The fires and drought experienced in 2024 across the Amazon rainforest could be ominous indicators that we are reaching the long-feared ecological tipping point,' said Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that works to protect the rainforest. 'Humanity's window of opportunity to reverse this trend is shrinking, but still open.' There were some bright spots. The level of Amazonian forest loss fell in both Brazil and Colombia. And nations gathered for the annual United Nations conference on biodiversity agreed to give Indigenous peoples more say in nature conservation decisions. 'If the Amazon rainforest is to avoid the tipping point, Indigenous people will have been a determinant factor,' Miller said. Wildfires and extreme drought Forest loss in Brazil's Amazon — home to the largest swath of this rainforest — dropped 30.6% compared to the previous year, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. The improvement under leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva contrasted with deforestation that hit a 15-year high under Lula's predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. In July, Colombia reported historic lows in deforestation in 2023, driven by a drop in environmental destruction. The country's environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that 2024's figures may not be as promising because a significant rise in deforestation had already been recorded by July due to dry weather caused by El Nino, a weather phenomenon that warms the central Pacific. Illegal economies continue to drive deforestation in the Andean nation. 'It's impossible to overlook the threat posed by organized crime and the economies they control to Amazon conservation,' said Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Illegal gold mining is expanding rapidly, driven by soaring global prices, and the revenues of illicit economies often surpass state budgets allocated to combat them.' In Brazil, large swaths of the rainforest were draped in smoke in August from fires raging across the Amazon, Cerrado savannah, Pantanal wetland and the state of Sao Paulo. Fires are traditionally used for deforestation and for managing pastures, and those man-made blazes were largely responsible for igniting the wildfires. For a second year, the Amazon River fell to desperate lows, leading some countries to declare a state of emergency and distribute food and water to struggling residents. The situation was most critical in Brazil, where one of the Amazon River's main tributaries dropped to its lowest level ever recorded. Cesar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who lives in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, said he believes people are becoming increasingly aware of the Amazon's fundamental role 'for the survival of society as a whole.' But, like Miller, he worries about a 'point of no return of Amazon destruction.' It was the worst year for Amazon fires since 2005, according to nonprofit Rainforest Foundation U.S. Between January and October, an area larger than the state of Iowa — about 15.1 million hectares of Brazil's Amazon — burned. Bolivia had a record number of fires in the first 10 months of the year. 'Forest fires have become a constant, especially in the summer months and require particular attention from the authorities who don't how to deal with or respond to them,' Ipenza said. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Guyana also saw a surge in fires this year. Indigenous voices, rights made headway The United Nations conference on biodiversity — this year known as COP16 — was hosted by Colombia. The meetings put the Amazon in the spotlight and a historic agreement was made to give Indigenous groups more of a voice on nature conservation decisions, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize Indigenous people's role in protecting land and combating climate change. Both Ebus and Miller saw promise in the appointment of Martin von Hildebrand as the new secretary general for the Amazon Treaty Cooperation Organization, announced during COP16. 'As an expert on Amazon communities, he will need to align governments for joint conservation efforts. If the political will is there, international backers will step forward to finance new strategies to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest,' Ebus said. Ebus said Amazon countries need to cooperate more, whether in law enforcement, deploying joint emergency teams to combat forest fires, or providing health care in remote Amazon borderlands. But they need help from the wider world, he said. 'The well-being of the Amazon is a shared global responsibility, as consumer demand worldwide fuels the trade in commodities that finance violence and environmental destruction,' he said. Next year marks a critical moment for the Amazon, as Belem do Para in northern Brazil hosts the first United Nations COP in the region that will focus on climate. 'Leaders from Amazon countries have a chance to showcase strategies and demand tangible support,' Ebus said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-fire-deforestation-ravaged-amazon-rainforest-in-2024/7917162.html	2024-12-28T13:14:49-08:00	
Elon Musk vows 'war' over H-1B visas in rift with Trump supporters	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, vowed to go to 'war' to defend the H-1B visa program for foreign tech workers late Friday amid a dispute between President-elect Donald Trump's longtime supporters and his most recently acquired backers from the tech industry. In a post on social media platform X, Musk said, 'The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.' 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his electric-car company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas this year. H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Musk's tweet was directed at Trump's supporters and immigration hardliners who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas. Trump has so far remained silent on the issue. The Trump transition did not respond to a request for comment on Musk's tweets and the H-1B visa debate. In the past, Trump has expressed a willingness to provide more work visas to skilled workers. He has also promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens, and severely restrict immigration. The issue highlights how tech leaders such as Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base. The U.S. tech industry relies on the government's H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens. The altercation was set off this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued 'big tech oligarchs' for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization. In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration. Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917156.html	2024-12-28T12:40:38-08:00	
Bloodied Ukrainian troops risk losing hard-won land in Kursk to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk, a region some want to hold at all costs while others question the value of having gone in at all. Battles are so intense that some Ukrainian commanders can't evacuate the dead. Communication lags and poorly timed tactics have cost lives, and troops have little way to counterattack, seven frontline soldiers and commanders told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so they could discuss sensitive operations. Since being caught unaware by the lightning Ukrainian incursion, Russia has amassed more than 50,000 troops in the region, including some from its ally North Korea. Precise numbers are hard to obtain, but Moscow's counterattack has killed and wounded thousands and the overstretched Ukrainians have lost more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers of Kursk they seized in August. Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But five Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1,000-kilometer front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. 'We have, as they say, hit a hornet's nest. We have stirred up another hot spot,' said Stepan Lutsiv, a major in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Border raid turned occupation Army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukraine launched the operation because officials thought Russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast Ukraine. It began on August 5 with an order to leave Ukraine's Sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. It became an occupation that Ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gathering his men, one company commander told them: 'We're making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn't been done since World War II. Privately, he was less certain. 'It seemed crazy,' he said. 'I didn't understand why.' Shocked by the success achieved largely because the Russians were caught by surprise, the Ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of Korenevo, 25 kilometers into Russia. That was one of the first places where Russian troops counterattacked. By early November the Russians began regaining territory rapidly. Once in awe of what they accomplished, troops' opinions are now shifting as they come to terms with losses. The company commander said half of his troops were dead or wounded. Some frontline commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low, and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying Kursk. Another commander said that some orders his men have received don't reflect reality because of delays in communication. Delays occur especially when territory is lost to Russian troops, he said. 'They don't understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what's under our control, and what isn't,' he said. 'They don't understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion.' One platoon commander said higher-ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit's defensive position because he knows his men can't hold the line. 'Those people who stand until the end are ending up MIA,' he said. He said he also knows of at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties. Russia doubles down Ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive Russian response in Kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back. 'There's no other option. We'll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won't stop; they'll keep advancing,' said one drone unit commander. Ukraine's General Staff told The Associated Press in a written response to questions that Ukrainian combat units are inflicting losses to Russian personnel and military equipment on a daily basis, and they are provided with 'everything necessary' to carry out combat duties. 'Troops are managed in accordance to situational awareness and operational information, taking into the account the operational situation in areas where tasks are performed,' the response said. American longer-range weapons have slowed the Russian advance and North Korean soldiers who joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, Ukrainian troops said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. But they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines. One clash took place last week near Vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of Kremenne and Vorontsovo. Until last week, the area was under Ukraine's control. This week part of it has been lost to Russian forces and Ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route. Eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the Donbas — where Russia is closing on a crucial supply hub — some soldiers are more vocal about whether Kursk has been worth it. 'All the military can think about now is that Donbas has simply been sold,' the platoon commander said. 'At what price?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bloodied-ukrainian-troops-risk-losing-more-hard-won-land-in-kursk-to-russia/7917149.html	2024-12-28T12:23:31-08:00	
Afghan forces target Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes	Afghanistan's Taliban Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces hit several points inside Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes last week. Pakistan last Tuesday launched an operation to destroy a training facility and kill insurgents in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province. The strikes killed dozens of people, mostly women and children. Comments from the Taliban Defense Ministry on Saturday, posted on social media platform X, said its forces targeted Pakistani points that 'served as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' Ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khwarzami gave no further information about the strikes, including how they were carried out and if there were any casualties on either side. However, a pro-Taliban media outlet, Hurriyet Daily News, cited ministry sources as saying that the strikes killed 19 Pakistani troops and three Afghan civilians. No one from Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry was immediately available for comment. People celebrated Afghanistan's retaliation in the country's southeastern Khost province, according to the organizer, Rasheedullah Hamdard. Thousands turned out to show their happiness and assure the Afghan military of their support against Pakistan. Khost neighbors Paktika, which was targeted last week. 'All of them were chanting angry slogans against this action by Pakistan, such as ‘death to Pakistan,’' Hamdard said. 'All Afghans are brothers, so it is necessary that the nation and government show their pride in their blood.' Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat cross-border militant activity, a charge the Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country from Afghan soil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-forces-target-pakistan-in-retaliation-for-deadly-airstrikes/7917118.html	2024-12-28T10:52:40-08:00	
Assad’s fall opens new dynamics in Middle East, regional analysts say	AMMAN, JORDAN — The overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime has opened the door to new dynamics in the Middle East, regional analysts say, with Turkey likely gaining superiority, Iran reeling and, with that, Iraq gaining more freedom from Iranian pressure. The Assad government in Syria spanned 54 years in power — first with the elder Hafez al-Assad and later with son Bashar of the minority Alawite community, a branch of Shiite Islam. Regional analysts say its fall marks a seismic shift in Middle East politics. Sinan Ulgen, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe speaking during a Carnegie Middle East Center webinar on Dec. 19 in Beirut, called it a 'political earthquake' with far-reaching regional implications. 'Fundamentally, we now see the emergence of a government in Syria that maybe after 50 years really is likely to be more pro-Turkey than pro-Iran,' Ulgen said. 'This is a lasting change in the regional power constellation, which is another reason why the fall of Assad has been welcomed with such zeal in Ankara,' the capital of Turkey. Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of the Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel’s attacks on Iran’s assets in Syria and its Hezbollah proxies in neighboring Lebanon, as well as Israeli military strikes in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran, 'present a moment of regional reckoning' for Iran. 'It [Iran] is definitely on the backfoot,' she said. 'There is now a strategic rethink ... happening in the establishment about where their policies — both at home and abroad — go from here.' Geranmayeh said prominent figures in Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps are likely to be replaced with others, given the nation’s demoted regional status and the near demise of its so-called axis of resistance in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. She said that Iran likely will spin a narrative that the late Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani’s regional project to surround Israel with a so-called ring of fire has been 'accomplished,' and that Iran will look to devise other plans to deal with the new reality it faces. Harith Hasan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said, 'Iraq is the last stronghold for Iran’s axis of resistance,' but that, too, could be changing. 'So, Iran might try to strongly defend that influence,' Hasan said. 'But as we see, the balance of power has shifted a lot, and the Iraqi government gained more freedom to be able to resist some of the pressure coming from Tehran.' Hasan said concerns about a possible Islamist-led government in Syria is giving cause for concern to its neighbors, as well as to regional political influencers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That, he said, 'could give Iraq new leverage' because of its long border with Syria and strong cross-border ties between the two countries. Hasan said that also may give Iraq a way out from under Iran’s influence, as developments in the region continue to unfold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-fall-opens-new-dynamics-in-middle-east-regional-analysts-say/7917110.html	2024-12-28T10:42:48-08:00

Russia to stop gas exports to Moldova beginning Jan. 1	MOSCOW / CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — Russian energy giant Gazprom said Saturday it would suspend gas exports to Moldova from 0500 GMT on Jan. 1 due to unpaid debt by Moldova, which is bracing for severe power cuts. It said the company reserved the right to take any action, including terminating the supply contract with Moldova. Russia supplies Moldova with about 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year, which is piped via Ukraine to the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where it is used to generate cheap power that is sold to government-controlled parts of Moldova. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean condemned the Russian decision, which is a precursor to a total shutdown of Russian gas exports via Ukraine and to Europe, where it flows farther to Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Italy, once a current transit deal with Ukraine expires on Dec. 31. Moldova will be hit the hardest by the shutdown. 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transdniestrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' Recean wrote on Facebook, accusing Russia of using energy as a political weapon. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed those allegations. Difference over debt Russia, which is critical of Moldova's West-leaning central government, has said Moldova should pay a debt on past supplies. According to Russian calculations, the debt stands at $709 million. Moldova has put the debt at $8.6 million. Gazprom has said previously it wants Moldova to pay the debt before it starts to pump gas to the country via alternate routes. Transdniestria and the government in Chisinau agreed in 2022 that all Russian gas received by Moldova would flow to the breakaway region, which traditionally does not pay for fuel. Without gas supplies, the power-generating plant could stop working and Moldova and Transdniestria would face hourslong blackouts like those experienced by Ukraine due to Russia's attacks on its energy infrastructure in their war. Recean said Moldova had diversified sources of gas supply 'in order to reduce dependence on a single supplier.' 'Our country is prepared to handle any situation that arises following the Kremlin's decision,' he said. Moldova's population of 2.5 million has been preparing for long power cuts since Ukraine's government said it will not extend its transit contract with Gazprom. Moldova and Transdniestria have declared states of emergency over the threat of disrupted gas supplies, and Moldova said Friday it will curb power exports and introduce measures to reduce consumption by at least a third beginning Jan. 1. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has accused Gazprom of provoking an energy crisis, saying it was refusing to supply gas through an alternate route.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-stop-gas-exports-to-moldova-beginning-jan-1/7917083.html	2024-12-28T10:13:58-08:00	
Sweden searches for more cemetery space in case of war	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN — Burial associations in Sweden are looking to acquire enough land for something they hope they'll never have to do: bury thousands of people in the event of war. The search follows recommendations from the Church of Sweden’s national secretariat, which reflect crisis preparedness guidelines from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the Swedish Armed Forces. The preparedness guidelines have been put in a new light by Sweden's decision to join NATO and tensions with Russia in the Baltic Sea region. According to the Church of Sweden provisions, supported by legal paragraphs in Sweden’s Burial Act, burial associations are responsible for ensuring the availability of enough land to bury roughly 5% of the population within a parish, if needed. The Goteborg Burial Association, which operates in Sweden’s second-largest city, is currently trying to navigate the challenge of acquiring at least 40,470 square meters (about 10 acres) of land to ensure it can handle urgent casket burials for some 30,000 dead in case of war. That is in addition to another 60,700 square meters (about 15 acres) of land needed for building graveyards for regular use in Goteborg. 'The [recommendations] mean that we need more land for burial grounds and this is a phenomenon in the big cities, and a problem in the big cities, where land resources are scarce to begin with and not always sufficient to meet burial-ground needs even in times of calm and peace,' said Katarina Evenseth, senior adviser at the Goteborg Burial Association. Together with the local municipality, which has a monopoly in making decisions about land usage in Goteborg, the burial association has identified a vast area appropriate for building a large-scale cemetery for the intended purpose. But a lengthy approval and building process means it could take approximately 10 years to complete, posing further challenges in uncertain times. Meanwhile, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, or MSB, continues to stress the importance of crisis preparedness and highlights the efforts of the Church of Sweden. 'Already back in 2015 the Government assigned various authorities to once again start engaging in civil defense planning, and many organizations have started planning, with the Church of Sweden being at the forefront of that planning,' said Jan-Olof Olsson, critical infrastructure protection expert at MSB. 'Unfortunately, it is the case that we are reminded to a greater degree that war could happen and that we simply need to be prepared for that,' Olsson said. Sweden pursued a policy of neutrality from the early 19th century, including during World War II. But public opinion shifted sharply in 2022 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to Sweden and Finland applying to join the transatlantic alliance out of concern about the threat from their newly aggressive Russian neighbor across the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Finland sent out updated civil preparedness guides in November with instructions on how to survive in war. The guides are like those in Denmark and Norway, although they don't mention Russia by name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-searches-for-more-cemetery-space-in-case-of-war/7917072.html	2024-12-28T10:01:45-08:00	
Extremist groups harass Kashmiri vendors in northern India	SRINAGAR, INDIAN-ADMINISTERED KASHMIR — Nomadic shawl vendors from the Indian side of Kashmir told VOA Friday that extremist Hindu groups have been harassing, threatening and obstructing them from selling their goods in Himachal Pradesh, a northern Indian state. Hindu groups claim that the local shopkeepers lose business when nomadic vendors sell their wares nearby. Sandeep Dhawal, police superintendent in the Bilaspur district, quoted in Friday’s edition of the Indian Express, a leading Indian newspaper, acknowledged that more than a dozen shawl vendors filed a complaint at the Ghumarwin police station. Dhawal said a similar dispute arose last year between Kashmiri hawkers and local shopkeepers, who claimed financial losses because of the vendors. 'No physical assault has been reported,' he told the Indian Express. 'We have requested the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Bilaspur to mediate and resolve the issue amicably. A meeting between both parties is expected within the next day or two.' The Indian Express reported that senior officials attributed the harassment claims to 'business rivalry' between the Kashmiri vendors and local shopkeepers affiliated with the Ghumarwin Beopar Mandal. A police investigation is under way. The traders said they have been visiting the region for more than 30 years but are facing threats and pressure this year to leave the state, where they stay for a few months annually. Kashmir vendors sell leather jackets, socks, bags and Kashmir-handmade Pashmina shawls. They also sell ladies suits. They move to different states of India to sell these items in the beginning of November and return after March. They carry their goods on their shoulders and sell them anywhere they find customers. 'For the past three days we have been forced by some Hindu extremist groups to stop selling our goods. They tell us to pack up our belongings and go back to Kashmir,' a trader currently residing in the Ghumarwin area of Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, said to VOA on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. 'These threats and intimidations used to happen occasionally, but this year when we go to the market to purchase food and other essentials, we are mistreated there as well,' he said. He noted it has become difficult for them to even 'step out' of their rented accommodations. The trader said he and his fellow vendors asked the Hindu groups whether they considered Kashmiris less Indian. 'We also told them, ‘If people from other parts of India can work in Kashmir, then why we can’t work here?’' the trader said. 'Instead of apologizing, they threatened us with dire consequences if we don’t leave Himachal Pradesh. They also accused us of being anti-nationals and terror sympathizers.' Thousands of Kashmiris travel every winter to various Indian states to sell handmade goods such as shawls, suits and leather jackets door-to-door or street-to-street. They say they sometimes face difficulties — verbal abuse, physical assault and boycott calls — because of their regional identity and the growing communal tensions in India. The traders say such incidents were rare before 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came to power. 'Before 2014, only an insane person would make such statements or resort to violence, but today it has become common,' Peerzada Mohammad Shafi Shah, a leather jacket vendor, told VOA from Salt Lake City, West Bengal. 'Muslims, particularly Kashmiris, are seen as enemies in almost every part of India. There are three to four states where communalism is so high that the majority of Kashmiris have stopped going there,' Shah said. 'Had the government of Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, taken action in the beginning, things could have been much better.' The traders in Himachal Pradesh claimed people affiliated with Hindu extremist groups have threatened them and the owners of buildings where they stay, either individually or in groups. 'We are being warned that they are being polite now, and if we do not comply, they will return and their language will be different,' another Kashmiri shawl seller told VOA, on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety. 'No one else has issues with us except them. They give absurd reasons, like claiming that local shopkeepers in Himachal Pradesh suffer because of us, even though their line of work is entirely different from ours,' he said. Maqsood Khan, one of the traders, said that following the police complaint, the deputy superintendent of the Ghumarwin police department visited them. He said the police officer spoke with representatives on both sides of the disagreement and instructed the accused persons not to harass the Kashmiri traders. 'The deputy superintendent of police told the opposing party that we, too, have the right to sell our products, just like the local shopkeepers in the area,' he said. 'This has eased temporarily,' but the situation will be remedied 'only after the representatives of both sides will express each other’s concerns in front of [the] deputy commissioner.' Meanwhile, Ifra Jan, the spokesperson of J&K’s ruling party, National Conference, told VOA by phone the lives and security of Kashmiri traders across India is crucial to her party. 'When we got to know about the harassment case, when these people were mishandled and abused and threatened, the Chief Minister of J&K Omar Abdullah immediately got in touch with chief minister of Himachal Pradesh,' Jan said. 'The Himachal Pradesh government has now taken cognizance of the matter, and his office is ensuring a safe and secure environment for the Kashmiri traders and students living there.' VOA contacted the Ghumarwin police department about the latest developments in the situation, although officers there said only higher officials can speak about the matter, and they were not available for comment. Earlier in November, a female official from a Panchayat, a local self-government body in Indian villages, told Kashmiri shawl sellers not to trade in Himachal Pradesh. In a video, she told them to leave the village and chanted 'hail Lord Ram' — one of the revered deities in Hinduism. She later apologized for those comments after being summoned to the Himachal Pradesh police station. 'We want to put an end to this unwanted controversy and live happily and peacefully alongside [our] Hindu brethren in the state,' Khan the trader said. 'We urge governments of both regions to do the needful' and take steps to end the harassment, 'to address the issue once and for all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/extremist-groups-harass-kashmiri-vendors-in-northern-india/7917048.html	2024-12-28T09:37:14-08:00	
Trump energy plans complicated by tariffs, global competition	A different approach to energy is at the center of President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to bring down the cost of living for Americans.

Putin apologizes to Azerbaijan for 'tragic incident' of plane crash	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday apologized to his Azerbaijani counterpart for what he called a 'tragic incident' following the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner in Kazakhstan that killed 38 people. The Kremlin said in a statement that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, due to a Ukrainian drone strike as the plane attempted to land Wednesday. It stopped short of saying the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin apologized to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev 'for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace.' The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan and crashed while trying to land. There were 29 survivors. On Friday, a U.S. official and an Azerbaijani minister made separate statements blaming the crash on an external weapon. Friday’s assessments by Rashan Nabiyev and White House national security spokesperson John Kirby echoed those made by outside aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defense systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. Neither Kirby nor the Azerbaijani minister directly addressed the statements blaming air defenses. Kirby told reporters Friday that the U.S. has 'seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems,' but he refused to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. Nabiyev, Azerbaijan’s minister of digital development and transportation, told Azerbaijani media that 'preliminary conclusions by experts point to external impact,' as does witness testimony. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea. He didn’t comment on statements from some aviation experts who pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems. Earlier this week, Rosaviatsia cited unspecified early evidence as showing that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. In the days following the crash, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed 'physical and technical interference' and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didn’t say where the interference came from or provide any further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-apologizes-to-azerbaijan-for-tragic-incident-of-plane-crash/7916971.html	2024-12-28T07:23:21-08:00	
South Africa reroutes Mozambique trade, travel to Eswatini border amid violence	MBABANE, ESWATINI — As Mozambique grapples with a political crisis following a disputed national election and violent protests, the situation at its southern border with South Africa is increasingly volatile, affecting trade and travel. The violence in Mozambique forced trade and travel to be diverted from South Africa’s Leebombo Border Post to Eswatini’s Mananga Border Post, with Mananga serving as a makeshift lifeline for those seeking passage from Mozambique. Michael Masiapato, commissioner of South Africa’s Border Management Authority, told VOA that although authorities are managing the crisis, it continues to pose significant challenges. 'Even ... when they deploy the military and when they deploy police officers on the corridor [between the capital, Maputo, and the border], it is not able to cover each and every area,' he said. The protests, he said, are 'very much sporadic' and 'very much widespread.' Following presidential candidate Daniel Chapo's controversial election victory Monday, Mozambique plunged into turmoil, leaving scores dead amid violent protests. Some analysts expressed concern that continued political violence could destabilize regional security and impede economic development, sparking weapons proliferation and criminal activity. Solomon Mondlane, a political analyst in Mozambique, told VOA he is cautiously optimistic that South African and European efforts can help calm the situation. 'The situation is volatile,' Mondlane said. 'The good news is we're hearing more calls from different countries — from South Africa, from other European countries — calling for more dialogue. South Africa has come out to say they are willing to facilitate a dialogue. 'We know that South Africa's ANC-led government has been in support of Frelimo,' the ruling political party,' he said. 'They were the first to congratulate Frelimo for winning these rigged elections. But we are happy that they are adhering to the calls now to say we are willing to facilitate dialogue between the opposition in Mozambique and the ruling party.' Levy Ndou, a South African political analyst and lecturer at Tshwane University of Technology in Johannesburg, said he believes regional players’ efforts at dialogue with the Mozambican government are encouraging signs that many in the region are seeking peace and stability. 'Of course, if the situation gets out of hand, it will therefore require the intervention of SADC in order to ensure that there is peace, there is stability and, indeed, there is economic activity that is going on,' Ndou said, referring to the Southern African Development Community. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the SADC chair, has said the regional bloc is ready to assist Mozambique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-reroutes-mozambique-trade-travel-to-eswatini-border-amid-violence/7916961.html	2024-12-28T07:10:44-08:00	
Turkey's pro-Kurd party to meet jailed PKK leader on Saturday	ISTANBUL — A delegation from Turkey's main pro-Kurdish DEM party is due on Saturday to visit jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence on a prison island off Istanbul, a party source said. 'The delegation left in the morning,' the source told AFP, without elaborating how they would travel to the island for security reasons. The visit would be the party's first in almost 10 years. DEM's predecessor, the HDP party, last met Ocalan in April 2015. On Friday, the government approved DEM's request to visit Ocalan, who founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, nearly half a century ago and has languished in solitary confinement since 1999. The PKK is regarded as a terror organization by Turkey and most of its Western allies, including the United States and European Union. The DEM party delegation is made up of two lawmakers — Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan. They are not expected to make a statement after the visit, the same source told AFP. Detained 25 years ago in a Hollywood-style operation by Turkish security forces in Kenya after years on the run, Ocalan was sentenced to death. He escaped the gallows when Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2004 and is spending his remaining years in an isolation cell on the Imrali prison island south of Istanbul. Saturday's rare visit became possible after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's nationalist ally Devlet Bahceli invited Ocalan to come to parliament to renounce 'terror' and to disband the militant group. Bahceli, who heads the ultra-nationalist MHP party, is fiercely hostile to the PKK. Erdogan backed the unprecedented appeal as a 'historic window of opportunity.' 'My dear Kurdish brothers, we expect you to firmly grasp [Bahceli's] sincerely outstretched hand,' he said in October, urging them to join in efforts to build what he called the 'century of Turkey.' Soon after Bahceli's call, Ocalan was allowed his first family visit since March 2020, prompting DEM to make its own request to the Justice Ministry to visit the 75-year-old militant. PKK militants subsequently claimed responsibility for an attack in October on a Turkish defense firm that killed five. That delayed the government approval of DEM's request. For several years up to 2015, Ocalan was engaged in talks with authorities, when then-Prime Minister Erdogan called for a solution for what is often called Turkey's 'Kurdish problem.' The peace process and a truce collapsed in 2015, sparking the resumption of violence, especially in the Kurdish-majority southeast. The government's surprise olive branch to the Kurds comes after rebels in neighboring Syria overthrew strongman president Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Turkey routinely targets Kurdish fighters in northern Syria and Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-pro-kurd-party-to-meet-jailed-pkk-leader-on-saturday/7916870.html	2024-12-28T03:37:00-08:00	
Ukraine says it struck drone depot in Russia's Oryol region	Ukraine said on Saturday it had struck a storage and maintenance depot for long-range Shahed drones in Russia's Oryol region, adding that this had 'significantly reduced' Russia's ability to launch mass drone attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine military's general staff said in a statement on Telegram the attack took place on Thursday and was conducted by Ukraine's air force. 'As a result of the strike, a depot for storage, maintenance and repair of Shahed kamikaze drones, made of several protected concrete structures, was destroyed,' it said. 'This military operation has significantly reduced the enemy's potential in terms of conducting air raids of strike drones on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.' Moscow has not made any comment on the attack. Russia has regularly launched missile and drone attacks on Ukraine throughout its 34-month invasion. For the past several months, Moscow has launched near-daily barrages of dozens of drones at Ukraine, hoping to damage its infrastructure and wear down air defenses leaving them less able to shoot down missiles. Ukraine's air force said earlier on Saturday it had downed 15 out of 16 drones launched by Russia overnight, with the other one disappearing from radar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-struck-drone-depot-in-russia-s-oryol-region/7916862.html	2024-12-28T03:16:24-08:00	
Major Gaza hospital shut after Israeli raid, officials say	GAZA STRIP — An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the World Health Organization and health officials said Saturday. The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility 'useless,' further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said. 'This morning's raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital has put this last major health facility in north Gaza out of service. Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid,' the World Health Organization said overnight on X, referring to the Israeli operation that began in the early hours of Friday. The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remain in the hospital. Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the U.N. health agency said, adding it was 'deeply concerned for their safety.' Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces detained Kamal Adwan Hospital's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members. Gaza's civil defense agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout. The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. In the days leading up to the raid, Abu Safiyeh had repeatedly warned about the hospital's precarious situation, accusing Israeli forces of targeting the facility. On Monday, he issued a statement accusing Israel of targeting the hospital 'with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside.' On Thursday, Abu Safiyeh said five staff members of the hospital had been killed in an Israeli strike near the facility. Since Oct. 6, Israel has intensified its land and air offensive in northern Gaza, saying its goal is to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping. The military said Friday that it was acting on intelligence regarding 'terrorist infrastructure and operatives' in the hospital's vicinity. 'Heinous crime' Before initiating the latest operation near the hospital, the military said its troops had 'facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients, and medical personnel.' Hamas has denied claims its operatives were present at the hospital, accusing Israeli forces of storming it on Friday. 'The enemy's lies about the hospital aim to justify the heinous crime committed by the occupation army today, involving the evacuation and burning of all hospital departments as part of a plan for extermination and forced displacement,' Hamas said in a statement. Gaza's health ministry had earlier quoted Abu Safiyeh reporting that the military had 'set on fire all surgery departments of the hospital.' Abu Safiyeh said the military had also 'evacuated the entire medical staff and displaced people.' 'There are a large number of injuries among the medical team.' Iran, which backs Hamas, 'strongly condemned the brutal attack,' with a foreign ministry statement calling it 'the latest example of war crimes, crimes against humanity, gross violations of international law and norms.' Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The Israeli military has regularly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces throughout the war. Hamas has denied the accusations. The WHO reiterated its call for a ceasefire. 'This raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital comes after escalating restrictions on access for WHO and partners, and repeated attacks on or near the facility since early October,' the WHO said. 'Such hostilities and the raids are undoing all our efforts and support to keep the facility minimal functional. The systematic dismantling of the health system in Gaza is a death sentence for tens of thousands of Palestinians in need of health care.' Meanwhile, Hamas's media center reported 'massive Israeli air and artillery strikes in Beit Hanoun,' in northern Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed hundreds of militants since the stepped-up assault in northern Gaza began on October 6, while rescuers in the area say thousands of civilians have died in the sweeping offensive. Gaza civil defense also reported that in a separate Israeli strike in central Gaza at least nine Palestinians were killed on Saturday. The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year, which resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,436 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the U.N. considers reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/major-gaza-hospital-shut-after-israeli-raid-officials-say/7916848.html	2024-12-28T01:59:45-08:00	
Israel says it intercepted missile from Yemen, day after Sanaa hit with strikes	SANAA, YEMEN — The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Saturday, a day after the Houthi-held capital Sanaa was hit by fresh airstrikes. Sirens sounded in areas of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea on Saturday as 'a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted ... prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the Israeli military said. The day before, a fresh airstrike hit Sanaa, which Houthi rebels blamed on 'U.S.-British aggression' though it remains unclear who was behind it. There was no comment from Israel, the United States or Britain. 'I heard the blast. My house shook,' one Sanaa resident told AFP late Friday. The Iran-backed Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing Sanaa and ousting the government in 2014. Since the eruption of war in Gaza in October last year, the Houthis -- claiming solidarity with Palestinians -- have fired a series of missiles and drones at Israel. They have stepped up their attacks since November's ceasefire between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has also struck Yemen, including targeting Sanaa's international airport on Thursday in an attack that came as the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. The Houthis have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, prompting reprisal strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain. Earlier Friday, before the strike on Sanaa, tens of thousands of people gathered to protest and express solidarity with Palestinians. 'The equation has changed and has become: (targeting) airport for airport, port for port, and infrastructure for infrastructure,' Houthi supporter Mohammed al-Gobisi said. 'We will not get tired or bored of supporting our brothers in Gaza.' The war in Gaza was triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Airport damaged Israel's strike on the Sanaa international airport on Thursday shattered windows and left the top of the control tower a bombed-out shell. A witness told AFP that the raids also targeted the adjacent Al-Dailami air base, which shares the airport's runway. 'The attack resulted in four dead until now and around 20 wounded from staff, airport and passengers,' Houthi Deputy Transport Minister Yahya al-Sayani said. It occurred as the head of the U.N.'s World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was preparing to fly out, and left one U.N. crew member injured. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of U.N. staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He later posted on social media that he had safely reached Jordan with his team. He said the injured member of the U.N.'s Humanitarian Air Service 'underwent successful surgery and is now in stable condition.' Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that the WHO chief was there. An Israeli statement said its targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida -- a major entry point for humanitarian aid -- as well as other facilities at several ports. Houthis use these sites 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. But U.N. humanitarian coordinator Julien Harneis said the airport was 'a civilian location' which the UN also uses, and the strikes took place as 'a packed civilian airliner from Yemenia Air, carrying hundreds of Yemenis, was about to land.' Although the plane 'was able to land safely ... it could have been far, far worse,' Harneis said. In his latest warning to the Houthis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's strikes would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Despite the damage, flights at Sanaa airport resumed at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday, deputy transport minister Sayani said. Yemenis depend on aid U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the escalation in hostilities and said bombing transportation infrastructure threatened humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80% of the population depends on aid. The United Nations has called Yemen 'the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,' with 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian aid and protection. The airport is 'absolutely vital' to continue transporting aid for Yemen, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Harneis said. 'If that airport is disabled, it will paralyze humanitarian operations.' After the attack on Sanaa airport, Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv and launched drones at the city and a ship in the Arabian Sea. The Israeli military said the same day a missile launched from Yemen had been intercepted. Israeli 'aggression will only increase the determination and resolve of the great Yemeni people to continue supporting the Palestinian people,' a Houthi statement said Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-intercepted-missile-from-yemen-day-after-sanaa-hit-with-strikes/7916831.html	2024-12-28T00:17:29-08:00	
Amputees in Sierra Leone turn to farming to combat discrimination	FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE — Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass. 'They forgot I had one leg,' the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: 'We fall and we rise.' The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels. But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country. Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week. More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets. 'No one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,' Makieu said. The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees' confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They've trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work. The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter. At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor. 'Many (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don't believe they have love,' the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war. First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital. But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders. His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don't fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many. Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child. Makieu wants to inspire future farmers. 'It's my dream to teach people about life. It's about changing your mindset,' he said. Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke. 'We are created for fellowship, not isolation,' he said. 'When we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.' Makieu interjected: 'I sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.' But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support. Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master's degree in social work, he cannot find a job. 'Even if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,' Kani said. Sierra Leone's National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination. Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education. But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. 'The government don't keep their promises. It's inhumane,' Kani said. There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said. Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions. A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand. Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population. Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone. Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer. 'Any successful story, there must be painful experiences,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amputees-in-sierra-leone-turn-to-farming-to-combat-discrimination/7916767.html	2024-12-28T00:04:54-08:00	
Somali migrant who survived boat sinking wants to try again for Europe	MOGADISHU, Somalia — Idil Abdullahi Goley's journey seeking a better life in Europe started in Somalia with a $6,500 payment to local smugglers. It ended a month later with fellow migrants around her dying at sea, one of them screaming and reciting the Muslim profession of faith. The deaths of 25 migrants last month in boats off the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar brought to light yet another route that some in Africa are taking in dangerous bids for Europe. Goley was one of the 48 people rescued. She spoke to The Associated Press about the journey that thousands of Somalis embark on every year as extremist attacks and climate shocks destroy hopes and livelihoods at home. Some Somalis head for the Gulf countries via the Red Sea and Yemen. Others, like Goley, gamble on a longer sea voyage south, toward the French island territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, the poorest territory in the European Union. Somalis are among an estimated 100,000 migrants living in Mayotte, according to French authorities. The migrants are part of communities affected after Cyclone Chido leveled entire neighborhoods on December 14. The International Organization for Migration has estimated that 2 million people migrated from Somalia in 2021 in search of work, the latest data available. Children left behind Goley, 28, heard about the smugglers from friends who had traveled the route and raised the $6,500 fee from her small tea shop business in the capital, Mogadishu, and from her brother and mother. She hoped to reach Europe and pay them back. She left her three small children behind. Her journey began with a flight from Mogadishu to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Then she and others took a bus to the port city of Mombasa, where they set off in fishing boats for Mayotte, more than 620 miles (997 kilometers) away. They hoped to request asylum there. After three days at sea, the group of about 70 migrants was transferred to smaller boats, whose engines started to fail. The smugglers said they would fix the engines and left with them on another boat, leaving the migrants drifting without water and food. They started catching fish and collecting rainwater to survive. It was nearly cyclone season, and waves were choppy. Goley said she tried to save the life of an infant whose mother was also on board but struggling. 'But she died right in front of me. We couldn't hold on to her body for long and had to throw it into the sea to prevent it from decomposing, as more people perished around us,' she said. During 13 days of hunger, thirst and heat, Goley's two friends also died. She held one in her lap as she passed. 'The other screamed for help. I couldn't help her and she died shortly after, crying out loudly, reciting the Shahada,' Goley said. 'That is an image I will never forget, the suffering and helplessness we felt.' She said the ordeal ended when a fishing boat appeared on the horizon and the survivors waved for help. They offered the fishermen $100 for their rescue and were taken to a sports facility in Nosy Be in northern Madagascar. The migrants were repatriated in early December by chartered plane. Back home, Goley's mother had feared the worst. Unable to eat, she had lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds). 'When I returned home, my mother couldn't believe it until she heard my voice and saw me in person,' Goley said. Another attempt As she and the other survivors arrived in Mogadishu, the Somali president's special envoy on refugee affairs expressed hope for their future and said the government would help. 'They assured me they will never take the same risk again,' Maryan Yasin said. But Goley said she plans to attempt another journey on the same route, despite having nightmares about her ordeal. The hardships in Somalia are still the same, she said — and she did pay the smugglers' fee. 'Even if it leads me to prison, I believe I'd still find a better life than the one I have here,' she said. Her mother, meanwhile, fears this time she will never return. Other survivors are undecided as they mourn. Ahmed Hussein Mahadalle, 26, had watched helplessly as his sister Hanan, 21, died. Nothing compares to the pain of it, he said. His other sister, Haboon Hussein Mahadalle, was grateful for her brother's safe return, though he also has plans to try again. 'Hanan was courageous and vigilant. She met her fate with grace,' Haboon said, in tears. 'They say good people don't stay long, and my sister embodied all the qualities I can't begin to summarize.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-migrant-who-survived-boat-sinking-wants-to-try-again-for-europe/7915540.html	2024-12-28T00:02:47-08:00	
US agency says decongestant in many cold medicines doesn't work. So what does?	WASHINGTON — Changes are coming to the cold and cough aisle of your local pharmacy: U.S. officials are moving to phase out the leading decongestant found in hundreds of over-the-counter medicines, concluding that it doesn't actually relieve nasal congestion. Phenylephrine is used in popular versions of Sudafed, Dayquil and other medications, but experts have long questioned its effectiveness. Last month the Food and Drug Administration formally proposed revoking its use in pills and liquid solutions, kicking off a process that's likely to force drugmakers to remove or reformulate products. It's a win for skeptical academics, including researchers at the University of Florida who petitioned the FDA to revisit the drug's use in 2007 and again in 2015. For consumers it will likely mean switching to alternatives, including an older decongestant that was moved behind the pharmacy counter nearly 20 years ago. Doctors say Americans will be better off without phenylephrine, which is often combined with other medicines to treat cold, flu, fever and allergies. 'People walk into the drugstore today and see 55,000 medicines on the shelf and they pick one that is definitely not going to work,' said Dr. Brian Schroer of the Cleveland Clinic. 'You take away that option and it will be easier for them to self-direct toward products that really will help them.' Why is FDA doing this now? The FDA decision was expected after federal advisers last year voted unanimously that oral phenylephrine medications haven't been shown to relieve congestion. Experts reviewed several recent, large studies indicating that phenylephrine was no better than a placebo at clearing nasal passageways. They also revisited studies from the 1960s and 1970s that supported the drug's initial use, finding numerous flaws and questionable data. The panel's opinion only applied to phenylephrine in oral medications, which account for roughly $1.8 billion in annual U.S. sales. The drug is still considered effective in nasal sprays, though those are much less popular. Phenylephrine wasn't always the top choice for cold and allergy products. Many were originally formulated with a different drug, pseudoephedrine. But a 2006 law required pharmacies to move pseudoephedrine products behind the counter, citing their potential to be processed into methamphetamine. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Bayer decided to reformulate their products to keep them readily available on store shelves — and labeled many of them as 'PE' versions of familiar brand names. What are some alternatives for congestion? Consumers who still want to take pills or syrups for relief will probably need to head to the pharmacy counter — where the pseudoephedrine-containing versions of Sudafed, Claritin D and other products remain available without a prescription. Purchasers need to provide a photo ID. Beyond those products, most of the other options are over-the-counter nasal sprays or solutions. Saline drops and rinses are a quick way to clear mucus from the nose. For long-term relief from seasonal stuffiness, itching and sneezing, many doctors recommend nasal steroids, sold as Flonase, Nasacort and Rhinocort. 'These medicines are by far the most effective daily treatment for nasal congestion and stuffiness,' Schroer said. 'The biggest issue is they're not great when used on an as-needed basis.' Nasal steroids generally have to be used daily to be highly effective. For short-term relief, patients can try antihistamine sprays, such as Astepro, which are faster acting. Phenylephrine-based sprays will also remain on pharmacy shelves. Why doesn't phenylephrine work when taken by mouth? The experts who challenged the drug's effectiveness say it's quickly broken down and rendered ineffective when it hits the stomach. 'This is a good drug, but not when it's swallowed,' said Leslie Hendeles, professor emeritus at the University of Florida's College of Pharmacy, where he co-authored several papers on the ingredient. 'It's inactivated in the gut and doesn't get into the bloodstream, so it can't get to the nose.' When Hendeles and his colleagues first petitioned the FDA on phenylephrine, they suggested a higher dose might be effective. But subsequent studies showed that even doses 400% higher than those currently recommended don't treat stuffiness. The FDA and other researchers concluded that pushing the dosage even higher might carry safety risks. 'If you're using very high doses, the risk is raising blood pressure so high that it could be hazardous to patients,' said Randy Hatton, a University of Florida professor who co-led the research on phenylephrine. Because of its cardiovascular effects, the drug is sometimes used to treat dangerously low blood pressure during surgery, Hatton noted. What happens next? Oral phenylephrine medicines will still be with us for a while. Government regulators must follow a public, multistep process to remove the ingredient from FDA's list of drugs approved for over-the-counter decongestants. For six months, the FDA must take comments on its proposal, including from consumers and companies. Then, the FDA must review the feedback before writing a final order. Even after that decision is finalized, companies will likely have a year or more to remove or reformulate products. Drugmakers could further delay the process by requesting additional FDA hearings. For now, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association — which represents medicine makers — wants the products to stay available, saying Americans deserve 'the option to choose the products they prefer for self-care.' Hatton says he and his colleagues disagree: 'Our position is that choosing from something that doesn't work isn't really a choice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-says-decongestant-in-many-cold-medicines-doesn-t-work-so-what-does-/7914334.html	2024-12-28T00:01:58-08:00	
Death toll in Brazil bridge collapse rises to 10	BRASILIA, BRAZIL — The death toll after a bridge collapsed in northern Brazil increased to 10 on Friday, authorities said. The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge, which connects the states of Maranhao and Tocantins, collapsed on Sunday, sending vehicles and their occupants plunging into the water below. The Brazilian navy had been conducting rescues in the area, finding an additional body Thursday 6 kilometers from the accident site and a second victim Friday in the Tocantins River. 'As such, there are 10 dead and seven missing victims so far,' the navy said in a statement, updating Thursday's toll of eight dead and nine missing. More than 70 rescuers continued the search nearly a week after the collapse, using a hyperbaric chamber to allow divers to search depths of more than 30 meters. On Tuesday, Brazilian authorities had warned that the Tocantins River could have been contaminated with sulfuric acid being transported by two trucks that tumbled into the water. A third truck involved in the accident was carrying pesticides. A spokesperson for the fire department later told AFP that the tanks of all three trucks were 'intact' after the collapse. The danger from those chemicals, however, had slowed rescue and body-recovery operations for days while water analyses and inspections of the trucks' chemical tank trailers were carried out. The bridge, initially constructed in the 1960s, measured roughly 500 meters long. The causes of the collapse were being investigated, but officials said initial indications were that the central beam of the bridge gave way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-brazil-bridge-collapse-rises-to-10-/7916776.html	2024-12-27T18:53:31-08:00	
Fear, chaos grip Maputo after postelection violence	Maputo, mozambique — Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is limping back to normal but residents are still fearful because of widespread looting and vandalism sparked by confirmation that the ruling party won contested elections. Food, fuel and medicine are running low for the city's inhabitants while the daring escape of more than 1,000 inmates from a maximum-security prison is fueling wild rumors and prompted the creation of neighborhood patrols. 'My neighbor woke me up, telling me that men armed with machetes were walking around,' Maria Amelia, 55, a cleaner who lives in Matola, near Maputo, told AFP. 'When I went out, I saw my neighbors, armed with knives to defend themselves against these invaders. But I didn't see anyone. I was terrified.' Maputo bank worker Armand Tembe, 40, was also dragged out of bed before dawn. 'I haven't seen any criminals outside. But it's starting to get scary. I don't know where the country is going,' he said dejectedly. 'We stayed up until 4:30 in the morning and patrolled for something we only heard about and that no one saw,' said another woman, who wanted to remain anonymous. 'It was just hearsay. It makes it seem like a macabre plan.' Borges Nhamirre, a Pretoria-based Mozambican researcher, said that so far, 'there have been no verified reports of attacks of this kind.' But the fact that the police chief, speaking to reporters Wednesday evening, 'announced that detainees could 'visit' houses has fueled concern,' he added. 'The prevailing sentiment in the conversations suggests that the government may have invented this crisis to control the ongoing social unrest,' he said. 'Manipulation' Venancio Mondlane, Mozambique's main opposition leader, has denounced the October 9 election results as rigged. On Monday, the country's highest court confirmed victory for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. That set off riots that left more than 125 dead over several days, according to the local NGO Plataforma Decide. 'We know who the real bandits are. It's Frelimo,' Mondlane said on social networks on Friday. On the streets of Maputo, makeshift barricades were slowly being dismantled, while the army was clearing some roads, according to AFP reporters on the ground. Residents were cautiously leaving their homes to look for basic necessities. 'I'm looking for bread,' said Isabel Rocha, 29, in the Laulane district of the city, after a sleepless night because of security fears. 'The bakeries have been closed for four days. In fact, we lack everything. Even the small grocery stores are closed.' Lina Chauque, 47, sat despondently on the pavement with a large bundle containing heads of lettuce and cabbage next to her. She had been waiting for two hours with several other women for a bus to arrive to sell her products at market. 'We tried to ask for help from some trucks that passed but the drivers did not want to take us,' she said. A short distance away, cars queued patiently outside a gas station where only one pump still had fuel. 'I am looking for medicine for me and my mother,' said Tomas Panguene, 65, who suffers from knee pain. 'Yesterday I went out to find a pharmacy but the streets were still barricaded. I found what I needed this morning.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fear-chaos-grip-maputo-after-postelection-violence-/7916769.html	2024-12-27T18:01:21-08:00	
Mexico tests cellphone app migrants can use to send alert if detained in US	Mexico city — Mexico is developing a cellphone app that will allow migrants to warn relatives and local consulates if they think they are about to be detained by U.S. immigration authorities, a senior official said Friday. The move comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to carry out mass deportations after he takes office on Jan. 20. The app has been rolled out for small-scale testing and 'appears to be working very well,' said Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs. He said the app would allow users to press a tab that would send an alert notification to previously chosen relatives and the nearest Mexican consulate. De la Fuente described it as a sort of panic button. 'In case you find yourself in a situation where detention is imminent, you push the alert button, and that sends a signal to the nearest consulate,' he said. U.S. authorities are obliged to give notice to home-country consulates when a foreign citizen is detained. Mexico says it has beefed up consular staff and legal aid to help migrants in the legal process related to deportation. De la Fuente expects the app to be rolled out in January. He didn't say whether the app has a deactivation tab that would allow someone to rescind an alert if that person wasn't really detained. The government says it has also set up a call center staffed 24 hours a day to answer migrants' questions. The Mexican government estimates there are 11.5 million migrants with some form of legal residency in the United States, and 4.8 million without legal residency or proper documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-tests-cellphone-app-migrants-can-use-to-send-alert-if-detained-in-us/7916764.html	2024-12-27T17:31:05-08:00	
Anger over abductions mounts in Kenya	Nairobi, kenya — Kenyan rights groups, lawyers and politicians voiced grave concern Friday over a fresh spate of abductions targeting government critics. A small protest was organized in northeastern Embu town, where a 24-year-old man, Billy Mwangi, disappeared last weekend. Security forces in the East African nation have been accused of carrying out dozens of illegal detentions since youth-led anti-government demonstrations in June and July. The latest disappearances have been primarily young men who have criticized President William Ruto online. Police have denied involvement, but activists have questioned why they appear not to be investigating the disappearances. The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) said recent denials by the inspector-general of police were 'insufficient,' calling for him to take clear action against the kidnappers or resign. 'If indeed the police are not complicit,' LSK said, they must immediately 'investigate and prosecute those responsible.' Human Rights Watch said earlier this year that its research pointed toward a unit drawn from multiple security agencies. Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who was ousted after clashing with Ruto over the protests, also alleged on Friday that a secret unit was behind the disappearances. 'Abducting these children and killing them is not a solution. ... This is the first administration in the history of this country to target children for repression,' Gachagua said at a press conference. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said Thursday that there had been 82 abductions carried out 'clandestinely, with unidentified armed persons' since June, with 29 still missing. It listed seven people who had been abducted since December 17. Two of them — Mwangi and Peter Muteti — were taken shortly after sharing AI-generated images of Ruto dead. The Kenyan judiciary said this week that 'abductions have no place in law and indeed are a direct threat to the rights of citizens.' In a post on X on Thursday, it urged 'security agencies and all connected entities to adhere to the law to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms.' The anti-government demonstrations earlier this year were sparked by proposed tax hikes, triggering the worst crisis since Ruto took power in 2022. While large-scale rallies have mostly stopped, anger against the government has simmered, fueled by a cost-of-living crisis and continued allegations of brutality by the security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-over-abductions-mounts-in-kenya/7916747.html	2024-12-27T17:14:15-08:00	
WHO chief describes Israeli strike on Yemen airport	ZURICH — The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that he was not sure he was going to survive an airstrike on Yemen's main airport carried out by Israel a day earlier during a series of attacks on the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Speaking at the Sanaa International Airport on Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the explosions that rocked the building were so deafening that his ears were still ringing more than a day later. Tedros said it quickly became apparent the airport was under attack, describing people 'running in disarray' through the site after about four blasts, one of them close to where he was sitting near the departure lounge. 'I was not sure actually I could survive because it was so close, a few meters from where we were,' he told Reuters. 'A slight deviation could have resulted in a direct hit.' Tedros said he and his colleagues were stuck at the airport for the next hour or so as what he thought were drones flew overhead, feeding concern they could open fire again. Among the debris, he and colleagues saw missile fragments, he said. 'There [was] no shelter at all. Nothing. So, you're just exposed, just waiting for anything to happen,' he said. The Israeli strikes on Yemen came after Houthis repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel was 'just getting started' with the Houthis. The Houthi-controlled Saba News Agency said three people died in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, with 40 others wounded in the attacks. Speaking by telephone from Jordan, where he flew to Friday, helping to evacuate a U.N. colleague seriously injured at the airport for further medical treatment, Tedros said he had received no warning Israel could be about to strike the airport. The injured man, who worked for the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, was now 'OK' and in stable condition, Tedros said. Tedros traveled to Yemen to try to negotiate the release of U.N. staff and others held there. He acknowledged that he and colleagues knew the trip was risky in light of high tension between Israel and the Houthis. But such was the window of opportunity to work for the release of the U.N. personnel that they believed they had to take it, said Tedros, a former Ethiopian foreign minister. He said talks with Yemeni authorities had gone well and that he saw a chance that the 16 U.N. staff as well as employees of diplomatic missions and NGO workers held there could be freed. He declined to engage in recriminations over the attack but said his itinerary had been shared publicly and expressed surprise that civilian infrastructure should have been targeted. 'A civilian airport should be protected, whether I am in it or not,' he said, before observing there was 'nothing special' about what he had faced in Yemen. 'One of my colleagues said we narrowly escaped death. I'm just one human being. So, I feel for those who are facing the same thing every single day. But at least it allowed me to feel the way they feel. 'I'm worried about our world, where it's heading,' Tedros added, urging world leaders to work together to end global conflicts. 'I have never ... as far as I can remember, seen the world really being in such a very dangerous state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-describes-israeli-strike-on-yemen-airport-/7916743.html	2024-12-27T17:01:16-08:00	
CDC says bird flu virus likely mutated within a US patient	A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation’s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week. Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans — something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work. 'Is this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,' Osterholm said. 'Right now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn’t open the door.' The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the United States; nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. The patient in the U.S. state of Louisiana was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month. The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were 'concerning,' but the risk to the general public from the outbreak 'has not changed and remains low.' Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what’s happening with mutations carefully. 'There will be additional influenza pandemics, and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,' he said. 'We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-says-bird-flu-virus-likely-mutated-within-a-us-patient/7916733.html	2024-12-27T16:48:38-08:00	
Venezuela accuses Argentine officer of terrorism as relations deteriorate	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — An Argentine military officer who was arrested in Venezuela earlier this month has been charged with terrorism, Venezuela’s attorney general said Friday. In a statement published on Instagram, Attorney General Tarek William Saab accused the officer, Nahuel Gallo, of 'being part of a group of people who tried to commit destabilizing and terrorist acts [in Venezuela] with the support of international far-right groups.' In a news conference Friday, Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich described the charges as 'another lie' by Venezuela’s government and said that Gallo should be returned to Argentina 'immediately.' The case has ramped up tensions between Venezuela’s socialist government and the right-wing administration of Argentine President Javier Milei, whose embassy in Caracas is sheltering five high-profile opposition activists and is surrounded by Venezuelan security forces. Gallo, a corporal in Argentina’s Gendarmerie security force, was detained by Venezuelan officials on Dec. 8 after he showed up at an immigration office along Venezuela’s border with Colombia and sought permission to enter the country. Gallo’s relatives said that he had traveled to Venezuela to visit his wife, who is Venezuelan, and was in the country to spend some time with her mother. They have published an invitation letter that was sent to Gallo, and said he was on vacation at the time of his arrest. Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Argentina in August after Milei and several other Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection in July of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Argentina’s diplomats were expelled, but the five opposition activists, who had sought refuge at the ambassador’s residence to avoid arrest, remained in the building after they were denied safe passage out of Venezuela. The activists, who have been holed up in the embassy since March, recently said that Venezuelan security forces have cut off electricity and water to the residence in a bid to pressure them to leave the building. Venezuela officials have denied those accusations and said that the activists used the Argentine Embassy to plan terrorist acts. The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said earlier this week that 19 foreigners are being held in Venezuela as political prisoners. In September, two Spanish citizens who were on vacation in the south of Venezuela were arrested and accused of being part of a plot to overthrow Maduro. They were arrested just days after Spain’s parliament recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-accuses-argentine-officer-of-terrorism-as-relations-deteriorate-/7916551.html	2024-12-27T16:45:15-08:00	
US proposes cybersecurity rules to limit impact of health data leaks	Health care organizations may be required to bolster their cybersecurity to better prevent sensitive information from being leaked by cyberattacks like the ones that hit Ascension and UnitedHealth, a senior White House official said Friday. Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters that proposed requirements are necessary in light of the massive number of Americans whose data has been affected by large breaches of health care information. The proposals include encrypting data so it cannot be accessed, even if leaked, and requiring compliance checks to ensure networks meet cybersecurity rules. The full proposed rule was posted to the Federal Register on Friday, and the Department of Health and Human Services posted a more condensed breakdown on its website. She said that the health care information of more than 167 million people was affected in 2023 as a result of cybersecurity incidents. The proposed rule from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS would update standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and would cost an estimated $9 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in years two through five, Neuberger said. 'We've made some significant proposals that we think will improve cybersecurity and ultimately everyone's health information, if any of these proposals are ultimately finalized,' an OCR spokesperson told Reuters late Friday. The next step in the process is a 60-day public comment period before any final decisions will be made. Large health care breaches caused by hacking and ransomware have increased by 89% and 102%, respectively, since 2019, Neuberger said. 'In this job, one of the most concerning and really troubling things we deal with is hacking of hospitals, hacking of health care data,' she said. Hospitals have been forced to operate manually and Americans' sensitive health care data, mental health information and other information are 'being leaked on the dark web with the opportunity to blackmail individuals,' Neuberger said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-proposes-cybersecurity-rules-to-limit-impact-of-health-data-leaks-/7916725.html	2024-12-27T16:38:12-08:00	
US sportscaster Greg Gumbel dies from cancer at age 78	NEW YORK — Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster, has died from cancer, according to a statement from family released by CBS on Friday. He was 78. 'He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,' his wife, Marcy Gumbel, and daughter, Michelle Gumbel, said in a statement. In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 because of what he said at the time were family health issues. Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties. In 2001, Gumbel announced Super Bowl XXXV for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship. David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as breaking barriers and setting standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness. 'A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,' said Berson. Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998. He hosted CBS's coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS's NFL studio show, 'The NFL Today' from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004. He also called NFL games as the network's lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sportscaster-greg-gumbel-dies-from-cancer-at-age-78-/7916545.html	2024-12-27T16:03:27-08:00	
Trump asks court to delay possible TikTok ban until he can weigh in as president	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by January 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk. 'President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,' said Trump's amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case. The filings come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for January 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and 'seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-court-to-delay-possible-tiktok-ban-until-he-can-weigh-in-as-president/7916535.html	2024-12-27T15:31:45-08:00	
US appeals court halts enforcement of anti-money laundering law	A U.S. appeals court has halted enforcement of an anti-money laundering law that requires corporate entities to disclose the identities of their real beneficial owners to the U.S. Treasury Department ahead of a deadline for most companies to do so. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated late Thursday a nationwide injunction that had been issued this month by a federal judge in Texas who had concluded the Corporate Transparency Act was unconstitutional. The order marked a change of course for the court. On Monday, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit at the urging of the U.S. Department of Justice put the injunction on hold while the government appealed the Texas judge's decision. But a different panel will ultimately decide whether to uphold the judge's ruling, and in Thursday's order, the court said it decided to keep enforcement of the law paused 'to preserve the constitutional status quo while the merits panel considers the parties' weighty substantive arguments.' Those arguments will be heard on March 25, the court said Friday. Before Thursday's order, most companies had faced a Jan. 13 deadline to submit their initial reports to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The injunction had been obtained by the National Federation of Independent Business, which along with several small businesses challenged the law through lawyers at the conservative Center for Individual Rights. 'Given that we have established that the CTA is likely unconstitutional, this intrusive form of government surveillance should be halted until the law's fate is finally resolved,' Todd Gaziano, the Center for Individual Rights' president, said in a statement. FinCEN did not respond to requests for comment. Under the law, which was enacted in 2021, corporations and LLCs were required to report information concerning their beneficial owners to FinCEN, which collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat money laundering and other crimes. The measure's supporters said it was designed to address the country's growing popularity as a venue for criminals to launder illicit funds by setting up entities such as limited liability companies under state laws without disclosing their involvement. U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in Sherman, Texas, on Dec. 3 ruled Congress had no authority under its powers to regulate commerce, taxes and foreign affairs to adopt the 'quasi-Orwellian statute' and that it likely violated states' rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-halts-enforcement-of-anti-money-laundering-law-/7916461.html	2024-12-27T14:19:45-08:00	
UN approves new AU force to take on al-Shabab in Somalia	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council on Friday gave the green light to a new African Union force in Somalia that is meant to take on the Islamist armed group al-Shabab, with the soldiers due to deploy in January. The resolution was adopted by 14 of the council's 15 member states, while the United States abstained due to reservations about funding. It provides for the replacement of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, whose mandate ends on Dec. 31, by the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). Somalia is one of the world's poorest countries, enduring decades of civil war, a bloody insurgency by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab and frequent climate disasters. Representatives from Somalia and its western neighbor Ethiopia were invited to participate in the council's meeting, although they were not allowed to vote. 'We emphasize that the current AUSSOM troops allocations are completed through bilateral agreements,' said the Somali representative, adding 11,000 troops were currently pledged. On Monday, Egypt's foreign minister announced his country would take part in the new force. Tensions flared in the Horn of Africa after Ethiopia signed a maritime deal in January with the breakaway region of Somaliland, pushing Mogadishu closer to Addis Ababa's regional rival Cairo. This month, Turkey brokered a deal to end the nearly yearlong bitter dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia, although Ethiopian troops would not be involved in the new AU force. Burundi will not be taking part in the new force either, a Burundian military source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. The text adopted by the U.N. Security Council provides for the possibility of using a mechanism that it created last year, under which an African force deployed with the green light of the U.N. can be up to 75% financed by the U.N. 'In our view, the conditions have not been met for immediate transition to application of' that measure, U.S. representative Dorothy Shea said, justifying her country's abstention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-approves-new-au-force-to-take-on-al-shabab-in-somalia-/7916486.html	2024-12-27T14:18:05-08:00

Engineer pleads not guilty in US case of deadly Iran-linked drone strike	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A former engineer at a semiconductor manufacturer pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. charges that he illegally procured technology for an Iranian firm that made a key component of a drone used in a January attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members. Mahdi Sadeghi, who was fired by Analog Devices after his Dec. 16 arrest, pleaded not guilty during a hearing in federal court in Boston to charges that he engaged in a scheme to violate U.S. export control and sanctions laws. He entered the plea nearly two weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against the dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and the head of an Iranian navigation systems manufacturer, Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested in Italy. Prosecutors said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was the primary customer of Abedini's company, San'at Danesh Rahpooyan Aflak Co, which made the navigation system used in its military drone program. Prosecutors say that system was used in an unmanned drone that struck a U.S. outpost in Jordan called Tower 22, near the Syrian border, in an attack that killed three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgia and injured 47 others. The White House has said the attack was facilitated by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization of hardline Iran-backed militant groups. Iran has denied involvement in the attack, and its Foreign Ministry was quoted in Iranian media Saturday saying the arrests of Sadeghi and Abedini, an Iranian citizen, violated international law. Prosecutors said that in 2016, Sadeghi, a resident of Natick, Massachusetts, traveled to Iran to seek funding from a governmental organization for a fitness wearables company that he had co-founded. Through an affiliated Iranian company he established, Sadeghi began helping procure U.S.-origin electronic components on behalf of Abedini, who is also known as Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, prosecutors said. After taking a job at Massachusetts-based Analog Devices in 2019, Sadeghi helped a Switzerland front company for Abedini's Iranian firm enter into a contract with Analog Devices and assisted Abedini in procuring U.S. technology, prosecutors said. The electronic components Abedini obtained included the same type used in the navigation system found in the drone, prosecutors said. Sadeghi has been detained since his arrest. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell set a Jan. 2 hearing to potentially grant his release after a defense lawyer reported progress in talks with prosecutors on acceptable bail conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/engineer-pleads-not-guilty-in-us-case-of-deadly-iran-linked-drone-strike/7916458.html	2024-12-27T14:06:23-08:00

Zimbabwe to work with Russia, IAEA to establish nuclear energy	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Russian investors to establish nuclear energy as part of its efforts to end the country’s chronic power shortages, government officials said Thursday. The nation has expressed its interest in nuclear power to the IAEA, said Edgar Moyo, minister of energy and power development, and hopes to develop small, modular reactors. 'They have indicated their willingness to take us through paces until we get there,' Moyo told journalists. Establishing nuclear power is expensive and complex, said Joseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, which is the reason countries such as South Africa and Egypt have sought Russia’s assistance. The process is also ripe for corruption, he said, so transparency is critical. 'Most economists would argue that those deals cost far more than are warranted for the benefits that they would provide to their economies and to their societies,' Siegle said, 'and so there's a worry that these huge infrastructure projects become a source of corruption, both in the country where it is being built, but also vis-a-vis the state-owned enterprises that the Russians provide to build the plant. 'In the end, it becomes the public in the country that is building the plant that would be responsible for paying off these costs,' he said. Zimbabwe says its goal is to have 4,000 megawatts of power capacity by 2035 and end years of power cuts that can sometimes last up to 18 hours per day. Siegle said Zimbabwe’s power needs do not warrant a traditional large-scale nuclear reactor and suggested that the government study the lasting impact of waste disposal. '[This] has always been a concern with nuclear energy — what you do with the waste, which requires some 10,000 years for the radioactive elements to decay and not pose a health risk to society,' he said. Nuclear power also heightens security risks, Siegle said. Gloria Magombo, secretary for energy and power development, said at the media briefing that Zimbabwe aims to increase the use of other renewable energies besides hydropower, given the nation’s recurring droughts. She mentioned solar, wind and mini-hydro stations. 'We are we are looking at coming in by 2030 with up to about 2,000 megawatts' from those sources, Magombo said. Zimbabwe's current capacity for power generation is about 2,600 megawatts, according to the government. The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-work-with-russia-iaea-to-establish-nuclear-energy/7916424.html	2024-12-27T13:26:35-08:00	
Taliban hint at shielding anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan as 'guests'	ISLAMABAD — A senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan has indicated that they will continue to provide refuge to anti-Pakistan militants, describing them as 'guests' under the country's traditions. Taliban Information Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa made the rare remarks just days after the Pakistani military reportedly conducted airstrikes against suspected terrorist locations in an eastern Afghan border province. The Taliban claimed that Tuesday's attack in Paktika resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 civilians, predominantly refugees from Pakistan. While the claims could not be verified from independent sources, the United Nations said that it had 'received credible reports' from the remote Afghan province that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in the Pakistani airstrikes. Islamabad has refrained from publicly acknowledging the cross-border strikes, but Pakistani security officials anonymously confirmed and told reporters that the military action had targeted and destroyed several 'terrorist hideouts' of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group engaged in lethal attacks against Pakistan. Several key TTP commanders were also said to be among more than a dozen militants killed. 'We must honor the Afghan nation's commitment to safeguarding these guests, friends,' an angry Khairkhwa said while denouncing the Pakistani attack. He was apparently referring to the TTP in his speech aired by Taliban-controlled state television and shared via X social media platform Friday. The Taliban minister emphasized the need for Pakistan 'to draw lessons from the consequences of military interventions' in Afghanistan by Britain, the former Soviet Union and the United States, respectively, since the 19th century. 'Anyone who attacks Afghanistan or harbors such intentions must learn from the defeat of three superpowers,' Khairkhwa asserted. This is the first public admission by a senior Taliban leader regarding the presence of TTP operatives in the country. Previously, Taliban officials have vehemently denied their existence, claiming that no foreign militants are permitted to operate and pose a threat to other nations from Afghan soil. TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, has escalated attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban's August 2021 resurgence to power in Kabul, killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians and security personnel. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his government's intention to enhance economic and trade relations with Afghanistan. However, he stated that the threat of TTP-led cross-border terrorism impedes that progress. 'Unfortunately, the TTP continues to operate from there and killing innocent people inside Pakistan. This cannot go on,' Sharif said in his televised remarks to a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad. 'They must rein in TTP. … This constitutes a red line for us. The TTP operating from Afghan soil is unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stressed. Sharif said his country was ready to talk with the Afghan government to address the issue. 'But there can be no progress if, on the one hand, they seek to foster relations with Pakistan while simultaneously permitting TTP to operate with impunity,' he emphasized. Separately, the Pakistani military reported Friday that its counterterrorism operations and clashes with TTP militants resulted in the killings of over 900 'terrorists' this year, including 27 Afghan suicide bombers and fighters. The violence also left nearly 400 Pakistani security forces and officers dead, said Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military spokesperson. Who is Khairkhwa? Khairkhwa, a U.N.-sanctioned Taliban leader, was captured by U.S. forces in collaboration with Pakistani counterparts in early 2002 and subsequently transferred to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison center. He was freed along with four other senior Taliban leaders in 2014 as part of a Qatar-mediated exchange for the release of U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, American and Western-allied forces invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government due to its refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who was accused of orchestrating the deadly attacks from his Afghan bases. The Taliban leadership at the time justified its refusal to surrender bin Laden, asserting that he was a 'guest' in the country and that surrendering him would violate local traditions. Subsequently, the Taliban regrouped and launched an insurgency against U.S.-led foreign forces, using sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. Bin Laden evaded capture and fled to Pakistan, where he was eventually tracked down and killed by American troops in 2011. Taliban leaders pledged to combat transnational militant networks to prevent them from using Afghanistan as a haven for global attacks after they seized power three years ago. However, an annual U.S. terrorism report released earlier this month cast doubts on Taliban counterterrorism commitments, citing TTP's growing attacks against Pakistan from Afghan sanctuaries and the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-hint-at-shielding-anti-pakistan-militants-in-afghanistan-as-guests-/7916430.html	2024-12-27T13:22:50-08:00	
NASA spacecraft 'safe' after closest-ever approach to sun	NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was 'safe' and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the sun by any human-made object. The spacecraft passed 6.1 million kilometers from the solar surface on Tuesday, flying into the sun's outer atmosphere — called the corona — on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth's closest star. The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday. The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on January 1, NASA added. Moving at up to 692,000 kilometers per hour the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 982 degrees Celsius, according to the NASA website. 'This close-up study of the sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,' the agency added. 'We're rewriting the textbooks on how the sun works with the data from this probe,' Dr. Joseph Westlake, NASA's heliophysics director, told Reuters. 'This mission was theorized in the fifties,' he said, adding that it is an 'amazing achievement to create technologies that let us delve into our understanding of how the sun operates.' The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer toward the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun. Westlake said the team is preparing for even more flybys in the extended mission phase, hoping to capture unique events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacecraft-safe-after-closest-ever-approach-to-sun-/7916419.html	2024-12-27T13:15:48-08:00	
Senate intelligence panel criticizes CIA response to Havana syndrome	A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Friday criticized the CIA's response to so-called Havana syndrome health problems among its workforce, saying many individuals 'faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care.' The report cast no new light on the causes of the headaches, nausea, memory lapses, dizziness and other ailments that were first reported by U.S. embassy officials in the Cuban capital Havana in 2016. A globe-spanning U.S. intelligence investigation concluded in March 2023 that it was very unlikely a foreign adversary was responsible for the ailments that afflicted some 1,500 U.S. diplomats, spies, other personnel and their families. It found the symptoms, reports of which peaked in 2021 and have since dramatically tapered off, likely resulted from pre-existing conditions, conventional illnesses and environmental and social factors. Commenting on the Senate findings, a CIA spokesperson said the agency had to respond to the 'vexing' health problems as it grappled with the pandemic, and worked with other agencies to determine if a foreign power was attacking U.S. personnel and their families. 'Whether, in hindsight, we could have done better is for others to evaluate, but our commitment to ensuring our officers and their families had access to the care they needed has never wavered,' the spokesperson said in a statement. The committee's report, the product of a year-long staff investigation, was largely based on hundreds of hours of testimony from CIA officials, other U.S. officials, medical personnel and those reporting symptoms, a panel statement said. The report's declassified summary said the unknown nature of anomalous health incidents (AHIs) complicated the CIA's response, which the agency first based on an assessment that an attack causing traumatic brain injuries was responsible. That assessment, the report said, changed with intelligence analyses leading to the 2023 intelligence community finding, and was one of several factors affecting how the agency provided medical care and other benefits to those reporting symptoms. The absence of a clear definition of AHIs, uncertainty about their origins and the CIA's 'evolving organizational structure' for dealing with the issue have 'greatly complicated CIA's ability to consistently and transparently facilitate medical care,' the report said. Those factors also complicated the agency's provision of compensation and other benefits to those reporting symptoms as well as its ability to communicate clearly about AHIs to its personnel, the report continued. The agency provided medical care in nearly '100 CIA-affiliated incidents, but many individuals faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care,' it said. In another finding, it said the agency provided benefits and compensation to many personnel but access to those programs has been inconsistent and affected by the way the CIA was organized to address the issue. The CIA stopped collecting clinical data on AHIs even though some clinical studies identified unexplained clusters of symptoms, the report said, adding that Pentagon research efforts continue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-intelligence-panel-criticizes-cia-response-to-havana-syndrome-/7916368.html	2024-12-27T12:17:55-08:00	
US sanctions founder of Georgia's ruling political party	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia's ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and toward Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chair Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties 'for undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,' according to a statement. The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the United States has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. The sanctions include freezes on assets and properties that those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families. 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream's actions under Ivanishvili's leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,' the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.' Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, the longtime ruling party. Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws like those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia's membership application process indefinitely. In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country's prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-founder-of-georgia-s-ruling-political-party/7916344.html	2024-12-27T12:05:58-08:00	
US homelessness up 18% as many in America cannot afford housing	The United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness this year, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country, federal officials said Friday. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department said federally required tallies taken across the country in January found that more than 770,000 people were counted as homeless — a number that misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. That increase comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population. 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe, and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on 'evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.' Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness — one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Colorado; Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year. Disasters increase homelessness Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count. 'Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,' Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. 'As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.' The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness. Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities — especially in Western states — have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don’t violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness. Homelessness among veterans drops There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024. 'The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,' Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. 'With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide.' Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, Texas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023. California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts. The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade. Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017. The numbers ticked up to about 580,000 in the 2020 count and held relatively steady over the next two years as Congress responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency rental assistance, stimulus payments, aid to states and local governments and a temporary eviction moratorium.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homelessness-up-18-as-many-in-america-cannot-afford-housing/7916304.html	2024-12-27T12:03:11-08:00	
Boat sinks en route to Spain, dozens killed, Malian minister says	BAMAKO, MALI — Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank as they tried to reach Spain earlier this month, Mali’s Minister for Malians Living Abroad said. In a press release Thursday, Mossa Ag Attaher announced that a migrant boat bound for Spain sank on Dec. 19. The migrants in this boat 'numbered 80 at the start, with only 11 survivors,' according to the Ministry. The Malian authorities have identified nine Malians among the survivors, and '25 young Malians have unfortunately been formally identified among the victims,' the minister added. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago is seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many of those making the journey come from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and other West African countries, seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. Several of the Malian victims are from the Kayes region in the west of the country, according to Doulaye Keita, adviser to the ministry, in a statement to the AP on Friday. 'Among the 25 Malians dead, there are 8 Malians from my commune,' Mamadou Siby, the mayor of the commune of Marena in the Kayes region, told The Associated Press. 'These dead young men left my commune seven months ago to work in the construction industry in Mauritania. Unfortunately, they were in contact with their friends in Europe and America, who encouraged them to come to these countries, and in most cases, they took the perilous journey without even informing their families back home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7916336.html	2024-12-27T11:57:22-08:00	
Massive Chinese espionage scheme hit 9th telecom firm, US says	WASHINGTON — A sprawling Chinese espionage campaign hacked a ninth U.S. telecom firm, a top White House official said Friday. The Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. The White House earlier this month said the attack affected at least eight telecommunications companies and dozens of nations. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday that a ninth victim was identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks. The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication. The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of 'a limited number of individuals.' Although the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose communications were accessed. Neuberger said officials did not yet have a precise sense of how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but a 'large number' were in or near Washington. Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were 'government targets of interest,' spy on their texts and phone calls, she said. The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are 'primarily involved in government or political activity.' Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. 'We know that voluntary cybersecurity practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,' she said. The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-chinese-espionage-scheme-hit-9th-telecom-firm-us-says/7916311.html	2024-12-27T11:42:32-08:00	
Montenegro approves extradition of cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon to US	PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO — Montenegro has approved the extradition of a South Korean mogul known as 'the cryptocurrency king' to the United States, the Balkan country's Justice Ministry said Friday. Minister Bojan Bozovic has issued a deposition allowing the handover of Do Kwon, the founder of the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs who was arrested in Montenegro last year, according to the ministry. It was not immediately clear when exactly Kwon would be sent to the U.S. The move follows a months-long legal saga in the case of Do Kwon. Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition and various courts in Montenegro over the past months have brought and overturned multiple rulings to extradite Kwon either to the U.S. or South Korea. The Justice Ministry statement cited the latest ruling of Montenegro's Supreme Court which said that conditions have been met for Kwon to be extradited to one of the two countries, and that the final decision lies with the justice minister. The ministry said Friday that more legal criteria were in favor of extradition to the U.S. Kwon’s lawyers in Montenegro said they learned about the decision from the media and that their client cannot be extradited until they receive the ruling. 'Behind such illegal behavior of the minister is the fact that the courts, on two occasions ... made a decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea,' lawyers Goran Rodić and Marija Radulović said in a statement. Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. He and another South Korean were arrested in Montenegro while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a 'stablecoin,' a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-approves-extradition-of-cryptocurrency-mogul-do-kwon-to-us-/7916310.html	2024-12-27T11:41:53-08:00	
Senegal to close foreign military bases, cuts ties to ex-colonial power France	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal has announced the closure of all foreign military bases, without setting a timeline for the exit of foreign troops. Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko made the announcement Friday during a general policy statement to the National Assembly. 'The president of the Republic has decided to close all foreign military bases in the very near future,' Sonko said. France's military and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to the announcement. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye last month expressed his desire to close the French bases in Senegal. 'Senegal is an independent country, it is a sovereign country, and sovereignty does not accommodate the presence of foreign military bases,' the head of state said in a rare media interview. This decision to close bases appears to be aimed primarily at France. A former colonial power in much of Africa, France has faced opposition from some African leaders over an alleged demeaning and heavy-handed approach to the continent. France, which has already left Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, on Thursday confirmed it had pulled its last troops out of the Faya base in Chad. France’s permanent military presence in Chad ″no longer met the expectations and interests of each party″ and described the withdrawal as part of a ″reconfiguration of its system in Africa″ since 2022, the military said. French officials have said that France aims to sharply reduce its presence at all its bases in Africa except Djibouti. That includes the 350 French troops in Senegal. France could instead provide defense training or targeted military support based on needs expressed by those countries, according to the officials. Senegal's new government, which has been in power for less than a year, has taken a hardline stance on the presence of French troops as part of a larger regional backlash against what many see as the legacy of an oppressive colonial empire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-to-close-foreign-military-bases-cuts-ties-to-ex-colonial-power-france/7916172.html	2024-12-27T10:08:37-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees return from Turkey	Nearly 31,000 Syrians have returned home since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Turkey’s interior minister said Friday. Turkey is home to nearly 3 million refugees who fled Syria after the start of the civil war in 2011. The recent fall of Assad’s government has raised hope that Syrian refugees in Turkey and elsewhere may be able to return. The return of Syrian refugees comes as Turkey says it will look to provide electricity to Syria and help enhance its power infrastructure, Turkey’s energy minister was quoted as saying on Friday. Assistance for Syria is coming from elsewhere, too. Some 50 tons of European Union-funded medical supplies that were flown to Turkey through Dubai are expected to enter Syria on Dec. 31, a United Nations health official told Agence France-Presse on Friday. 'The supplies are still in Istanbul and going through the customs process,' Mrinalini Santhanam of the World Health Organization’s Gaziantep office in southern Turkey told AFP. The goal is to support Syria’s healthcare system, which was pummeled by years of war under Assad. And Ukraine already has sent its first batch of food aid to Syria, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday. The Ukrainian leader said 500 tons of wheat flour were on their way to Syria. Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat warned Friday against 'destructive interference' in Syria’s future, he wrote in Chinese state media as he visited Beijing. Iran 'considers the decision-making about the future of Syria to be the sole responsibility of the people ... without destructive interference or foreign imposition,' Abbas Araghchi wrote in a Chinese-language article in the People’s Daily newspaper published on Friday. Both China and Iran were supporters of the now-deposed Assad. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-of-syrian-refugees-return-from-turkey-/7916193.html	2024-12-27T10:07:33-08:00	
Croatia's president seeks reelection, faces several contenders in Sunday's vote	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection this weekend against an array of contenders, including the candidate backed by the conservative government. President Zoran Milanovic is seen as a favorite ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, although he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanovic served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. The continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene. Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenkovic's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party, has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive. Although the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanovic has criticized the European Union's support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, although it is a member of NATO and the EU. Milanovic has also blocked Croatia's participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'No Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia's place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. Political expert Andjelko Milardovic said Milanovic’s reelection would be good for democracy in Croatia because the ruling party holds a tight grip over all other government institutions. 'We are interested to see a balance and control of power,' said Milardovic. Milanovic is backed by center-left Social Democrats, the biggest opposition party. Some analysts believe that Marija Selak Raspudic, a conservative independent candidate polling third in pre-election surveys, could stand a better chance against Milanovic if she somehow makes it to the runoff. Selak Raspudic was close to a right-wing party in the past but now runs as nonpartisan. She has focused on economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Trailing fourth in the polls is the only left-green contender in the race, Ivana Kekin, from the Mozemo, or We Can, party, which governs Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Married to a popular rock musician, Kekin says she is a 'president for a new generation.' As a psychiatrist, Kekin has accused Primorac and HDZ of syphoning money from Croatia's health system in shady corruption deals. Four more candidates are running, but none are believed to stand a chance to reach the second round. Zagreb resident Ilka Matic said that she expects Milanovic to win another five-year mandate but that 'there is little difference between them all.' Croatia, the newest member state of the EU after joining the bloc in 2013, has around 1.6 million eligible voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-s-president-seeks-reelection-faces-several-contenders-in-sunday-s-vote/7916158.html	2024-12-27T09:53:24-08:00	
Israeli forces raid northern Gaza hospital	Israeli forces raided the Kamal Adwan hospital on Friday, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, burning large sections and forcing dozens of patients and hundreds of others to leave, officials said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it had lost contact with staff inside the hospital in the northern city of Beit Lahiya. 'The occupation forces are inside the hospital now and they are burning it,' Ministry Director Munir al-Bursh said in a statement. The Israeli military said it launched the operation to target Hamas militants near the hospital. The military said in a statement the hospital had become 'a key stronghold for terrorist organizations and continues to be used as a hideout for terrorist operatives.' Since the war began between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Israeli military has frequently accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces. Hamas has rejected those accusations. Without providing specific details, the Israeli military said it had tried to mitigate harm to civilians and had 'facilitated the secure evacuations of civilians, patients and medical personnel prior to the operation.' The hospital has been under intense pressure from Israeli forces for weeks. 'The world must understand that our hospital is being targeted with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside,' Hossam Abu Safiyeh, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said in a statement Monday. The hospital announced Thursday that five of its staff members, including a pediatrician, had been killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli military said it was not aware of a strike at the hospital and that the report of the deaths would be examined. The World Health Organization has characterized conditions at the hospital as 'appalling' and said it was operating at a 'minimum' level. Hamas said Israeli forces had stormed the hospital Friday. 'The occupation army stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, forcing medical staff, patients, the wounded, and displaced people to evacuate it,' the militant group said in a statement. Hamas also accused Israeli forces of isolating and detaining those evacuated. 'Hamas holds the occupation fully responsible for the lives of patients, wounded, and medical staff after they were cut off from communication, arrested, and taken to an unknown location,' the militant group added. The war was triggered by Hamas’ terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli data. Israel’s subsequent campaign against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, according to health officials in the territory. An additional 108,000 people have been wounded, the health ministry said. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. The majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced as they continue to face threats of famine. The enclave itself is in ruins. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-raid-northern-gaza-hospital-/7916008.html	2024-12-27T08:42:18-08:00	
Protests, traffic blockades keep up in Serbia over concrete canopy fall	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbian university students left piles of old schoolbooks outside the Education Ministry building Friday as part of almost daily street protests demanding accountability over the collapse nearly two months ago of a concrete canopy that killed 15 people in the country's north. Scattered traffic blockades were also held on various locations throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m. — the time that the concrete construction on the front of the railway station building in Novi Sad crashed onto the people below. Traffic blockades have been held every Friday since the Nov. 1 crash, lasting 15 minutes for the 15 victims. Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad, which was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Persistent protests in Serbia reflect widespread anger at the accident but also wider discontent with the rule of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Tens of thousands of people joined a rally Sunday in Belgrade led by the university students. Prosecutors arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation. Striking university students have garnered support from various walks of life, challenging the tight grip on power by Vucic's government. The movement's symbol — a red handprint telling authorities they have blood on their hands — has been used by actors, farmers and others backing the protests. In Belgrade, more than 2,000 students marched to the Education Ministry. A speaker told the crowd that 'we are sick of being called political mercenaries and attacked in the streets.' In Novi Sad, a student rally criticized the way the state-run RT Vojvodina reports about the protests and the canopy collapse. Populist officials and the pro-government mainstream media have described the protests as a 'hybrid war' against Vucic under the orders of foreign intelligence services. Though Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them. University students in neighboring Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, and the northwestern town of Banja Luka on Friday gathered in support of their Serbian colleagues and to draw attention to problems in their own country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-traffic-blockades-keep-up-in-serbia-over-concrete-canopy-fall/7916060.html	2024-12-27T08:33:05-08:00	
Slovakia confirms it can host Ukraine-Russia peace talks	Slovakia on Friday confirmed its readiness to host peace talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is open to a Slovak proposal to host peace talks with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in February of 2022. 'We offer Slovak soil for such negotiations,' Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said on Facebook. Blanar also said any talks must take place with all parties participating, including Russia. Russian officials were not present for previous talks in June in Switzerland. 'We consider the statement of the Russian president as a positive signal to end this war, this bloodshed and this destruction as soon as possible,' Blanar said. The foreign minister said Slovakia, a European Union and NATO member, told Ukraine in October about its availability to host peace talks. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico is one of just a few European leaders who have remained close with Moscow. He prompted an angry reaction from Ukraine when he met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22. Fico also has halted all Slovakian military aid to Ukraine, and he has accused Ukraine of threatening Slovakia’s supply of Russian gas. Also on Friday, the Ukrainian air force said its air defense shot down 13 of 24 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack. The air force said the other 11 Russian drones were 'lost' without causing damage. That comes as Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Friday that its forces had taken control of two eastern Ukrainian villages, according to the RIA state news agency. The ministry identified the villages as Ivanivka in the Donetsk region and Zahryzove in the Kharkiv region. VOA could not verify the Russian report.

Brazil views labor violations at BYD site as human 'trafficking'	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Authorities in Brazil said Friday they are probing Chinese auto giant BYD and one of its contractors for suspected 'trafficking' of Chinese workers building a factory in the South American country. Federal prosecutors in Brazil are weighing possible criminal action after labor inspectors found 163 Chinese workers 'in slave-like conditions' at the construction site in the northeast state of Bahia, a government statement said. The workers, employed by BYD contractor Jinjiang Open Engineering, were viewed as 'victims of international trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation,' said the statement. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing, Mao Ning, said: 'We have noted the relevant reports... and are currently verifying the situation.' She added that Beijing 'attaches great importance to protecting laborers' legitimate rights and interests, and has always required Chinese enterprises to operate in line with the law and regulations.' On Thursday, BYD and Jinjiang were quizzed by Brazilian government ministries, which said 'the companies committed to collaborate in protecting the rescued workers.' Allegations denied Brazilian officials on Monday said it had found the labor violations at the site, which is being built to be BYD's largest electric car plant outside of Asia. Bahia's regional ministry for works (MPT) ordered construction be suspended at part of the site. Inspections carried out since November found 'degrading working conditions' at the site, including beds in workers' accommodation lacking mattresses, and one bathroom per 31 workers, an MPT statement said. The workers, who spent long hours under Brazil's sun, had 'visible signs of skin damage,' the statement said. The MPT added that it suspected 'forced labor,' with workers' passports confiscated and their employer 'retaining 60 percent of their salary.' After the allegations were made public, BYD's Brazilian subsidiary said it had broken its contract with the Jinjiang subsidiary responsible for work on the site. It added that it had sent the 163 workers to stay in hotels. Jinjiang on Thursday — in a statement issued before the online hearing with Brazilian authorities — denied the slavery allegation. The company said the accusations 'seriously damaged the dignity of Chinese people' and claimed it 'made our staff feel seriously insulted and that their human rights have been violated.' A Jinjiang representative told AFP on Friday that the company would hold a press conference in Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-views-labor-violations-at-byd-site-as-human-trafficking-/7916009.html	2024-12-27T08:02:00-08:00	
Chad opposition, civil society vow to disrupt Sunday elections	Yaounde — Tensions continue to mount in Chad, with opposition and so-called civil society groups vowing to disrupt Sunday’s local council, regional and parliamentary elections. The groups say the polls will be rigged to favor current President Mahamat Idriss Deby, and are visiting towns and villages warning people to stay home to avoid possible street violence. Chadians in the country’s capital, N'djamena, say uncertainty looms in the central African state ahead of elections slated to take place Sunday. Twenty-three-year old Limana Abba, a student at the university of N'djamena, told VOA via a messaging app Friday that opponents of the elections have been visiting neighborhoods to warn people against voting. He says he is not sure he and a majority of registered voters will be able to vote because opposition and civil society groups have increased threats to attack those who vote on Sunday. In Chad, civil society groups are associations authorized to help with the country's governance, human rights and democratic process. It’s not clear if the groups threatening violence Sunday qualify as civil society under that definition. In any case, Limana has concerns about whether the military and police can protect voters, candidates and election officials, despite pledges from the government to do so. Chadian officials told state TV this week that government troops and police have been deployed to safeguard civilians and their property, and to stop what the government calls the possible use of weapons by disgruntled civilians. Ahead of the vote, political parties and aligned groups have been holding daily campaigns against the elections. Soumaine Adoum, the spokesperson of Wakit Tama, a coalition of over a hundred groups, spoke to a press conference in N'djamena Thursday. He said civilians do not trust Deby, who wants to continue his father, Idriss Deby Itno's roughly 30-year rule at all costs. He added all Chadians should stay at home on Sunday as a sign of protest against the armed conflicts, corruption, abuses of press freedom, suffocation of liberties and democracy, and illegal arrests and detention of opposition and civil society members that have characterized Deby's rule. Soumaine said the Elections Management Body, ANGE, cannot claim the elections will be free, fair and credible when Deby is preparing to use government troops to stuff ballot boxes as he did during the central country’s May 6 presidential election. Deby and ANGE denied the presidential election was rigged, and ANGE has always claimed it organizes free, fair and transparent elections free of government intervention. The elections management body is asking civilians to brave the threats and contribute to the country's development by taking part in Sunday’s polls. Scores of opposition and civil society members have been arrested ahead of the polls. Government officials say police called in several dozen people for questioning this week because of complaints from Deby's ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement that their campaign teams were attacked and election materials destroyed. Sunday’s local, regional and parliamentary elections were organized to mark an end to Chad's three-year transition period after the death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno in April 2021. The legislative elections are aimed at restoring the 188-member National Assembly that was dissolved in April 2021 when the army took power. Officials say government troops will vote Saturday, before the general voting, then be on alert to intervene in case of violence when civilians vote Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-civil-society-vow-to-disrupt-sunday-elections-/7915943.html	2024-12-27T07:35:45-08:00	
How sisterhood of writers helped Afghan women through Taliban takeover	WASHINGTON — Marie Bamyani was in a taxi in Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021, when she learned that the Taliban had entered the Afghan capital. 'I felt like a glass that breaks at once,' said Bamyani, who is now 29. At the time, Bamyani worked with a German aid organization. She said she was too young in the 1990s to remember much about the previous period of Taliban rule. The only thing that came to her mind were horrific images in the media of the Taliban executing a woman in a soccer stadium in the late '90s. For her, the return of the Taliban meant 'death for Afghan women.' The Taliban quickly imposed repressive measures against women. In a state of shock, Bamyani remembers not daring to step outside of her house for weeks. 'I was feeling numb,' she told VOA. The only thing she did was share her experience in a WhatsApp chat group with 20 other women. Those messages, collected over that first year of Taliban rule and translated into English from Dari and Pashto, are now published as a diary in the book, My Dear Kabul. Published in 2024 in Britain, the book captures firsthand the changes to women's freedoms seen in the first year, and for some, their thoughts watching the situation in Afghanistan from overseas. For Bamyani, she continued contributing to the chat group even after being evacuated to Germany in October of that year. 'We just shared our feelings about the situation in the country,' she said, adding that they never thought the messages would one day be a book. The women were part of a writer development program, started in 2019 by Untold Narratives. At the time of the takeover, they were preparing to release a separate book, My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird. That book, released in 2022, is a collection of short fiction stories, written by Afghan women. Lucy Hannah, the founder of Untold Narratives and a coeditor of My Dear Kabul, told VOA that the WhatsApp messages were collected at the writers' request. 'It is important to hear from women's voices,' said Hannah. It is also important to hear 'from voices that are not necessarily journalists, that are working people whose lives are directly affected by what is going around them who also happen to be creative writers.' She said that the 21 contributors, ages 22 to 65, were from different ethnic groups. Another contributor, Fatima Saadat, told VOA that she and the women in the chat wanted a safe place to share, without hesitation, 'what came to their mind at that moment.' Saadat left Kabul a week before the fall of Kabul, to start on her master's degree in women's and gender studies as a Fulbright scholar in the U.S. 'I couldn't believe that in a few days after I left, something like that would happen,' she said. 'I wanted to know how the girls [in the group] were doing.' Saadat said it was 'an act of courage' that these women posted what they were feeling and experiencing. 'This encouraged me when I read their messages, and I started [sharing] my feelings while in the U.S.,' she said. 'As a woman, my fear was about my human rights, women's rights,' she said. 'The return of the Taliban meant the return of conflict, horror and backwardness to Afghanistan.' It is painful when one can't get an education, leave the house, and make choices in life, said Saadat. 'Your life becomes a prison.' Since the August 2021 takeover, the Taliban have imposed rules and regulations on women and girls: They are barred from secondary and university education, working with the government and non-government organizations, traveling long distances without being accompanied by a male relative, and going to public baths and restaurants. But, Saadat said, 'Writing is the thing that the Taliban can't take away from us.' Other Afghan female writers have welcomed the book's release. Parvin Malal, who writes poetry and fiction about women, conflict and refugees, told VOA it is important for Afghan women to write about their experiences. Writing helps people when 'going through crises and dealing with mental issues,' said Malal, who is originally from Kandahar. In a December report, Rawadari, an Afghanistan-focused rights group based outside the country, found deterioration of mental health and an increase in suicide attempts and child and forced marriages among girls in Afghanistan. 'As a result of the ban on women's education, violence against women increased, which has made life difficult for girls and women' in Afghanistan, the report said. For Bamyani, she believes the current situation in Afghanistan will not remain the same. 'I am optimistic and hopeful that it will not be forever, but I hope that people inside Afghanistan will not suffer for long,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-sisterhood-of-writers-helped-afghan-women-through-taliban-takeover-/7915973.html	2024-12-27T07:24:46-08:00

Ukrainian drone attack was under way before Azerbaijani plane crash, Russian aviation chief says	Russia's aviation chief said Friday that a Ukrainian drone attack was under way in the region of Chechnya at the time an Azerbaijani airliner attempted to land before diverting to Kazakhstan and crashing there earlier this week. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, didn’t comment on statements by an Azerbaijani lawmaker and many aviation experts who blamed Wednesday’s crash on Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, but it turned to Aktau in Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea and crashed while making an attempt to land there. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Authorities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia were tight-lipped about a possible cause of the crash pending an official probe, but a member of Azerbaijan's parliament, Rasim Musabekov told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan on Thursday that the plane was fired on while in the skies over Grozny and urged Russia to offer an official apology. Asked about Musabekov's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 'The air incident is being investigated, and we don't believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Yadrov, the Russian aviation chief, said that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny, prompting authorities to close the area for air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land in Grozny, he was offered other airports as an alternative but decided to fly to Aktau across the Caspian Sea. 'The situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult,' he said in a statement. 'There are many circumstances that it's necessary to investigate jointly.' Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the crash probe, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. As the official crash probe started, some aviation experts pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. FlightRadar24 said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' that interfered with flight tracking data. Russia has extensively used sophisticated jamming equipment to fend off drone attacks. Following Wednesday's suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaiajan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to more Russian cities, cutting air links to Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara. It said in a statement that the flights will be suspended 'following the preliminary results of the investigation into the crash of the Embraer 190 aircraft operating flight J2-8243 from Baku to Grozny, caused by physical and technical interference, and considering potential risks to flight safety.' The company will continue to operate flights to six other Russian cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstan's Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. The day before, Israeli El Al suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing 'developments in Russia’s airspace.' The airline said it would reassess the situation next week to decide whether to resume the flights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drone-attack-was-under-way-before-azerbaijani-plane-crash-russian-aviation-chief-says-/7915869.html	2024-12-27T06:39:26-08:00	
Driver who killed 35 in China car ramming sentenced to death	Beijing — A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai last month was sentenced to death on Friday, state media reported. On November 11, 62-year-old Fan Weiqiu deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV, the worst attack in China since 2014. He was detained at the scene with self-inflicted knife injuries and fell into a coma, police said at the time. His case was publicly tried on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, with the verdict reached on the same day. The court said the defendant's motives 'were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society,' state media said. In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added. The court found Fan had 'decided to vent his anger' over 'a broken marriage, personal frustrations, and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce,' the report said. China has this year seen a string of mass casualty incidents — from stabbings to car attacks — challenging its reputation for good public security. Some analysts have linked the incidents to growing anger and desperation at the country's slowing economy and a sense that society is becoming more stratified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-who-killed-35-in-china-car-ramming-sentenced-to-death-/7915802.html	2024-12-27T05:24:27-08:00	
China sanctions 7 companies over US military assistance to Taiwan	BEIJING — The Chinese government placed sanctions on seven companies on Friday in response to recent U.S. announcements of military sales and aid to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory. The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said 'includes multiple negative sections on China.' China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense. The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that 'relevant senior executives' of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any. Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved. The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries. Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the 'so-called' threat from China to justify increased military spending. 'U.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,' he said at a press conference. 'This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.' The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China's domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sanctions-7-companies-over-us-military-assistance-to-taiwan/7915788.html	2024-12-27T05:17:03-08:00	
NATO to boost military presence in Baltic after cables 'sabotage'	Brussels — NATO will bolster its military presence in the Baltic Sea after the suspected sabotage of an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia this week, the Western military alliance's chief Mark Rutte said on Friday. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 submarine cable that carries electricity from Finland to Estonia was disconnected from the grid, just over a month after two telecommunications cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic. Finnish authorities on Thursday said they were investigating the oil tanker, Eagle S, that sailed from a Russian port, as part of a probe for 'aggravated sabotage.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday: 'We've got the situation under control, and we have to continue to work together vigilantly to make sure that our critical infrastructure is not damaged by outsiders.' Officials suspect the tanker is part of the Russian 'shadow fleet', which refers to ships that transport Russian crude and oil products embargoed due to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Eagle S vessel, which flies under the flag of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, was en route to Port Said in Egypt. Police suspect that the oil tanker's anchor might have damaged the power cable. Rutte said he spoke to President Stubb about Finland's probe, adding in a post on X: 'I expressed my full solidarity and support. NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur earlier on Friday said on X that the country began naval patrols to protect the undersea cable supplying electricity from Finland. In a separate statement he said Tallinn wanted to send a clear message it was ready to protect its power connections with Finland with military and non-military means. Rutte on Thursday promised NATO support to Estonia and Finland, and condemned attacks on critical infrastructure after speaking to Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal. More EU sanctions The European Union has also threatened further sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet after this week's incident. The bloc's 27 member states agreed earlier this month to blacklist around 50 more oil tankers from Russia's shadow fleet used to circumvent Western sanctions, taking the number targeted to around 80. Ukraine's international backers have looked to curb funds going to the Kremlin's war machine by imposing a price cap and restrictions on Russia's key oil exports. To skirt the measures, Russia has resorted to using a so-called 'shadow fleet' of often ageing vessels that operate under dubious ownership or without proper insurance. Tensions have mounted around the Baltic since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship. On November 17 and 18 this year, sections of two telecom cables were cut in Swedish territorial waters. Suspicions have been directed at the Yi Peng 3, which according to ship tracking sites had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-to-boost-military-presence-in-baltic-after-cables-sabotage-/7915778.html	2024-12-27T05:03:37-08:00	
Germany's president dissolves parliament, sets national election for Feb. 23	FRANKFURT, Germany — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition. Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-president-dissolves-parliament-sets-national-election-for-feb-23-/7915727.html	2024-12-27T03:50:30-08:00	
Israel says struck 'infrastructure' on Syria-Lebanon border	Jerusalem — The Israeli military reported it conducted air strikes on Friday targeting 'infrastructure' on the Syrian-Lebanese border near the village of Janta, which it said was used to smuggle weapons to the armed group Hezbollah. 'Earlier today, the IAF [Israeli air force] struck infrastructure that was used to smuggle weapons via Syria to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon at the Janta crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border,' the military said in a statement. It did not specify whether the strikes were on the Syrian or Lebanese side, but they came a day after Lebanon's army accused Israel of 'violation of the ceasefire agreement by attacking Lebanese sovereignty and destroying southern towns and villages.' There is no official crossing point near Janta but the area is known for illegal crossings. The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, has also expressed concern over 'continuing destruction' caused by Israeli forces in south Lebanon. The Israeli military said Friday's strikes were aimed at preventing weapons falling into the hands of Hezbollah, with whom it fought a land and air war for more than a year until a ceasefire was agreed upon last month. 'These strikes are an additional part of the IDF's [Israeli military's] effort to target weapons smuggling operations from Syria into Lebanon, and prevent Hezbollah from re-establishing weapons smuggling routes,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the state of Israel in accordance with the understandings in the ceasefire agreement.' The truce went into effect on November 27, about two months after Israel stepped up its bombing campaign and later sent troops into Lebanon following nearly a year of exchanges of cross-border fire initiated by Hezbollah over the war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-struck-infrastructure-on-syria-lebanon-border-/7915712.html	2024-12-27T03:33:47-08:00	
Houthis claim new attacks on Israel after strikes hit Yemen airport	Sanaa — Yemeni rebels claimed a strike against the airport in Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv on Friday, after Israeli air strikes hit rebel-held Sanaa's international airport and other targets in Yemen. The Israeli strikes on Thursday landed as the head of the UN's World Health Organization said he and his team were preparing to fly out from Yemen's Houthi rebel-held capital. Hours later on Friday, the Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion airport and launched drones at Tel Aviv as well as a ship in the Arabian Sea. No other details were immediately available. Yemen's civil aviation authority said the airport planned to reopen on Friday after the strikes that it said occurred while the UN aircraft 'was getting ready for its scheduled flight.' The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was there. Israel's attack came a day after the Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed the firing of a missile and two drones at Israel. Yemen's Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel since late November when a ceasefire took effect between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Lebanon's Hezbollah. The Houthis Al-Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes killed six people, after earlier Houthi statements said two people died at the rebel-held capital's airport, and another at Ras Issa port. The strikes targeting the airport, military facilities and power stations in rebel areas marked the second time since December 19 that Israel has hit targets in Yemen after rebel missile fire towards Israel. In his latest warning to the rebels, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Yemenis depend on aid UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the 'escalation' in hostilities between Israel and the Houthis and called the Sanaa airport strikes 'especially alarming.' He said bombing transportation infrastructure posed a threat to humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population is dependent on aid. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of UN staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He said he and other UN staff were about to board their flight when 'the airport came under aerial bombardment.' 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged,' Tedros said on X, adding that he and United Nations staff were safe. A witness told AFP that 'more than six' attacks struck the rebel-held capital's airport, with raids also targeting the adjacent Al-Dailami air base. A series of strikes also targeted a power station in Hodeida, on the rebel-held coast, a witness and Al-Masirah TV said. Following rebel attacks against Israel, Israeli strikes had already twice this year hit Hodeida, a major entry point for humanitarian aid to impoverished Yemen, which has been ravaged for years by its own war. On December 19, after the rebels fired a missile towards Israel and badly damaged a school, Israel for the first time struck targets in Sanaa. It said the strikes were against ports and energy infrastructure that 'effectively contributed to' Houthi military actions. Houthi media said those strikes killed nine people. In the latest attacks, the Israeli military said its 'fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes on military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime.' 'Iranian weapons' The targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida, as well as other facilities at Hodeida, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports, an Israeli statement said. The targets were used by Houthis 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. Iran's foreign ministry condemned Israel's strikes as a 'clear violation of international peace and security and an undeniable crime against the heroic and noble people of Yemen.' Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose top leaders Israel has killed during the war in the Gaza Strip, condemned the attack as an 'aggression' against its 'brothers from Yemen.' Almost a week ago, on December 21, Israel's military and emergency services said a projectile fired from Yemen wounded 16 people in Israel's commercial center, Tel Aviv. The Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at Israel since the Gaza war began in October last year, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. They have similarly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, waters vital to world trade. Scores of drone and missile attacks on cargo ships have prompted reprisal strikes against Houthi targets by U.S. and sometimes British forces. In July, a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting the first Israeli retaliation on Hodeida. The Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing the capital and ousting the internationally recognized government in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition in March 2015 began a military campaign to dislodge them that was unsuccessful, despite what the Yemen Data Project, an independent tracker, said were more than 25,000 coalition air raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-claim-new-attacks-on-israel-after-strikes-hit-yemen-airport-/7915693.html	2024-12-27T03:18:43-08:00	
Estonia's navy to protect Baltic Sea power link after cable damage	STOCKHOLM — Estonia's armed forces have launched a naval operation to protect the Estlink 1 undersea power cable in the Baltic Sea in response to the damage this week of a parallel electricity line, Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on Friday. Finland on Thursday seized a ship carrying Russian oil on suspicion the vessel caused an outage of the Estlink 2 undersea power cable which, like Estlink 1, connects Finland and Estonia, and that it also damaged four internet lines. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert for acts of sabotage following a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, although subsea equipment is also subject to technical malfunction and accidents. Damage to subsea installations in the region has now become so frequent that it is difficult to believe this was caused merely by accident or poor seamanship, Tsahkna said on Thursday. Finnish investigators believe the seized ship -- the Cook Island-registered ship, named as the Eagle S -- may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, one of several such incidents in recent years. 'If there is a threat to the critical undersea infrastructure in our region, there will also be a response,' Tsahkna said on social media X. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 in operation between the two countries, operators Fingrid and Elering have said. Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Friday that the Baltic country had despatched a patrol ship, the Raju, to the waters where the Estlink 1 runs, and that the country hoped NATO allies would also deploy ships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-s-navy-to-protect-baltic-sea-power-link-after-cable-damage/7915662.html	2024-12-27T02:15:28-08:00	
Seoul: North Korean soldier captured in Russia-Ukraine war dies	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A North Korean soldier who was captured while fighting in Russia's war against Ukraine has died of his wounds, South Korea's spy agency said Friday. Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russia's military, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August. One of those North Korean soldiers was captured alive by the Ukrainian army on Thursday, a South Korean intelligence source told AFP, adding that the location where he was seized was not known. Hours later, Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that the soldier had succumbed to his wounds. 'It has been confirmed through an allied intelligence agency that the North Korean soldier captured alive on December 26th has just passed away due to worsening wounds,' the South's spy agency said in a statement. Friday's confirmation came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been 'killed or wounded' so far as they joined Russian troops in combat. South Korea's intelligence service had previously put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 1,000, saying the high casualty rate could be down to an unfamiliar battlefield environment and their lack of capability to counter drone attacks. Pyongyang's soldiers were also being 'utilized as expendable front-line assault units,' lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun said, speaking last week after a briefing by South Korea's spy agency. 'Dangerous expansion' North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A landmark defense pact between Pyongyang and Moscow signed in June came into force this month, with Russian President Vladimir Putin hailing it as a 'breakthrough document.' North Korean state media said Friday that Putin sent a New Year's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying 'the bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang.' Ukraine's allies have called Pyongyang's growing involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine a 'dangerous expansion' of the conflict. Seoul's military believes that North Korea was seeking to modernize its conventional warfare capabilities through combat experience gained in the Russia-Ukraine war. NATO chief Mark Rutte had also said that Moscow was providing support to Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs in exchange for the troops. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Monday that Pyongyang is reportedly 'preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers' and supplying '240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery' to the Russian army. Pyongyang's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine had prompted warnings from Seoul. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, said in November that Seoul was 'not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons' to Ukraine, which would mark a major shift to a long-standing policy barring the sale of weapons to countries in active conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seoul-north-korean-soldier-captured-in-russia-ukraine-war-dies/7915658.html	2024-12-27T02:05:27-08:00	
South Korean lawmakers impeach acting President Han Duck-soo	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean lawmakers impeached the acting president on Friday, as the country struggles to shake off political turmoil sparked by his predecessor's martial law declaration that shocked the world. Han Duck-soo took over as acting president from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended following a parliamentary vote over his move to impose martial law on Dec. 3. However, opposition MPs demanded Han, who is also prime minister, be removed from office as well, arguing that he had refused demands to complete Yoon's impeachment process and to bring him to justice. 'I announce that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo's impeachment motion has passed. Out of the 192 lawmakers who voted, 192 voted to impeach,' said National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik. Counting for the impeachment was delayed as ruling People's Power Party (PPP) lawmakers protested in parliament after Woo said only a simple majority was needed in the 300-member parliament to proceed with the impeachment. PPP lawmakers began chanting angrily and many rushed towards Woo, demanding that he resign. They did not take part in the vote. It became the second impeachment of a South Korean head of state in just two weeks, adding to the turmoil of the country's dynamic political landscape. It was also South Korea's first impeachment of an acting president. PPP leader Kweon Seong-dong said after the vote that Han 'must continue to lead state affairs without yielding to the opposition's passage of the impeachment motion.' However, Han said in a statement after the vote that he 'respects the parliament's decision' and would wait for the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision whether to uphold it. The opposition said in its impeachment motion that Han was 'intentionally avoiding the special investigation to probe those involved in the insurrection and has clearly stated his intention to reject the appointments of three Constitutional Court judges.' Such actions, it said, were 'in violation of a public official's duty to uphold the law... and serve the public.' Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will step in as acting president in Han's place. Choi had pleaded with the opposition lawmakers not to go ahead with the motion. 'An impeachment motion against the acting authority is no different from an impeachment motion against the entire Cabinet,' he told a news conference with other Cabinet members earlier on Friday. 'Our economy and people's livelihoods, which are walking on thin ice in a national emergency, cannot bear the expansion of political uncertainty surrounding the acting authority,' he said. 'True colors' At the heart of the current row is the composition of the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to uphold parliament's decision to impeach Yoon and now Han. The court is currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon. The opposition wanted Han to approve three more nominees to fill the nine-member bench, which he had refused to do, leaving both sides in deadlock. Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges 'revealed his true colors,' said Democratic Party lawmaker Jo Seoung-lae. The refusal 'is a direct challenge to the Constitution and the law,' said Jo. They sought to impeach Han to 'restore constitutional order and stabilize state affairs.' Han had said he wanted his PPP and the opposition to reach a compromise on the nominees. 'The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,' Han argued. 'A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached,' the 75-year-old career bureaucrat said. The Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday despite the latest controversy. Yoon's legal team said they would attend a preparatory hearing of the court's impeachment trial at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). The South Korean won plummeted to 1480.2 per U.S. dollar on Friday morning, marking its lowest level in nearly 16 years. The won earlier plunged to a two-year low against the dollar after the declaration of martial law as investors, already concerned about the state of Asia's number four economy, shunned the currency. Police said on Friday that they had begun a raid on a presidential safe house and were collecting footage from nearby security cameras as part of the martial law probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-lawmakers-impeach-acting-president-han-duck-soo/7915650.html	2024-12-27T01:53:26-08:00	
Japan approves record budget for aging population, defense	TOKYO — Japan's government on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, ramping up spending on social welfare as the population ages, and defense to tackle regional threats. The $730 billion budget for the year from April 2025, approved by the Cabinet, includes $55 billion in defense spending. It also includes social security spending of around 38.3 trillion yen -- up from 37.7 trillion the previous year. The defense ministry said in a briefing document that Japan was facing its 'toughest and most complex security environment' since World War II, repeating a warning from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japan has a pacifist post-war constitution, which limits its military capacity to ostensibly defensive measures. But it updated key security and defense policies in 2022, explicitly outlining the challenge posed by China, and committed to double its defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP by 2027. The $55 billion approved Friday will help pay for measures to help attract recruits to Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and to improve relations between the U.S. and Japanese militaries with locals in Okinawa. It will also go towards a system to collect satellite information on ballistic missiles, such as those fired by North Korea, and the movement of vessels in waters around Japan, including territories disputed with China. 'Strengthening our defense capabilities is something we're actively working on,' Ishiba said at an event organized by the Yomiuri newspaper on Thursday. 'Now matter how great our military tanks or vehicles are, it's pointless if we don't have enough people to move them,' said the prime minister, who has pledged to fix a shortage of new troops. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. Japan is one of the world's oldest societies, and this year the proportion of its people aged 65 or overreached a record 29.3%. The draft budget needs to be approved by the parliament, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito will need cooperation from opposition parties, having lost their majority in an October snap election. Ishiba has stayed on as prime minister despite leading the coalition to its worst general election result in 15 years. A vote to elect parliament's upper house will be held in summer 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-record-budget-for-aging-population-defense/7915608.html	2024-12-26T22:21:33-08:00
